<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">while ago and thank you for that what</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">maybe you could tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">about yourself and your background and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">you know what&#39;s brought you into this</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">whole sphere of the the internet that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">find ourselves in yeah sure thank you I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">mean definitely feeling that energy as</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:57.390" style="s2">well I&#39;m just smiling yeah well look I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">mean I think possibly like most everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.390" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">here I&#39;m here because I was following</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">questions and an embodied sense and need</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">ultimately for meaning in life to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">something with it that was valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">make sense of it in a way that afforded</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">me to do meaningful and valuable things</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:22.970" style="s2">and fundamentally that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">nested in a sense of love which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.970" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">somehow an ask and on asking I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">used those words before to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:35.689" style="s2">but things seem to ground out in just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">fundamental affirmation of being and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.689" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">then you sort of have to work up like</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">what the we are doing here like can</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">we do things that are helpful or not and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2">that journey goes back a long way so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">know like everyone begins begins while</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.500" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">in the womb fundamentally you can speak</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">about it from like a stanislav grof</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">perspective which i think is quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">interesting the perinatal matrices of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:03.229" style="s2">these stages of the birthing process</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">which have arguable effects on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.229" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">dynamics of the psyche as it unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">throughout life but we&#39;re all used to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">talking about things and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">developmental terms like how we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">when we were children what opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">were afforded to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">what kind of traumas we experienced what</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">things we were able to learn and how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">came to mature and so the story begins</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:29.100" style="s2">there for me but skipping a whole way</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">down look I mean John vivec II his work</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">I think is fantastic and his pedagogy is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">as good as his work which is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.270" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">fantastic and it was someone whose ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">I came into contact with in around 2014</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">2015 and I found that it was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">refuge point or at least knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">there was a not that I was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">scientific explanations and of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">there are limits to what John is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:04.380" style="s2">even looking for science to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">regarding at least relevance obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.380" end="00:03:11.070" style="s2">he thinks we can have a science of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">relevance realization but it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.070" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">like a bit of a lighthouse for me in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:21.989" style="s2">world of institution because I never</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">really found any professor in my years</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.989" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">of studying at different universities so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">I did a Bachelor in philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.630" style="s2">international relations and a master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">in philosophy which I almost failed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.630" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">you know took many years to complete</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:36.150" style="s2">because I was pursuing independent</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">research that was basically stemming</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.150" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">from an interest in psychedelics and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.780" end="00:03:43.049" style="s2">dissatisfaction with the state of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">philosophy of mind so taking a hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.049" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">problem very seriously but feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">from within analytic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:52.110" style="s2">essentially everyone is basically in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:54.390" style="s2">equipped to actually integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.110" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">quality of consciousness with Theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:03:58.579" style="s2">building there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">disembodied about the whole project and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.579" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make appropriate doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.180" style="s2">into appropriate relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:08.010" style="s2">mystical to say nothing and to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.180" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">little let&#39;s say nothing of that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.010" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">people are still hung up on the quality</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">of the color red you know obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for that as an example</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:17.970" style="s2">of qualia just kind of like a base feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">of consciousness and what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.970" end="00:04:24.210" style="s2">liked but I wish is felt man there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:25.139" style="s2">this what it is to be is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.210" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.139" end="00:04:33.240" style="s2">in in continued quality and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">felt that in sort of in keeping with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.240" end="00:04:40.949" style="s2">breakdown of teacherly Authority in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">institutions writ large in keeping with</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.949" end="00:04:47.939" style="s2">the kind of senescence and inadequacy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:49.889" style="s2">our institutions writ large and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.939" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">perhaps our culture writ large elements</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.889" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">of it you know not meaning to be flippin</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:54.750" style="s2">about that I felt as though the only way</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:57.659" style="s2">I could ever kind of have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.750" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">conversations I wanted to have and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.659" end="00:05:03.719" style="s2">only way I could feel to contribute in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:07.889" style="s2">way that felt appropriate was to undergo</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.719" end="00:05:11.789" style="s2">some process of creating a table even as</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.889" end="00:05:14.219" style="s2">I spoke at it so this wasn&#39;t really a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.789" end="00:05:16.229" style="s2">place to to be to have the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.219" end="00:05:17.879" style="s2">conversations I wanted to have now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.229" end="00:05:19.289" style="s2">said you know John&#39;s work was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.879" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">like a lighthouse and it was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.289" end="00:05:24.090" style="s2">few places it was but you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:27.599" style="s2">from Canada and my life didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.090" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">take those turns so as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.599" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">podcast goes you know that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.460" end="00:05:35.610" style="s2">journey of three three and a half years</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">a bit longer and it is has been an</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.610" end="00:05:39.750" style="s2">attempt really from the beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:41.909" style="s2">have the kind of conversations that now</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.750" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">I referred to as the kind of deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.909" end="00:05:45.000" style="s2">conversations I&#39;m still a bit sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">hesitant about using that language</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.000" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">myself because I think it has sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:54.089" style="s2">sacred connotations and also you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:56.009" style="s2">it&#39;s been largely wouldn&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.089" end="00:06:00.500" style="s2">say it&#39;s been defined precisely but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.009" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">being discussed and enacted in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.500" end="00:06:05.159" style="s2">environments that I&#39;m often not a part</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:08.069" style="s2">of and so I feel like well to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.159" end="00:06:11.789" style="s2">doing that thing might be not that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.069" end="00:06:14.039" style="s2">helpful in some sense but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.789" end="00:06:16.949" style="s2">it has a placeholder term it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.039" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what it&#39;s about so here</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.949" end="00:06:21.270" style="s2">we are you know I&#39;m just keen to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:23.339" style="s2">chat with you guys and whether this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.270" end="00:06:26.909" style="s2">Q&amp;A or just an opportunity for us all to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.339" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">talk together you know I&#39;m equally</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.909" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">interested so it&#39;s really nice to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:45.660" style="s2">throughout three words you know simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.420" end="00:06:47.670" style="s2">words are not so simple and and get your</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.660" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">take on them and and these are words</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.670" end="00:06:51.960" style="s2">that you&#39;ve said just now and that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:56.910" style="s2">speak a lot of but these words are</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:07:00.300" style="s2">meaning love and sacred how how do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.910" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">frame those those words what is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.300" end="00:07:09.510" style="s2">mean to you it&#39;s interesting when isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.830" end="00:07:12.090" style="s2">it because I think we probably all use</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.510" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">that word to me like ten hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.090" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">different things so it often kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.420" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">depends what mode of communication I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:22.470" style="s2">engaging in I communicate to myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:24.930" style="s2">quite differently when I&#39;m writing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.470" end="00:07:26.730" style="s2">that&#39;s mainly to myself it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.930" end="00:07:28.500" style="s2">designed always to be that way but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.730" end="00:07:31.230" style="s2">find that the expression that comes out</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.500" end="00:07:34.680" style="s2">when I&#39;m trying to be absolutely clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.230" end="00:07:37.350" style="s2">with language is not that exceptionally</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.680" end="00:07:39.780" style="s2">translatable to speaking would sound</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.350" end="00:07:41.460" style="s2">disjointed and technical but what would</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.780" end="00:07:43.890" style="s2">I mean I would mean something meaning as</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.460" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">in one sense you can I take it at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.890" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">as kind of a a term that gestures or</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:08:02.490" style="s2">references at the a a kind of nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:08:06.030" style="s2">affectation a quality type dynamic which</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.490" end="00:08:08.280" style="s2">is inherently a relational so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.030" end="00:08:09.720" style="s2">say some process as I wanna say unit</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.280" end="00:08:12.450" style="s2">like little thing but if it it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.720" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a dynamic relation so in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.450" end="00:08:18.450" style="s2">sense of John talking about the trans</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">Jack tivity and meaning being a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.450" end="00:08:22.260" style="s2">a dynamical relation sort of realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.700" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">through a reciprocal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:29.660" style="s2">between agent and arena so it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:29.660" style="s2">of it&#39;s a kind of fluid coupling</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.750" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">effectivity it exists in this trans Jace</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.840" end="00:08:43.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a duration that we participate in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">so like what so I mean in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.710" end="00:08:47.460" style="s2">people talk about intentionality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:49.530" style="s2">the discourse of our intentionality in</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.460" end="00:08:51.330" style="s2">the philosophy of mind which is how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.530" end="00:08:52.710" style="s2">our words or how do our gestures or how</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:55.770" style="s2">do our science come to have kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.710" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">of how do they map onto things how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.770" end="00:09:01.470" style="s2">actually map onto the world what what do</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">our words what gives them the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.470" end="00:09:08.520" style="s2">their meaning how do we get to actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">pick something out and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.520" end="00:09:14.730" style="s2">partly something like that as well like</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:20.280" style="s2">what enables us to differentiate between</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.730" end="00:09:21.870" style="s2">what are many many meanings or so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.280" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.870" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">I mean spoken about kind of in that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a bit amorphous right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:34.290" style="s2">kind of like everything&#39;s meaning but</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">then we differentiate and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.290" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">perhaps a hierarchy of meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:41.190" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not the right word to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:43.560" style="s2">we realize some meanings as more</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.190" end="00:09:46.230" style="s2">relevant than others and undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.560" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">these processes like for John obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.230" end="00:09:50.430" style="s2">backed on underground like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.930" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">underground of it is that relevance</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.430" end="00:09:54.270" style="s2">realization up and down the stack of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:10:00.600" style="s2">different kinds of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.270" end="00:10:03.960" style="s2">perception we come to differentiate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:07.640" style="s2">integrate and all together build a world</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.960" end="00:10:11.610" style="s2">and enact ourselves in a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.640" end="00:10:15.030" style="s2">coherent or more or less coherent so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.610" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">meanings form some kind of picture or</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.030" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">perhaps story but not just a story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">got its you know it depends what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:24.080" style="s2">mean by story but it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">constituent elements of what enables</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.080" end="00:10:29.220" style="s2">really things to make sense to us</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.670" end="00:10:30.780" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.220" end="00:10:32.520" style="s2">much of a definition definition is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.780" end="00:10:35.130" style="s2">but it&#39;s so it&#39;s so like images that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.520" end="00:10:40.530" style="s2">come to mind as far as sacred and love I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:42.660" style="s2">mean I I I do tend to think that Forrest</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.530" end="00:10:49.590" style="s2">Landry&#39;s phrase love is that which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.660" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">enables choice is a really beautiful non</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.590" end="00:11:00.060" style="s2">lossless compression of some deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:11:04.710" style="s2">important notions so love being for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.060" end="00:11:07.150" style="s2">love is something which both enables our</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.710" end="00:11:10.930" style="s2">appropriate attachment and appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.150" end="00:11:17.910" style="s2">detachment so love is something that can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.930" end="00:11:22.810" style="s2">let go as well as be in intimate</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.910" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">proximal touch with which is a quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.810" end="00:11:29.080" style="s2">remarkable thing that we can both love</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.840" style="s2">something and let it go so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.080" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">enabling there love is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.840" end="00:11:37.990" style="s2">inherently enabling of the other and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:43.090" style="s2">for forest love is that which enables</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.990" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">choice that choice in his view you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.090" end="00:11:49.570" style="s2">is and in mind to really is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">fundamental at least to the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.570" end="00:11:55.270" style="s2">human beings we could speak about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:57.490" style="s2">metaphysically perhaps not that it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.270" end="00:12:01.050" style="s2">know he he has choice change and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.490" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">causation at the same level together but</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.050" end="00:12:11.650" style="s2">choices involved inherently involved and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.430" end="00:12:14.860" style="s2">so to enable choices to basically grant</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.650" end="00:12:18.130" style="s2">the dignity to another to realize and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.860" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">walk their own path you know even as we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.130" end="00:12:20.770" style="s2">are inherently in relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.770" end="00:12:30.700" style="s2">on our many varied paths and sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">would be I think that reality we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.700" end="00:12:36.550" style="s2">participate in that enables our paths to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">cohere together and be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.550" end="00:12:40.810" style="s2">to the whole fundamentally which to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">as a whole making because the paths are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.810" end="00:12:46.810" style="s2">always to be walked and we are in</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">relationship with potential or novelty</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.810" end="00:12:52.930" style="s2">and so the whole is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">dynamically changing and we are involved</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.930" end="00:13:06.150" style="s2">in the choices we make to enable or not</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:09.370" style="s2">that whole making so yeah meaning love</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.150" end="00:13:11.590" style="s2">the sacred that&#39;s like a pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.370" end="00:13:13.910" style="s2">beautiful concepts I hope some of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.590" end="00:13:15.950" style="s2">landed in interesting ways yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.910" end="00:13:19.670" style="s2">definitely do you think we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.950" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">disservice in modern English by</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.670" end="00:13:24.940" style="s2">combining the different types of love to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:31.130" style="s2">one word where as opposed to a gap in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.940" end="00:13:33.020" style="s2">philia and eros I mean it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.130" end="00:13:36.640" style="s2">remarkable we have language it&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.020" end="00:13:38.660" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like every day</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.640" end="00:13:41.750" style="s2">something gets revealed to me in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.660" end="00:13:43.720" style="s2">conversation with someone where people</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.750" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2">take a word I was talking to a guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.720" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">yesterday and we were playing a game</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.860" end="00:13:49.750" style="s2">called the glass bead game which I tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">you about a little bit if you like and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:54.520" style="s2">he we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:13:58.820" style="s2">relationship between masters and slaves</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.520" end="00:14:02.330" style="s2">and he was using a metaphor of a of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.820" end="00:14:05.300" style="s2">boat and he you know kind of just an</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.330" end="00:14:07.280" style="s2">improvised state of being he made the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.300" end="00:14:10.250" style="s2">link between you know masters are able</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.280" end="00:14:12.380" style="s2">to sort of raise their mast and sail</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.250" end="00:14:14.330" style="s2">away to play other games and I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.380" end="00:14:18.440" style="s2">even thought about the word mast as in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.330" end="00:14:20.990" style="s2">ship you know the part of a ship being</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.440" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">part of the word master before and I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.990" end="00:14:25.070" style="s2">just like man that&#39;s so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">awesome and these words always nested</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.070" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">inside each other like no we&#39;re just put</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:32.960" style="s2">those together or sorry you have now and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.440" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">here it&#39;s like stuff like that just</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.960" end="00:14:37.490" style="s2">blows my mind all the time you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">a bit you know kind of like cereal box</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.490" end="00:14:41.750" style="s2">wordplay etymology in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:43.220" style="s2">then another level I&#39;m like man these</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.750" end="00:14:45.560" style="s2">things are so interested how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.220" end="00:14:48.140" style="s2">retained the clues there and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.560" end="00:14:50.960" style="s2">meanings there so yeah for sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.140" end="00:14:53.420" style="s2">different kinds of love but then I also</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.960" end="00:14:55.700" style="s2">think that because we enact these</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.420" end="00:14:58.070" style="s2">different kinds of love all the time I</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.700" end="00:15:00.200" style="s2">mean to the extent we are in right</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:03.500" style="s2">relationship with each other then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.200" end="00:15:06.710" style="s2">not as though I&#39;m not convinced meanings</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.500" end="00:15:08.470" style="s2">are lost from us and of course when</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.710" end="00:15:10.850" style="s2">someone comes along and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.470" end="00:15:12.530" style="s2">partitions up or tells us about</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.850" end="00:15:13.850" style="s2">different senses of a word we like oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.530" end="00:15:15.290" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that thing and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.850" end="00:15:16.790" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s that thing and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.290" end="00:15:19.460" style="s2">language is very helpful for that and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.790" end="00:15:22.970" style="s2">can open up pathways of expression but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.460" end="00:15:24.860" style="s2">you know my parents for instance you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.970" end="00:15:27.320" style="s2">know couldn&#39;t tell you about the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.860" end="00:15:27.740" style="s2">words for love but when I was a young</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.320" end="00:15:29.930" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.740" end="00:15:32.450" style="s2">they certainly treated me with one kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.930" end="00:15:37.640" style="s2">of love and not another and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.450" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">sense how much have we forgotten in one</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.640" end="00:15:42.290" style="s2">sense a lot but then in another sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:46.270" style="s2">not much I&#39;m not trying to make much of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.290" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">a point here it just comes to me that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.270" end="00:15:52.610" style="s2">am quite interested in how we can open</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:55.430" style="s2">ourselves to things we&#39;re already doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.610" end="00:15:58.640" style="s2">and practices we engage in which in some</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.430" end="00:16:04.730" style="s2">sense have many of the answers we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.640" end="00:16:08.570" style="s2">already looking for but yeah I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.730" end="00:16:10.640" style="s2">sure we are fairly blunt instruments in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.570" end="00:16:13.730" style="s2">many ways and there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.640" end="00:16:14.900" style="s2">complexity than we often speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.730" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">one that&#39;s one more question before I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.900" end="00:16:19.850" style="s2">move to questions from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:21.170" style="s2">members so see described yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.850" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">being interested in the art of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.170" end="00:16:27.100" style="s2">transformation so what is the art of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:31.910" style="s2">transformation what makes it an art and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.100" end="00:16:34.490" style="s2">transforming into what well the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.910" end="00:16:38.950" style="s2">transformation is ongoing in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.490" end="00:16:38.950" style="s2">well in you know genuine no real sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.310" end="00:16:47.540" style="s2">and where is it going would speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:49.610" style="s2">question in some sense of teleology</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.540" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">which you touched on before we got into</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.610" end="00:16:52.820" style="s2">this chat but you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">funny the things we write about</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.820" end="00:16:57.470" style="s2">ourselves when we do little BIOS I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:17:00.860" style="s2">absolutely hate them I truly</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.470" end="00:17:03.710" style="s2">hate them and I I the only reason I put</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.860" end="00:17:09.770" style="s2">anything at all is because I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.710" end="00:17:12.380" style="s2">have to and I do want to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.770" end="00:17:15.710" style="s2">people and I&#39;m quite serious about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.380" end="00:17:20.930" style="s2">project and all of this so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.710" end="00:17:25.250" style="s2">kind of share you know see sort of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.930" end="00:17:28.460" style="s2">about myself but that ultimately attract</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.250" end="00:17:29.930" style="s2">people to collaborate with me engage</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.460" end="00:17:33.410" style="s2">with me who might be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.930" end="00:17:39.690" style="s2">similar things so definite pinch of salt</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.410" end="00:17:43.379" style="s2">hey but the art of transformation well</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.690" end="00:17:46.860" style="s2">when it comes to art we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.379" end="00:17:51.659" style="s2">create something final and correct</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.860" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">and absolutely certain exactly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.659" end="00:17:59.759" style="s2">sense in which it&#39;s a continued pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.110" end="00:18:02.330" style="s2">of beauty in one way you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.759" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think I can quite speak to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.330" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">the wonder of art exhaustively but</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.139" end="00:18:15.509" style="s2">basically what do I mean by it I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.750" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">interested very much committed to living</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.509" end="00:18:24.299" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s less then I could</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.970" end="00:18:27.029" style="s2">but said in a way that was trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.299" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">know sound smart in some sense to live</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.029" end="00:18:30.419" style="s2">in a beautiful way to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:33.629" style="s2">beautiful relationships to build</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.419" end="00:18:34.950" style="s2">beautiful things and we are always</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.629" end="00:18:38.730" style="s2">transforming you know life is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.950" end="00:18:41.129" style="s2">transforming in my own writing these</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.730" end="00:18:43.980" style="s2">things are sort of nested in sided</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.129" end="00:18:47.850" style="s2">domain which I personally reference as</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:52.590" style="s2">loving transformation I just can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.850" end="00:18:55.220" style="s2">sense of how game making a tool can</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.590" end="00:18:58.679" style="s2">occur without that which is able to both</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.220" end="00:19:03.299" style="s2">sort of affirm a game and also let it go</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.679" end="00:19:08.190" style="s2">and recreate so to have faith in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.299" end="00:19:14.659" style="s2">sense of the continuity of worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.190" end="00:19:17.519" style="s2">being through losses or through death or</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.659" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">through transformation itself which you</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.519" end="00:19:24.899" style="s2">know involves cycles of death from from</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:27.179" style="s2">some perhaps maybe not so metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.899" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">perspective you know we build things and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.179" end="00:19:34.169" style="s2">have to let them go we build</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:36.049" style="s2">relationships and they serve us to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.169" end="00:19:39.570" style="s2">certain point in time and unless we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.049" end="00:19:41.370" style="s2">unless that relationship transforms it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.570" end="00:19:43.049" style="s2">could be something detrimental to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.370" end="00:19:48.830" style="s2">flourishing of both individuals for</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.049" end="00:19:52.590" style="s2">example so how to change how to develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.830" end="00:19:53.549" style="s2">appropriately how to enter into more</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.590" end="00:19:55.830" style="s2">loving</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.549" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2">relationships be more available to write</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.830" end="00:20:03.749" style="s2">action in the world it means all of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:06.119" style="s2">kind of thing to me we&#39;ve been we talk a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.749" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">lot about transformation here and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.119" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">been playing with trying to insert some</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.519" style="s2">symbols and ritual and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.210" end="00:20:18.570" style="s2">tentatively come up with the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.519" end="00:20:21.450" style="s2">the role of aspirant which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.570" end="00:20:24.090" style="s2">where it would be more than just</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.450" end="00:20:25.799" style="s2">becoming a member here you would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.090" end="00:20:27.210" style="s2">declare yourself an aspirant declare</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.799" end="00:20:30.179" style="s2">yourself that you&#39;re looking seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.210" end="00:20:32.879" style="s2">transform your you aspire to transform</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.179" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">you aspire to you know engage in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.879" end="00:20:42.239" style="s2">ecology of practices and and to to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:44.820" style="s2">part in this in this process so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.239" end="00:20:52.100" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful yeah but we we have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.820" end="00:20:53.999" style="s2">I mean I it&#39;s kind of funny you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.100" end="00:20:58.529" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you guys have I have this</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.999" end="00:21:00.359" style="s2">experience where you might be asking</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.529" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">yourself to do something or committing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.359" end="00:21:06.269" style="s2">yourself to do something but until it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:08.940" style="s2">arrives at a certain place of expression</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.269" end="00:21:10.289" style="s2">I just keep the idea in my mind say</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.940" end="00:21:12.239" style="s2">alright I&#39;m not gonna have another</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.289" end="00:21:14.999" style="s2">cookie today but I don&#39;t properly even</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.239" end="00:21:18.210" style="s2">perform it with with thought in a way or</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.999" end="00:21:20.759" style="s2">it gets like it reaches a stay in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.210" end="00:21:23.070" style="s2">consciousness where I I could just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.759" end="00:21:24.629" style="s2">right there to be said and it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.070" end="00:21:26.909" style="s2">if I say it but I find that that voice</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.629" end="00:21:29.940" style="s2">can exist with the same kind of force</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.909" end="00:21:32.220" style="s2">and meaning just inside consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.940" end="00:21:34.139" style="s2">but there&#39;s somewhere before it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.220" end="00:21:36.679" style="s2">that where I&#39;m aware of it but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.139" end="00:21:38.940" style="s2">quite committed to it and unless I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.679" end="00:21:41.580" style="s2">you know the chances are I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.940" end="00:21:44.399" style="s2">another cookie so you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.580" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">kind of commit to things and in making</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.399" end="00:21:47.879" style="s2">those commitments to each other I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:49.379" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard John speak about in making</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.879" end="00:21:50.549" style="s2">commitments to each other we&#39;re afforded</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.379" end="00:21:52.499" style="s2">the opportunity to come to know</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:55.889" style="s2">ourselves a bit more definitely seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.499" end="00:21:58.499" style="s2">be the case I&#39;d like to move to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.889" end="00:22:02.659" style="s2">questions from the from the members so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.499" end="00:22:05.160" style="s2">strewing you have a question yeah hi Tim</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.659" end="00:22:07.890" style="s2">hello</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.160" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">so I was wondering since you recently</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.890" end="00:22:11.640" style="s2">interviewed Anderson Todd I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:13.410" style="s2">wondering whether you might have seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.640" end="00:22:15.420" style="s2">the conversation Anderson had with John</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.410" end="00:22:17.310" style="s2">tvoaqui where he suggested to join that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">alchemy was approached to a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.310" end="00:22:25.950" style="s2">science if you have do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:28.470" style="s2">thoughts to share on them yeah um I did</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.950" end="00:22:30.680" style="s2">listen I think I probably listened a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.470" end="00:22:30.680" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.450" end="00:22:47.420" style="s2">I&#39;ll be honest with you I&#39;m not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.040" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">sure what science is I my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.420" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">science is that even when we choose</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:57.540" style="s2">between scientific theories for their</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:59.370" style="s2">accuracy or for their validity or their</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.540" end="00:23:01.620" style="s2">strength or plausibility even I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.370" end="00:23:03.630" style="s2">even those things in just me trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.620" end="00:23:05.640" style="s2">reference that concept we have these</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.630" end="00:23:07.110" style="s2">different markers of what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.640" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">good science so people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.110" end="00:23:13.320" style="s2">measure ability and repeatability as</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.410" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">being you know fundamental and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.320" end="00:23:18.990" style="s2">seems to me like a good philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:22.200" style="s2">science but you know people also talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.990" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">about elegance and then they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.200" end="00:23:29.160" style="s2">you know sort of predictive validity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:31.530" style="s2">if something can be falsified and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.160" end="00:23:37.490" style="s2">know how well can it be observed and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.530" end="00:23:45.390" style="s2">properly measured and well I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.490" end="00:23:46.680" style="s2">would be I would I would be more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.390" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">and say interested because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.680" end="00:23:52.340" style="s2">interested to talk to you about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:57.810" style="s2">would sort of like to invite you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.340" end="00:24:00.390" style="s2">Anderson to expand on what he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.810" end="00:24:03.720" style="s2">takes science to be now I said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.390" end="00:24:06.690" style="s2">proto cognitive science so that is kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.720" end="00:24:09.750" style="s2">of limiting the claim proto being like</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.690" end="00:24:11.460" style="s2">sort of some kind of stage before not</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.750" end="00:24:13.170" style="s2">yet sort of fully formed but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.460" end="00:24:16.560" style="s2">heading in that direction it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.170" end="00:24:18.840" style="s2">like the the building blocks well I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.560" end="00:24:21.870" style="s2">suppose if I can clarify that&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.840" end="00:24:23.790" style="s2">what I&#39;m when I say protocol native</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.870" end="00:24:27.780" style="s2">science what I&#39;m trying to say is do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.790" end="00:24:30.810" style="s2">believe it is validity towards the claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.780" end="00:24:32.790" style="s2">that within alchemical texts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.810" end="00:24:34.650" style="s2">genuine information with respect to our</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.790" end="00:24:37.310" style="s2">psychological States and how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.650" end="00:24:37.310" style="s2">manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.200" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">yeah yeah I do think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.850" end="00:24:56.970" style="s2">we can come to increasing awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:25:03.040" style="s2">what is present in consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.970" end="00:25:10.560" style="s2">where our attention is being drawn so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.040" end="00:25:16.620" style="s2">you know what is salient to us what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.560" end="00:25:19.690" style="s2">populating our salient landscape am i</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.620" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">you know it&#39;s interesting I have to sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.690" end="00:25:25.900" style="s2">of take myself into quite a lived place</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:29.080" style="s2">to begin to talk about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.900" end="00:25:30.310" style="s2">stuff because what is great correct me</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.080" end="00:25:33.570" style="s2">if I&#39;m wrong but what&#39;s kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.310" end="00:25:36.810" style="s2">being asked is for us to step into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.570" end="00:25:43.930" style="s2">state of consciousness where we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.810" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">present with kind of potentially very</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.930" end="00:25:48.940" style="s2">volatile states of consciousness so a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">stage in that our chemical process would</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.940" end="00:25:57.160" style="s2">be I mean god they have the they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:26:00.250" style="s2">the the the fire so what&#39;s that cow I</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.160" end="00:26:03.370" style="s2">forget that if you get the word I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.250" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the calcination calcination yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.370" end="00:26:10.450" style="s2">they have the calcination I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:14.560" style="s2">sublimation they have dissolution they</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.450" end="00:26:17.790" style="s2">have the reco AG Y elation so that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.560" end="00:26:20.470" style="s2">that so the kind of letting go the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.790" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">differentiating the dissolving and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.470" end="00:26:27.310" style="s2">building back up and various ways of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:29.530" style="s2">entering these kind of states so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.310" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">other day it was about 11 a.m.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.530" end="00:26:35.080" style="s2">uh sorry 11 p.m. and I felt as though I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:38.470" style="s2">needed to move quite a bit of energy so</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.080" end="00:26:42.010" style="s2">I smoked quite a lot of weed and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.470" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">often do that but I do do it when I feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.010" end="00:26:52.470" style="s2">like I could benefit from bending some</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">quite intense time</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.470" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">moving energy and what that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:06.310" style="s2">is basically an array of visionary type</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:08.590" style="s2">experience where all the while identity</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.310" end="00:27:14.170" style="s2">itself is sort of shifting so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.590" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">clear exactly where I am I should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.170" end="00:27:18.430" style="s2">holding my ground so you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:19.780" style="s2">quite careful about your your safety in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.430" end="00:27:23.020" style="s2">some sense with that you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.780" end="00:27:25.690" style="s2">a it helps to have a capacity to really</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.020" end="00:27:28.350" style="s2">tune in and check in with the breath and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.690" end="00:27:32.550" style="s2">be in touch with one&#39;s body to be safe</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.350" end="00:27:38.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s a kind of helpful process for</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.550" end="00:27:40.510" style="s2">surfacing narratives ideas fragments of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.560" end="00:27:41.770" style="s2">relationships with people commitments</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.510" end="00:27:43.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve made things you haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.770" end="00:27:46.540" style="s2">things you&#39;ve been pushing away things</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.690" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve forgotten and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.540" end="00:27:53.620" style="s2">material that is sort of being broken up</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:56.350" style="s2">and presented and well what do we make</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.620" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">of that how do we how do we orient in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.350" end="00:28:01.660" style="s2">that space what is what does it become</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:04.300" style="s2">appropriate then to congeal together</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.660" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">right finding continuity in that Who am</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.300" end="00:28:09.400" style="s2">I in how do I like for example in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.290" style="s2">constructing this sentence right now I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.400" end="00:28:13.150" style="s2">mean because I&#39;m not that good at doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.290" end="00:28:14.920" style="s2">this I try to be better but maybe what</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.150" end="00:28:17.410" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is not that interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.920" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">some people some people are kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.410" end="00:28:21.010" style="s2">following this thing it&#39;s not making</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:22.300" style="s2">sense but maybe there&#39;s a few people</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.010" end="00:28:23.680" style="s2">where it&#39;s like are there something</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.300" end="00:28:25.300" style="s2">there you&#39;re trying to speak to and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.680" end="00:28:28.050" style="s2">kind of getting it and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.300" end="00:28:32.220" style="s2">interesting well what is that process</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.050" end="00:28:35.140" style="s2">what is that process like we&#39;re on some</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.220" end="00:28:37.390" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re tending to a channel of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.140" end="00:28:40.360" style="s2">communication what are we tending to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.390" end="00:28:42.340" style="s2">for well we&#39;re trying to seek and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.360" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">understand things I mean we have a broad</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.340" end="00:28:46.540" style="s2">sense of the game we&#39;re playing somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.620" end="00:28:48.550" style="s2">and that games nested in other games for</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.540" end="00:28:51.430" style="s2">me want to sort of develop ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.550" end="00:28:52.930" style="s2">such as to play more appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.430" end="00:28:54.760" style="s2">within a particular game perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.930" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">transform it so it might come into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.760" end="00:28:59.020" style="s2">better relationship with other games</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.170" end="00:29:00.700" style="s2">like you know these things we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.020" end="00:29:02.410" style="s2">back to what do we care about at all and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.700" end="00:29:06.010" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a question of identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.410" end="00:29:10.350" style="s2">like Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.010" end="00:29:14.440" style="s2">what is mine to do these that being</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.350" end="00:29:16.510" style="s2">temporally bounded in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.440" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">then in another sense how do we engage</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.510" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">in a process which enables us to change</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:27.420" style="s2">artfully in a kind of continuity</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:30.400" style="s2">relationship with a set of values or</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.420" end="00:29:32.620" style="s2">virtues which essentially consists in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.400" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">that which enables us to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.620" end="00:29:46.630" style="s2">play and remake games so so does alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:53.830" style="s2">offer a kind of toolkit for mapping or</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.630" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">characterizing how we can come to know</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.830" end="00:30:00.010" style="s2">ourselves engage in the processes of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:02.530" style="s2">transformation within he described it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.010" end="00:30:04.330" style="s2">me as cooking with being Anderson did</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.530" end="00:30:08.560" style="s2">and he also described alchemy in fact as</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.330" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">the art of transformation with that very</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.560" end="00:30:13.000" style="s2">very much in my opinion the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:14.770" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone can be thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">a symbol for self-organizing criticality</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.770" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">in that that&#39;s Wayne and I generally</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">approach it but everything else that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:26.290" style="s2">said ties in a lot with that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:28.870" style="s2">know the the process of what is a layer</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.290" end="00:30:30.970" style="s2">to gold right you know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:32.650" style="s2">virtual if you take an N transform it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.970" end="00:30:33.910" style="s2">a spiritual sense and yes it does very</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.650" end="00:30:35.920" style="s2">much speak to a personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.910" end="00:30:37.270" style="s2">where you&#39;re trying to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.920" end="00:30:42.040" style="s2">elements together in order to make a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.270" end="00:30:43.570" style="s2">great work yes I mean yes and then what</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.040" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">are those so we bring those elements</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.570" end="00:30:48.190" style="s2">together so that philosopher&#39;s stone is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:49.660" style="s2">a self-organizing criticality the self</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.190" end="00:30:51.280" style="s2">making criticality but then so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.660" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">fascinatingly like that the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.280" end="00:30:56.190" style="s2">between the internal and the external is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:30:58.180" style="s2">also blurred in this way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.190" end="00:31:00.730" style="s2">certainly from a perspective of process</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.180" end="00:31:02.740" style="s2">velocity its philosophy and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.730" end="00:31:06.970" style="s2">an or the Union depth psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.740" end="00:31:10.060" style="s2">approach we have this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.970" end="00:31:13.300" style="s2">council within the system within and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.060" end="00:31:15.970" style="s2">then the system without the council</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.300" end="00:31:19.160" style="s2">without so this self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.970" end="00:31:22.490" style="s2">criticality to me this</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.160" end="00:31:25.280" style="s2">this is properly seen as also in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.490" end="00:31:27.830" style="s2">relationship with the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.280" end="00:31:31.310" style="s2">criticality z&#39; of other people which</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.830" end="00:31:34.840" style="s2">themselves coagulate and differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.310" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">and integrate into systems which</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.840" end="00:31:40.850" style="s2">demonstrate the same kind of self making</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:42.770" style="s2">like have to demonstrate the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.850" end="00:31:46.460" style="s2">of self making behavior at least insofar</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.770" end="00:31:49.070" style="s2">as it enables any of things any of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.460" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">to continue so self how can we be self</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.070" end="00:31:55.720" style="s2">making together can you clarify what a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">self-organizing critical criticality is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.720" end="00:32:00.170" style="s2">well John spoke about that during key is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:03.250" style="s2">awaking from the meeting crisis the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.170" end="00:32:05.080" style="s2">lecture series in nature things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.250" end="00:32:08.530" style="s2">self-organizing which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.080" end="00:32:10.760" style="s2">fundamentally that like a tornado</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.530" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">self-organizing that the the processes</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.760" end="00:32:15.080" style="s2">that lead towards a tornado will</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:16.400" style="s2">reinforce the tornados existence so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.080" end="00:32:17.720" style="s2">it&#39;ll spin faster and faster and faster</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.400" end="00:32:19.580" style="s2">until it gets to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.720" end="00:32:22.460" style="s2">eventually entropy takes over in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.580" end="00:32:24.410" style="s2">entire system collapses natural systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.460" end="00:32:27.920" style="s2">follow that process very much where they</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.410" end="00:32:31.550" style="s2">and living systems especially follow</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.920" end="00:32:34.630" style="s2">that and I&#39;ve this research to show that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.550" end="00:32:36.910" style="s2">the brain actively seeks our</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.630" end="00:32:38.810" style="s2">self-organizing criticality where</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.910" end="00:32:41.060" style="s2">information the theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.810" end="00:32:42.860" style="s2">information processing maximizes on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.060" end="00:32:45.080" style="s2">on the line that is the border between</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.860" end="00:32:46.760" style="s2">order and chaos and so what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.080" end="00:32:50.390" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone here we would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.760" end="00:32:52.340" style="s2">signifying it is the border that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.390" end="00:32:53.870" style="s2">the on the line between order and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.340" end="00:32:57.530" style="s2">sorry the line that&#39;s on the border</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.870" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">between order and chaos and then so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.530" end="00:33:00.470" style="s2">way that I look at it from an alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:01.970" style="s2">perspective is it that the Philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.470" end="00:33:03.500" style="s2">Stone you&#39;re supposed to get the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.970" end="00:33:05.030" style="s2">philosopher&#39;s stone but the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.500" end="00:33:07.610" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone isn&#39;t the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.030" end="00:33:08.990" style="s2">the means and then so like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.610" end="00:33:10.520" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone is understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.990" end="00:33:11.480" style="s2">self-organizing criticality but then</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.520" end="00:33:13.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to take that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.480" end="00:33:14.260" style="s2">and apply it to the world and understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.250" end="00:33:16.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s all these other</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.260" end="00:33:18.350" style="s2">self-organizing criticality which you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:19.940" style="s2">have to interface with and so that to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.350" end="00:33:21.560" style="s2">is like what the what the whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.940" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">alchemists association with</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.560" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">self-organizing criticality would be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:27.650" style="s2">terms of trying to get the two languages</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:30.580" style="s2">to speak together the scientific and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.650" end="00:33:30.580" style="s2">psychological let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a nice articulation</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.140" end="00:33:42.920" style="s2">I have thought a few times in response</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:44.910" style="s2">to John speaking about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.920" end="00:33:47.670" style="s2">self-organizing criticality</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.910" end="00:33:49.850" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember exactly but I thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.670" end="00:33:51.870" style="s2">he differentiated between the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.850" end="00:33:55.280" style="s2">self-organizing and the self making in</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.870" end="00:33:58.800" style="s2">some sense so that a tornado doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.280" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">seek how the conditions of its own</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.800" end="00:34:05.610" style="s2">making yeah yeah the living system has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">governor which which which which seeks</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.610" end="00:34:10.950" style="s2">out to reinforce the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:13.619" style="s2">criticality and the tornado would lack</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.950" end="00:34:14.970" style="s2">that so it has yeah it&#39;s only while the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.619" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">environment enforces the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.970" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">self-organizing criticality is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">tornado continues to spin but the living</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.570" style="s2">organism has something above that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:23.419" style="s2">because it actually actively tries to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.570" end="00:34:25.590" style="s2">prevent what or tries to intercede</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.419" end="00:34:27.240" style="s2">against environmental patterns which</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.590" end="00:34:29.310" style="s2">would disrupt the the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.240" end="00:34:31.590" style="s2">criticality and I think John argues that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.310" end="00:34:33.780" style="s2">parasitic processing is largely a result</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.590" end="00:34:36.179" style="s2">of the self-organizing criticality</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.780" end="00:34:40.169" style="s2">attempting to keep the environment at</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.179" end="00:34:42.179" style="s2">bay in this way hmm yeah that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.169" end="00:34:44.520" style="s2">very helpful so a key a key</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.179" end="00:34:45.570" style="s2">differentiating feature then to use some</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.520" end="00:34:47.550" style="s2">of the language that I&#39;ve just brought</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.570" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">in in this conversation would be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.550" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">self making process is actually capable</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:59.550" style="s2">of creating new games it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:35:02.850" style="s2">degree with that yeah and that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.550" end="00:35:07.670" style="s2">sort of take me to where like mostly</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.850" end="00:35:11.670" style="s2">where I&#39;m at at the moment is how can we</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.670" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">make new games together yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.670" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">would say that that&#39;s the 11 the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.100" style="s2">creativity and the ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:20.940" style="s2">choices that that&#39;s where it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.100" end="00:35:22.280" style="s2">from right yeah yeah yeah exactly so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.940" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">have to kind there&#39;s a kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.280" end="00:35:29.300" style="s2">baseline what&#39;s the minimal viable but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">neces what other kind of necessary I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.300" end="00:35:33.570" style="s2">mean to speak of sufficiency is also to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:35.700" style="s2">speak of kind of like if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.570" end="00:35:37.080" style="s2">have the actuation potential to get up</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.700" end="00:35:38.280" style="s2">off our backsides and be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.080" end="00:35:40.200" style="s2">anything it also may be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.280" end="00:35:42.540" style="s2">there&#39;s another couple things but what</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.200" end="00:35:43.810" style="s2">are kind of the core necessary features</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.540" end="00:35:47.100" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.810" end="00:35:50.260" style="s2">characterizes the right relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.100" end="00:35:52.690" style="s2">coming into like building games with</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.260" end="00:35:56.110" style="s2">other players so dignifying the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.690" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">player like capacity and others so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.110" end="00:35:59.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of dignity there and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">got to be an integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.050" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">communication channel and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:07.570" style="s2">kind of directionality as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">tell which I think of something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.570" end="00:36:12.220" style="s2">forest talks about life lived well and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.630" style="s2">fully and it&#39;s just obviously could mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.220" end="00:36:16.570" style="s2">a lot of different things by that but a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.630" end="00:36:18.220" style="s2">kind of a directionality of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.570" end="00:36:19.720" style="s2">flourishing development although the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.220" end="00:36:21.070" style="s2">word flourishing I sometimes tend to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.720" end="00:36:23.170" style="s2">stay away from but that&#39;s probably just</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.070" end="00:36:25.540" style="s2">due to city bias reasons and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.170" end="00:36:27.250" style="s2">frustration with sam Harris a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.540" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">even though I do respect him as a person</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.250" end="00:36:36.630" style="s2">um but yeah how do we what are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.790" end="00:36:38.890" style="s2">the minimal viable virtues axioms that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.630" end="00:36:43.090" style="s2">enable the right relationship of game</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.890" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">making together seems to be a very ripe</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.090" end="00:36:48.220" style="s2">inquiry than what you think about that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:51.010" style="s2">think that that sounded to me just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.220" end="00:36:52.330" style="s2">the application form to the religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.010" end="00:36:54.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a religion section of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.330" end="00:36:55.660" style="s2">server it sounds like you&#39;ve got to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.280" end="00:36:57.490" style="s2">and I think that you should not to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.660" end="00:36:58.660" style="s2">part of that conversation because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.490" end="00:37:01.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.660" end="00:37:06.940" style="s2">interested in as well yeah awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.800" end="00:37:09.790" style="s2">yeah cool well I mean yeah so I I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:11.110" style="s2">like to be part of that conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.790" end="00:37:12.580" style="s2">can talk about we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.110" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">afterwards if you like it would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.580" end="00:37:19.720" style="s2">come down a little bit to a kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.130" style="s2">actually a rational structuring of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.720" end="00:37:22.660" style="s2">of our energies fundamentally which</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.130" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">would be to engage in the discussion a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.660" end="00:37:26.100" style="s2">lot of it is where to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">discussion and I&#39;m also trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.100" end="00:37:30.670" style="s2">yeah well we&#39;ve designed documents and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:32.350" style="s2">kind of everything at the moment so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.670" end="00:37:35.410" style="s2">mean yeah those questions are exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.350" end="00:37:36.730" style="s2">the right questions I think yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.410" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">beautiful all right then well we can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.730" end="00:37:41.260" style="s2">can pick this back up we can pick this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:43.480" style="s2">back up yeah Tim I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.260" end="00:37:45.400" style="s2">just me but I&#39;m not seeing your video</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.480" end="00:37:48.090" style="s2">maybe you could click it on and off or</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.400" end="00:37:49.300" style="s2">is it just me can other people saw your</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.090" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.300" end="00:37:53.710" style="s2">I think I&#39;m fine so maybe it&#39;s just me a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.920" style="s2">little choppy I can say it might just be</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.710" end="00:37:58.690" style="s2">you and I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.920" end="00:38:01.510" style="s2">all right so some of us my video is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.690" end="00:38:02.770" style="s2">definitely alright okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.510" end="00:38:08.860" style="s2">try turning it off and on let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.770" end="00:38:09.130" style="s2">look sure see if oh yeah I can see you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.860" end="00:38:13.780" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.130" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">great all right Lord dr. doom you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.780" end="00:38:19.420" style="s2">hopefully not - doom full question</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">whoo-hoo maybe I should have come up</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.420" end="00:38:26.190" style="s2">with a tuneful one no I I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:28.840" style="s2">ask you in your study of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.190" end="00:38:32.080" style="s2">what&#39;s your favorite existential idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.840" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">from a playful perspective like an</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.080" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">integrating into the beam mode and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">the same question but for John&#39;s work so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:41.020" style="s2">what&#39;s your favorite existential idea in</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:46.920" style="s2">general and what&#39;s your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.020" end="00:38:52.900" style="s2">existential idea from John&#39;s work mmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.920" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">favorite existential idea so an example</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.900" end="00:38:58.600" style="s2">would be like agape or it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:39:00.730" style="s2">into the loving state where you afford</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.600" end="00:39:02.350" style="s2">the other that&#39;s a possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.730" end="00:39:05.050" style="s2">growth in a positive direction like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.350" end="00:39:10.360" style="s2">would be an existential idea all right</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.050" end="00:39:14.980" style="s2">well then non John&#39;s work one so Sartre</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.360" end="00:39:19.720" style="s2">said existence precedes essence meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.980" end="00:39:21.490" style="s2">that we have to make our meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.720" end="00:39:25.830" style="s2">fundamentally right there&#39;s not anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.490" end="00:39:33.580" style="s2">like prescribed in our beingness itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.830" end="00:39:37.930" style="s2">which is it&#39;s like there for us already</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.580" end="00:39:39.790" style="s2">and I this is not one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.930" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">ideas I don&#39;t I don&#39;t agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.790" end="00:39:47.890" style="s2">precisely but it&#39;s playful</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:49.810" style="s2">because I remember just consistently</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.890" end="00:39:51.390" style="s2">thinking about this our existence</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.810" end="00:39:58.660" style="s2">precedes essence over the essence</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.390" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">precedes existence how do we but the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.660" end="00:40:07.860" style="s2">the playfulness is in the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:07.860" style="s2">kind of act of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">being itself and we seem to we take in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.410" end="00:40:19.730" style="s2">perception and then we spin it around</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:21.380" style="s2">and we come out with expression and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.730" end="00:40:28.130" style="s2">we&#39;re consistently undergoing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.380" end="00:40:35.510" style="s2">process and so it&#39;s a kind of rejection</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.130" end="00:40:38.840" style="s2">of the fixed frame of reference as being</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.510" end="00:40:43.190" style="s2">able to appropriately characterize</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.840" end="00:40:47.020" style="s2">meaning at all so such it would be about</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.190" end="00:40:50.510" style="s2">then you know how do we respond to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.020" end="00:40:56.450" style="s2">thrown us that we find ourselves in kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.510" end="00:40:59.030" style="s2">of unmoored from a proscribed meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.450" end="00:41:02.180" style="s2">life and we have to go out and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.030" end="00:41:03.170" style="s2">make it I mean it&#39;s been a while since</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.180" end="00:41:05.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve read this stuff I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.170" end="00:41:07.880" style="s2">butchering it but but actually our</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.570" end="00:41:10.010" style="s2">capacity to make you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.880" end="00:41:12.970" style="s2">our capacity to make and to show up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.010" end="00:41:17.300" style="s2">to engage in anything at all is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.970" end="00:41:20.810" style="s2">indicative of a capacity to do just that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.300" end="00:41:24.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s never been anything but that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.810" end="00:41:28.280" style="s2">but that is not a reduction of it away</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.290" end="00:41:31.910" style="s2">it&#39;s contemplating it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.280" end="00:41:33.710" style="s2">set of axioms that is much more fluent</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.910" end="00:41:35.750" style="s2">with a process type thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.710" end="00:41:38.570" style="s2">understanding ourselves as embedded</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.750" end="00:41:40.850" style="s2">relations within imbedded relations that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.570" end="00:41:45.950" style="s2">are nevertheless influential on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.850" end="00:41:48.110" style="s2">flow so we&#39;re involved in our</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.950" end="00:41:51.080" style="s2">meaning-making and that is a real</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.110" end="00:41:52.820" style="s2">relationship you know in the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.080" end="00:42:00.620" style="s2">but it&#39;s a real relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.820" end="00:42:02.570" style="s2">world so in terms of John&#39;s work in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.620" end="00:42:05.810" style="s2">terms of existential ideas of John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.570" end="00:42:09.050" style="s2">work it&#39;s hard because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.810" end="00:42:11.120" style="s2">of the architecture of his teaching that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.050" end="00:42:13.310" style="s2">has been so influential on me I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.120" end="00:42:16.120" style="s2">know exactly where to pick out one</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.310" end="00:42:16.120" style="s2">particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.020" end="00:42:29.310" style="s2">it&#39;s what I&#39;m about to say is altogether</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.600" end="00:42:32.550" style="s2">too sweet but what what John embodies</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.310" end="00:42:40.740" style="s2">and enacts in his way of dialoguing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.550" end="00:42:42.660" style="s2">people is exemplary of a kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.740" end="00:42:44.760" style="s2">than an existential idea because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.660" end="00:42:46.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an idea and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.760" end="00:42:49.140" style="s2">proposition of space it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.790" end="00:42:52.340" style="s2">coming into relation with people which</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.140" end="00:42:55.860" style="s2">is you know he has a lot to teach and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.340" end="00:42:58.020" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate that we listen to him</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.860" end="00:42:59.700" style="s2">if we want to learn about things he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.020" end="00:43:01.260" style="s2">learned about obviously because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.700" end="00:43:02.670" style="s2">have that learning necessarily and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.260" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">once we do have it we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.670" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">other things but he has a way of I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.830" end="00:43:18.680" style="s2">opening up dialogue and being receptive</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:21.540" style="s2">to other perspectives while teaching</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.680" end="00:43:25.830" style="s2">framing the conversation teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.540" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">also maneuvering it in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.830" end="00:43:31.340" style="s2">think is very positive</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">as far as interaction on the public</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.340" end="00:43:40.470" style="s2">stage goes and that seems to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:42.030" style="s2">very existentially important thing what</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.470" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">would be the existential idea in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.030" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2">that we&#39;re all involved right</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">that we actually all do matter</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:48.090" style="s2">and that we have to speak to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:53.100" style="s2">other&#39;s virtues we have to we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.090" end="00:43:54.650" style="s2">resonate with each other&#39;s dignity you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.100" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.650" end="00:44:04.230" style="s2">that we are all involved in coupling</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">processes with reality and with each</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.230" end="00:44:11.310" style="s2">other and that&#39;s deeply life-affirming</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">to me you know there&#39;s other ways to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.310" end="00:44:15.660" style="s2">at these ideas I don&#39;t think precisely</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">that sense is you know I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.660" end="00:44:21.030" style="s2">think I learned that from John but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:26.360" style="s2">think his exemplification of that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.030" end="00:44:28.680" style="s2">dialog is deeply important given the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.360" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">lack of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.680" end="00:44:34.910" style="s2">that in much public discussion around</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:37.170" style="s2">topics as important as you know God</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.910" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">sacredness and the meaning of life I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.170" end="00:44:40.730" style="s2">hope that wasn&#39;t a cop-out question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:42.599" style="s2">not good at picking out particular ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.730" end="00:44:46.140" style="s2">located that was brilliant thank you</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.599" end="00:44:49.530" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna skip ahead a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.140" end="00:44:51.569" style="s2">I know Lorene has uh has her own meeting</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.530" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">starting in a few minutes with authentic</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.569" end="00:44:57.510" style="s2">relating games Loreen you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:45:01.140" style="s2">hi Thank You Brett my team it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.510" end="00:45:06.089" style="s2">see you also here in the I&#39;ve joined him</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.140" end="00:45:08.339" style="s2">in voice after crafting so so what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.089" end="00:45:11.550" style="s2">wanted to ask is that what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.339" end="00:45:14.970" style="s2">is there this role of games when it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.550" end="00:45:17.160" style="s2">comes to the art of transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.970" end="00:45:18.780" style="s2">what is this game design or if you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.160" end="00:45:24.690" style="s2">say that in a metaphor what does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.780" end="00:45:27.210" style="s2">look like well if we put a tiny child</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.690" end="00:45:28.980" style="s2">out in a professional rugby pitch that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.210" end="00:45:31.559" style="s2">child is not going to have a good time</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.980" end="00:45:33.690" style="s2">and even though ostensibly that child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.559" end="00:45:36.059" style="s2">being put out in a game he&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.690" end="00:45:37.859" style="s2">playing that game right it&#39;s just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.059" end="00:45:39.420" style="s2">get trampled and it&#39;s not going to learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.859" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be all together a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.420" end="00:45:51.390" style="s2">tragic thing so we learn through playing</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:46:00.140" style="s2">games ie I think those environments</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.390" end="00:46:03.809" style="s2">where the curious playful spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.140" end="00:46:06.329" style="s2">actually able to explore and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.809" end="00:46:09.450" style="s2">receive feedback in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.329" end="00:46:15.329" style="s2">end all possibility of further feedback</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.450" end="00:46:22.410" style="s2">right like how can we come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.329" end="00:46:25.319" style="s2">what is in our zone of agency unless we</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.410" end="00:46:27.240" style="s2">come up to the edge of where that is you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.319" end="00:46:29.730" style="s2">know like when you&#39;re bundling or</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.730" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">or your parents when you&#39;re really young</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.619" end="00:46:35.790" style="s2">kind of figuring out what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.309" style="s2">appropriate to touch and how hard to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.790" end="00:46:39.420" style="s2">pull and all the rest of it and through</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.309" end="00:46:42.089" style="s2">that process you come to an</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.420" end="00:46:42.530" style="s2">understanding of what the others like</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.089" end="00:46:44.870" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.530" end="00:46:46.850" style="s2">also what effects you have and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.850" end="00:46:54.170" style="s2">that the process of learning can</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.440" end="00:46:59.570" style="s2">continue so the importance of making</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.170" end="00:47:03.590" style="s2">games is is critical because games are</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.570" end="00:47:10.760" style="s2">the environments where we get to test</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.590" end="00:47:15.560" style="s2">ourselves extend ourselves play and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.760" end="00:47:18.350" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s got to be something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.560" end="00:47:22.340" style="s2">more interesting I can add to that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.350" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">where serious play comes in yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.340" end="00:47:29.990" style="s2">serious play for sure I mean it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:39.800" style="s2">you know the serious serious players is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.990" end="00:47:41.090" style="s2">I suppose how how enabled so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.800" end="00:47:48.440" style="s2">to have so the serious play is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.090" end="00:47:50.030" style="s2">taking place in a setting right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.440" end="00:47:51.650" style="s2">it&#39;s these things have to happen all at</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.030" end="00:47:53.540" style="s2">once which is kind of why I&#39;m struggling</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.650" end="00:47:55.550" style="s2">to talk about it right now because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.540" end="00:47:59.900" style="s2">talking about making games and playing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.550" end="00:48:05.510" style="s2">games well and we have to play our way</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.900" end="00:48:07.550" style="s2">to making the games but we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.510" end="00:48:09.260" style="s2">something that&#39;s quite different from</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.550" end="00:48:10.970" style="s2">ordinary game playing that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.260" end="00:48:13.670" style="s2">been set out because what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.970" end="00:48:16.780" style="s2">looking to push the boundaries of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.670" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">whole set of different games</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.780" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2">interactions styles like maybe I could</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">give an example of how I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.600" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">about what kind of games I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">see played in a way that invited</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:35.780" style="s2">actually viewing of them in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">that we currently have so not that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.780" end="00:48:41.450" style="s2">want to continue this spectacle of kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:44.780" style="s2">of passive absorption of information</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.450" end="00:48:49.180" style="s2">without a deeper kind of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.780" end="00:48:52.280" style="s2">sense of mattering to that process but</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.180" end="00:48:54.980" style="s2">what we see for example in the game of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.280" end="00:48:55.789" style="s2">politics is a whole bunch of pretence on</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.980" end="00:48:59.029" style="s2">the outside</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.789" end="00:49:01.099" style="s2">and then kind of inner workings on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.029" end="00:49:03.289" style="s2">inside where the real games are being</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.099" end="00:49:05.869" style="s2">played regarding the manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.289" end="00:49:07.969" style="s2">power and who&#39;s getting what and how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.869" end="00:49:09.439" style="s2">balance my resources fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.969" end="00:49:11.719" style="s2">within games that we&#39;re not telling you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.439" end="00:49:13.880" style="s2">about so there&#39;s a kind of we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.719" end="00:49:17.479" style="s2">outside of a bunch of games but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.880" end="00:49:19.939" style="s2">playing a game through voting and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.479" end="00:49:22.309" style="s2">through like not rebelling and only</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.939" end="00:49:24.949" style="s2">rioting so much or accepting more or</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.309" end="00:49:29.199" style="s2">less the prescriptions that come down to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.949" end="00:49:33.609" style="s2">us but there&#39;s a disconnect in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.199" end="00:49:36.679" style="s2">authenticity there&#39;s a disconnect in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.609" end="00:49:40.039" style="s2">trust of the right relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.679" end="00:49:45.919" style="s2">all of these things so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.039" end="00:49:48.529" style="s2">interested in creating a space that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.919" end="00:49:52.509" style="s2">know a bit like a bit like this in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.529" end="00:49:56.989" style="s2">you know the questions being asked are</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.509" end="00:49:58.399" style="s2">real serious deep questions and either I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.989" end="00:50:02.689" style="s2">have something interesting to say about</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.399" end="00:50:06.099" style="s2">it or I don&#39;t and that whole process is</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.689" end="00:50:10.459" style="s2">going to be played out right before you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.099" end="00:50:18.109" style="s2">so the kind of games I&#39;m interested to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.459" end="00:50:23.630" style="s2">see are ones where the absolute fullness</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.109" end="00:50:26.059" style="s2">of the perceptual matrix of self of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.630" end="00:50:28.669" style="s2">particular individual which is a term</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.059" end="00:50:31.449" style="s2">from Forrest Landry&#39;s work the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.669" end="00:50:35.319" style="s2">fullness of an individual&#39;s perception</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.449" end="00:50:39.619" style="s2">can be cooled it can be cooled upon and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.319" end="00:50:40.579" style="s2">offered in relationship in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.619" end="00:50:45.949" style="s2">game space</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.579" end="00:50:50.869" style="s2">so in some sense anything I have to give</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.949" end="00:50:52.729" style="s2">that&#39;s valuable I can offer it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.869" end="00:50:56.569" style="s2">what&#39;s required in order for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.729" end="00:50:58.339" style="s2">offering to be what&#39;s required in order</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.569" end="00:50:59.929" style="s2">for it be set to be safe enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.339" end="00:51:03.799" style="s2">to offer that in some sense it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.929" end="00:51:05.599" style="s2">going to be a risk but you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.799" end="00:51:07.849" style="s2">ultimately we&#39;re offering things like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.599" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">the commitment of our person you knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.849" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">where this aspirin</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:15.380" style="s2">you know making a commitment to being</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:15.380" style="s2">here and showing up in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.499" end="00:51:22.920" style="s2">basically these are games to play it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.299" end="00:51:24.569" style="s2">commitment to game making over a long</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.920" end="00:51:27.630" style="s2">period of time at the kind of games I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.569" end="00:51:31.619" style="s2">interested to see where we where we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.630" end="00:51:32.220" style="s2">people entering into covenants with one</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.619" end="00:51:38.029" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.220" end="00:51:38.029" style="s2">covenants together where we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.779" end="00:51:45.859" style="s2">committing to offer the fullness of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.430" end="00:51:49.259" style="s2">we can given the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.859" end="00:51:56.339" style="s2">relationship is maintained such that our</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.259" end="00:51:57.990" style="s2">giving continues to be appropriate this</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.339" end="00:51:59.700" style="s2">is all quite abstract it&#39;s it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.990" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s such a difficult one because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.700" end="00:52:03.599" style="s2">making the games at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:06.299" style="s2">playing them well whatever they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.599" end="00:52:11.130" style="s2">Carter one of the things we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.299" end="00:52:13.140" style="s2">interested on this forum is the creation</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.130" end="00:52:15.989" style="s2">of new series play games of new rituals</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.140" end="00:52:17.249" style="s2">you know to go along with the religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.989" end="00:52:20.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion or the wakening</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.249" end="00:52:22.259" style="s2">from the meeting crisis and and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.039" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">gonna be forming a committee soon to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.259" end="00:52:29.009" style="s2">really you know start really continue</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">working on these because we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.009" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">already started so so your input would</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:38.609" style="s2">would certainly be very welcome there as</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:41.099" style="s2">we continue to experiment in this have</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.609" end="00:52:44.339" style="s2">you heard of the gossiping only because</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.099" end="00:52:49.769" style="s2">somebody posted about it on the for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.339" end="00:52:53.489" style="s2">yeah LCC yeah so the person who posted</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.769" end="00:52:58.019" style="s2">about that I&#39;ve played a few glass bead</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.489" end="00:53:02.519" style="s2">games with them and we sort of we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.019" end="00:53:04.769" style="s2">committed to do so regularly and I find</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.519" end="00:53:08.849" style="s2">them really awesome in many ways they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.769" end="00:53:11.940" style="s2">are akin to what is already achievable</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.849" end="00:53:13.589" style="s2">in conversation itself but they provide</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.940" end="00:53:16.609" style="s2">a bit of structure so the idea with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.589" end="00:53:19.799" style="s2">glass speed gamers LCC has created it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.609" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">that you can take either one two three</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.799" end="00:53:22.920" style="s2">or five minute turns or longer turns you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:26.519" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.920" end="00:53:30.059" style="s2">begin with one where for a minute one</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.519" end="00:53:34.289" style="s2">essentially under got liked as of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.059" end="00:53:36.779" style="s2">verbal contemplation relating to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.289" end="00:53:39.630" style="s2">particular theme or bead and he&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.779" end="00:53:45.240" style="s2">up with a bunch so one might be game one</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.630" end="00:53:48.200" style="s2">might be the gift one might be love</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.240" end="00:53:53.430" style="s2">right there&#39;s a and there&#39;s a chosen in</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.200" end="00:53:57.049" style="s2">particular ways and we sort of trade</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.430" end="00:54:00.029" style="s2">back and forth a flow of extemporaneous</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.049" end="00:54:06.019" style="s2">contemplation about that particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.029" end="00:54:10.859" style="s2">concept and the idea is to merge with</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.019" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">the expression of the other not deny</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.859" end="00:54:14.849" style="s2">one&#39;s own critical reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:18.299" style="s2">reflectivities of it but to really</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.849" end="00:54:20.430" style="s2">deeply listen to it and then take on</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.299" end="00:54:21.990" style="s2">those themes and build them into one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.430" end="00:54:26.910" style="s2">own expression and explore these</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.990" end="00:54:28.650" style="s2">concepts so this is a kind of practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.910" end="00:54:32.609" style="s2">that I personally find really</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.650" end="00:54:33.690" style="s2">interesting and might be something worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.609" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">looking into</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.690" end="00:54:38.730" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a website for it as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:41.849" style="s2">glass bead game I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.079" end="00:55:14.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking into the creation that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.250" end="00:55:16.740" style="s2">I think over the years around</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.210" end="00:55:19.109" style="s2">transformation and so there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.740" end="00:55:22.500" style="s2">of problems tied up in my opinion with</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.109" end="00:55:24.660" style="s2">using transformation as you sort I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.500" end="00:55:27.059" style="s2">you sort of alluded to this earlier when</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.660" end="00:55:29.789" style="s2">talking about it there we seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.059" end="00:55:36.140" style="s2">using one word for a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.789" end="00:55:39.420" style="s2">methods or strategies or events</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.140" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">that we refer to its transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.420" end="00:55:43.590" style="s2">what might be just the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:46.770" style="s2">over time and you know you could say</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.590" end="00:55:50.250" style="s2">look if you do nothing entropy if you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.770" end="00:55:54.660" style="s2">something risk right and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.250" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">that&#39;s non-negotiable but the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.660" end="00:56:01.650" style="s2">interesting form of transformation for</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:04.200" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to explore are these</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.650" end="00:56:06.660" style="s2">so-called transformative experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.200" end="00:56:09.630" style="s2">they can happen a number of ways and one</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.660" end="00:56:12.870" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve been sort of asking</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.630" end="00:56:16.850" style="s2">John about is you know in meditation you</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.870" end="00:56:19.110" style="s2">can you can hit these transformative</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.850" end="00:56:21.390" style="s2">experiences within the meditation that</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.110" end="00:56:26.070" style="s2">cause sort of these second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.390" end="00:56:28.440" style="s2">that people notice right but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.070" end="00:56:30.390" style="s2">necessarily integrate back into your</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.440" end="00:56:31.980" style="s2">life and I think the same is true with</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.390" end="00:56:34.020" style="s2">with taking psychedelics you take a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.980" end="00:56:37.050" style="s2">psychedelic have a good trip have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.020" end="00:56:39.510" style="s2">transformative trip and yet they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.050" end="00:56:41.250" style="s2">same person afterwards except for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.510" end="00:56:44.340" style="s2">reference to that one time they had the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.250" end="00:56:46.050" style="s2">transformative experience and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.340" end="00:56:47.550" style="s2">two problems wrapped up here one is well</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.050" end="00:56:49.590" style="s2">what what do we actually call that right</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.550" end="00:56:51.330" style="s2">because it seems like we need three or</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.590" end="00:56:54.330" style="s2">four words for different types of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.330" end="00:56:55.560" style="s2">transformation but and and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.330" end="00:56:56.910" style="s2">you have a comment on that that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.560" end="00:56:59.010" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t that&#39;s fine too because</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.910" end="00:57:01.800" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a hard thing to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.010" end="00:57:03.300" style="s2">suss out but more importantly you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.800" end="00:57:06.090" style="s2">what do we do with the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.300" end="00:57:08.270" style="s2">that we have especially the sudden or I</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.090" end="00:57:09.810" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say sudden the the grand</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.270" end="00:57:11.700" style="s2">transformations right those</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.810" end="00:57:13.980" style="s2">transformations where where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.700" end="00:57:18.420" style="s2">touching the ineffable right where you</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.980" end="00:57:19.310" style="s2">see you have a site or an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.420" end="00:57:21.300" style="s2">the divine</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.310" end="00:57:23.580" style="s2">and-and-and and then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.300" end="00:57:26.010" style="s2">integrate that like what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.580" end="00:57:27.510" style="s2">need to do because I think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.010" end="00:57:29.670" style="s2">right conception although I&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.510" end="00:57:33.030" style="s2">prepared to be wrong I think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.670" end="00:57:37.290" style="s2">cede the ground so that when and if that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.030" end="00:57:39.650" style="s2">happens it integrates and changes you</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.290" end="00:57:41.630" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just about the quote</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.650" end="00:57:45.000" style="s2">transformation it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.630" end="00:57:46.980" style="s2">transformations effect through time into</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.000" end="00:57:48.690" style="s2">the current time because that there</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.980" end="00:57:49.860" style="s2">seems to be a difference there and again</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.690" end="00:57:54.420" style="s2">maybe this is wrapped up in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.860" end="00:57:56.580" style="s2">it&#39;s just like no I had any temporal</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.420" end="00:57:58.170" style="s2">experience right that it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.580" end="00:57:59.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go outside the window and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.170" end="00:58:02.220" style="s2">these other things that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.460" end="00:58:03.840" style="s2">about are actually sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.220" end="00:58:06.270" style="s2">transformative right where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.840" end="00:58:07.830" style="s2">changed me in some sense so I just</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.270" end="00:58:09.780" style="s2">wanted to get your feel for that because</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.830" end="00:58:11.850" style="s2">I think that you might actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.780" end="00:58:15.090" style="s2">lot of a lot to say on that that would</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.850" end="00:58:17.370" style="s2">be helpful to me yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.090" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">awesome questions I do have a lot to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.370" end="00:58:21.780" style="s2">on it I mean I just like to preface this</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">everyone listening I&#39;m sorry if this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.780" end="00:58:27.540" style="s2">not that coherent but I do think I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:30.270" style="s2">say some things I mean sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.540" end="00:58:31.800" style="s2">you&#39;re referencing is very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.270" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve discussed so far and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.800" end="00:58:36.540" style="s2">speaks to this relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:40.410" style="s2">player and the game</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.540" end="00:58:42.630" style="s2">you know you can have a you can take a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.410" end="00:58:46.080" style="s2">win you can look through a window you</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.630" end="00:58:49.860" style="s2">can feel a different way of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.080" end="00:58:54.030" style="s2">world for a short space of time and come</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.860" end="00:58:56.490" style="s2">back as it were to ordinary life and all</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.030" end="00:58:58.620" style="s2">the conditions that you are functioning</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.490" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">in before are basically the same the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.620" end="00:59:03.270" style="s2">games that you find yourself in all</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:06.680" style="s2">those stimulus-response relationships</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.270" end="00:59:08.670" style="s2">you know the shared landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.680" end="00:59:10.320" style="s2">expectation that you shared with all</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.670" end="00:59:12.510" style="s2">your social relations and that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.320" end="00:59:14.670" style="s2">build into your own environment the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.510" end="00:59:17.190" style="s2">your objects in your house are arranged</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.670" end="00:59:19.290" style="s2">the activities you&#39;re doing at work you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.190" end="00:59:21.420" style="s2">travel back and forth all these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.290" end="00:59:25.350" style="s2">of behavior remain exactly the same and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.420" end="00:59:29.430" style="s2">those patterns of behavior are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.350" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">I mean that is ones you have to be you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.430" end="00:59:35.550" style="s2">be your way there right you you make</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:38.670" style="s2">them real again when you go and undergo</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.550" end="00:59:41.880" style="s2">those patterns now there might be a real</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.670" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">sense of dissonance one has when one</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.880" end="00:59:48.630" style="s2">returns to the life one had before given</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:50.700" style="s2">this other experience one had seen one I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.630" end="00:59:55.830" style="s2">like peeked behind the veil so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.700" end="00:59:59.300" style="s2">and maybe contemplated and saw into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.830" end="01:00:02.190" style="s2">arbitrariness of ways people were living</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.300" end="01:00:03.069" style="s2">patterns of action people were engaging</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.190" end="01:00:05.170" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.069" end="01:00:07.239" style="s2">and what do you do with that what do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.170" end="01:00:08.680" style="s2">do with that is the question well the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.239" end="01:00:10.329" style="s2">issue is that we of course social</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.680" end="01:00:11.709" style="s2">creatures you know Jordan who likes to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.329" end="01:00:15.900" style="s2">say with the expression we&#39;re obligate</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.709" end="01:00:20.349" style="s2">tribal and when we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.900" end="01:00:21.579" style="s2">transformation through you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.349" end="01:00:24.130" style="s2">alchemical part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.579" end="01:00:28.059" style="s2">coming into self making or</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.130" end="01:00:30.039" style="s2">self-organizing criticality within well</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.059" end="01:00:33.430" style="s2">we&#39;re engaged in those processes without</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.039" end="01:00:36.130" style="s2">as well and if the environment doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.430" end="01:00:41.069" style="s2">continue to afford an integration of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.130" end="01:00:44.199" style="s2">that way of seeing into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.069" end="01:00:45.279" style="s2">relationality you have with yourself and</p>

<p begin="01:00:45.279" end="01:00:47.890" style="s2">itself well then there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.630" end="01:00:51.910" style="s2">straight-up dissonance there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.890" end="01:00:54.989" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty clear that lots of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.910" end="01:00:58.029" style="s2">people have experiences which if they</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.989" end="01:01:00.519" style="s2">could have them in communities and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.029" end="01:01:04.569" style="s2">embedded in in environments which</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.519" end="01:01:10.410" style="s2">enabled their continued integration of</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.569" end="01:01:15.459" style="s2">some of that experience would help to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.410" end="01:01:16.979" style="s2">embed that microcosm of transformative</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.459" end="01:01:23.650" style="s2">moment you know you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.979" end="01:01:24.910" style="s2">into healthier macrocosm and that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.650" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">know that&#39;s not to say anything unique</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.910" end="01:01:29.619" style="s2">at all right like it&#39;s integration</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:31.420" style="s2">considered over time given we&#39;re social</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.619" end="01:01:32.949" style="s2">creatures always in relationship as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.420" end="01:01:35.079" style="s2">more than social we&#39;re ecological</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.949" end="01:01:39.489" style="s2">creatures right we&#39;re deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.079" end="01:01:42.729" style="s2">in the world around us so the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.489" end="01:01:45.249" style="s2">we have is to and of course this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.729" end="01:01:47.109" style="s2">something as community is is vectoring</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.249" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">towards doing and it&#39;s doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.109" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like how can we create the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:58.089" style="s2">environments the games as well that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:02:00.099" style="s2">can begin to work with some of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.089" end="01:02:03.009" style="s2">experiences we have some of the ways of</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.099" end="01:02:05.859" style="s2">feeling and being we realized as</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.009" end="01:02:08.650" style="s2">possible in certain peak States how can</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.859" end="01:02:13.180" style="s2">we bring them into relationship such</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.650" end="01:02:15.640" style="s2">that they are what&#39;s seen valued heard</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.640" end="01:02:23.140" style="s2">enter into a kind of a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.930" end="01:02:26.710" style="s2">construction type relationship with with</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.140" end="01:02:30.070" style="s2">the world so you know it&#39;s all well and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.710" end="01:02:34.390" style="s2">good to have a kind of non-dual type</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.070" end="01:02:38.920" style="s2">experience of seeing the seeing in and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.390" end="01:02:41.710" style="s2">out through everything but if one comes</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.920" end="01:02:44.680" style="s2">back to you know a screaming household</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.710" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">where the state of play had been to</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.680" end="01:02:50.740" style="s2">basically just project onto one another</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:53.500" style="s2">all the various inner maladies and</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.740" end="01:02:55.800" style="s2">frustrations with life one had had you</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.500" end="01:02:59.050" style="s2">know not least of which are due to a</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.800" end="01:03:01.030" style="s2">sick game that we&#39;re all nested inside</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.050" end="01:03:02.020" style="s2">of or sick games were nested inside of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.030" end="01:03:03.400" style="s2">then there&#39;s going to be bloody</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.020" end="01:03:08.970" style="s2">dissonance isn&#39;t it&#39;s not it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.400" end="01:03:11.770" style="s2">bloody easy so you know the trick is to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.970" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">fundamentally create if you have no</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.770" end="01:03:17.500" style="s2">option well if you have no option that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.090" style="s2">almost like a strange thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.500" end="01:03:21.870" style="s2">because I think fundamentally we</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.090" end="01:03:25.080" style="s2">actually do always have an option but</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.870" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">say we&#39;ve got at least the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.080" end="01:03:31.300" style="s2">carve out a little bit of space and time</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:36.570" style="s2">for ourselves to be in such that we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.300" end="01:03:40.840" style="s2">begin to express in a way that channeled</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.570" end="01:03:44.140" style="s2">that perception we had that being we</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.840" end="01:03:47.170" style="s2">were able to take part in and realize</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.140" end="01:03:52.540" style="s2">ourselves as living if we can channel</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.170" end="01:03:58.540" style="s2">that into expression that is seeking a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.540" end="01:04:02.500" style="s2">kind of a relay is a key way the word</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.540" end="01:04:04.810" style="s2">humility is coming to me how can we both</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:06.730" style="s2">with courage and care for the process</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.810" end="01:04:08.170" style="s2">and those things together kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.730" end="01:04:09.850" style="s2">minuite it&#39;s no point being courageous</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.170" end="01:04:11.320" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a humility because</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.850" end="01:04:13.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna charge off and get</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.320" end="01:04:14.620" style="s2">yourself done in immediately so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.240" end="01:04:16.330" style="s2">what do I actually have to give here</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.620" end="01:04:17.860" style="s2">what can I manage to do where&#39;s my zone</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.330" end="01:04:20.890" style="s2">of proximal development where&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.860" end="01:04:22.690" style="s2">risk I can take that&#39;s appropriate but a</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.890" end="01:04:25.840" style="s2">caring for that process obviously over a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.690" end="01:04:28.990" style="s2">longer period of time how can I begin to</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.840" end="01:04:33.099" style="s2">express and create for myself</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.990" end="01:04:35.109" style="s2">an outlet and a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.099" end="01:04:37.539" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve manifested into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.109" end="01:04:40.869" style="s2">world which is like my own little portal</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.539" end="01:04:43.539" style="s2">through which to begin to enter into</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.869" end="01:04:46.569" style="s2">some kind of relationship of coherence</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.539" end="01:04:49.720" style="s2">with not to objectify the thing but to</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.569" end="01:04:52.109" style="s2">get some of that inner counsel having an</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.720" end="01:04:56.200" style="s2">opportunity to express themselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.109" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">through a a channeled like because we</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.200" end="01:05:00.999" style="s2">take all this content all this maelstrom</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">of content and possibility and somehow</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.999" end="01:05:05.079" style="s2">right now on the tip of my tongue these</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">next words there&#39;s a it&#39;s coming out in</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.079" end="01:05:10.269" style="s2">some way and of course like what am I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:11.740" style="s2">referencing a lot and it might not be</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.269" end="01:05:13.450" style="s2">clear but there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.740" end="01:05:16.589" style="s2">there&#39;s an honest attempt to channel it</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.450" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s coherent in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.589" end="01:05:22.869" style="s2">allows a certain amount of clear light</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:24.309" style="s2">to transmit and then we can all partake</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.869" end="01:05:26.769" style="s2">in that light together and we can go</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.309" end="01:05:30.130" style="s2">back and forth so to create the medium</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.769" end="01:05:32.279" style="s2">of excommunication in one&#39;s own domain</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.130" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">to whatever degree one can but then</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.279" end="01:05:36.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to seek those relationships</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:39.849" style="s2">with other people and it&#39;s a project</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.549" end="01:05:41.410" style="s2">over a long periods of time you know if</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.849" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">you find yourself isolated when they</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.410" end="01:05:44.289" style="s2">when things happen and to be honest with</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:46.569" style="s2">you I&#39;ve met lots of people who have</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.289" end="01:05:48.670" style="s2">profound experiences particularly with</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.569" end="01:05:50.289" style="s2">psychedelics without practices to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.670" end="01:05:52.059" style="s2">integrate them with and by the way going</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.289" end="01:05:54.039" style="s2">back to the mat and meditating is going</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.059" end="01:05:55.509" style="s2">to be a way to integrate these things on</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.039" end="01:05:57.489" style="s2">a continued basis as well I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.509" end="01:05:58.809" style="s2">everything has but the outwardness of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.489" end="01:06:03.460" style="s2">expression I personally think is quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.809" end="01:06:05.799" style="s2">important but you know I meet a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.460" end="01:06:07.809" style="s2">people who take psychedelics and have</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.799" end="01:06:10.829" style="s2">very powerful experiences and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.809" end="01:06:13.989" style="s2">seem to do them any good apart from to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.829" end="01:06:15.759" style="s2">hit them with a massive dose of deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.989" end="01:06:18.069" style="s2">dissatisfaction with everyone around</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.759" end="01:06:21.549" style="s2">them because they just can&#39;t find a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.069" end="01:06:24.999" style="s2">to express themselves in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.549" end="01:06:26.859" style="s2">truly heard and that enters into a</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.999" end="01:06:28.239" style="s2">loving construction constructive</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.859" end="01:06:30.190" style="s2">relationship with someone else it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.239" end="01:06:32.109" style="s2">any easy thing to do to speak about a</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.190" end="01:06:34.630" style="s2">lot of this stuff given I mean as you</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.109" end="01:06:38.589" style="s2">were saying we don&#39;t have their words to</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.630" end="01:06:40.599" style="s2">describe a lot of the cannot only the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.589" end="01:06:42.850" style="s2">content we experience but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.599" end="01:06:45.760" style="s2">the it&#39;s like a reorientation in</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.850" end="01:06:47.320" style="s2">of mind you know we we go from thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.760" end="01:06:49.300" style="s2">about it depends how seriously we take</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.320" end="01:06:52.150" style="s2">this whole cognitive grammar thing right</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.300" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">at John John&#39;s always talking about how</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.150" end="01:06:55.990" style="s2">seriously we take the cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.920" end="01:06:57.730" style="s2">that structures the flow of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.990" end="01:06:59.320" style="s2">expression fundamentally but it</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.730" end="01:07:01.540" style="s2">structures it because it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.320" end="01:07:03.790" style="s2">perceptual lens through which we filter</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.540" end="01:07:06.280" style="s2">it&#39;s part of that thing which filters</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.790" end="01:07:09.070" style="s2">perception through to expression so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.280" end="01:07:13.300" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of can be parasitic in</p>

<p begin="01:08:11.020" end="01:08:17.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just like an agonizing agonizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.530" end="01:08:21.910" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like man it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.560" end="01:08:25.270" style="s2">beautiful thing we can live and but but</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.910" end="01:08:28.030" style="s2">but - but to then speak about how it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.270" end="01:08:29.980" style="s2">we can live over long periods of time</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.030" end="01:08:32.530" style="s2">given how powerful we are as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.980" end="01:08:34.960" style="s2">technological civilization now given the</p>

<p begin="01:08:40.030" end="01:08:46.870" style="s2">of years of death it&#39;s like man</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.100" end="01:08:50.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big deal to turn all</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.870" end="01:08:52.810" style="s2">that stuff around so where is it comes</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.980" end="01:08:56.110" style="s2">it really comes back I can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.810" end="01:08:59.360" style="s2">being here talking to each other is</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.110" end="01:09:03.340" style="s2">demonstrative of you know an honest</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.360" end="01:09:06.500" style="s2">attempt to engage in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.340" end="01:09:11.630" style="s2">collaborative inquiry a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.500" end="01:09:13.850" style="s2">which hopefully can spark to that which</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.630" end="01:09:18.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve experienced and those aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.850" end="01:09:21.940" style="s2">ourselves which are seeking to meet in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.010" end="01:09:27.740" style="s2">ground or in a space where they have</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.940" end="01:09:32.750" style="s2">time to be valued and that can even be</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.740" end="01:09:36.760" style="s2">perceived at all we are to find find the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.750" end="01:09:42.110" style="s2">people who are ready of their own</p>

<p begin="01:09:49.220" end="01:10:01.010" style="s2">process so yeah I think that&#39;s hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.000" end="01:10:02.690" style="s2">a bit of an answer yeah actually I found</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.010" end="01:10:06.260" style="s2">that very helpful you touched upon a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.690" end="01:10:08.750" style="s2">bunch of themes and I think I think I</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.260" end="01:10:13.760" style="s2">think really the big answer I got out of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.750" end="01:10:16.910" style="s2">that was it the informative experiences</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.760" end="01:10:19.130" style="s2">where you&#39;re in touch with the ineffable</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.910" end="01:10:21.830" style="s2">we should just call those profound</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.130" end="01:10:24.440" style="s2">experiences and solve that problem that</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.830" end="01:10:26.840" style="s2">way and then we should deal with why</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.440" end="01:10:30.050" style="s2">we&#39;re engaging in profound experiences</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.840" end="01:10:33.890" style="s2">that were unable to I want to say take</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.050" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">back with us from that place back into</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.890" end="01:10:38.870" style="s2">the place where we are and so that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:40.610" style="s2">be the problem this creates a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.870" end="01:10:42.890" style="s2">new problems of course but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.610" end="01:10:46.540" style="s2">this is why we&#39;re here thank you very</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.890" end="01:10:49.250" style="s2">much for that that wasn&#39;t quite helpful</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.540" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">thank you for the question you&#39;ve truly</p>

<p begin="01:11:08.330" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">better together</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.380" end="01:11:12.199" style="s2">I know that&#39;s what we&#39;re kind of doing</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.940" end="01:11:21.699" style="s2">answer questions it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:24.500" style="s2">exercise for me but I you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.699" end="01:11:25.940" style="s2">you know and there is such such thing as</p>

<p begin="01:11:31.820" end="01:11:37.250" style="s2">arrange right basically to do this over</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.290" end="01:11:39.699" style="s2">like six hours you know so there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.250" end="01:11:45.170" style="s2">there is something to be said for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.699" end="01:11:46.969" style="s2">but genuinely I know how much people who</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.170" end="01:11:51.650" style="s2">are interested in this stuff have to</p>

<p begin="01:11:58.280" end="01:12:03.469" style="s2">couple last question are you good on</p>

<p begin="01:12:11.480" end="01:12:16.489" style="s2">yeah go ahead I I&#39;ve listened to a fewer</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.929" end="01:12:18.590" style="s2">conversations and I&#39;m listening to live</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.489" end="01:12:24.530" style="s2">um no home appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.590" end="01:12:28.370" style="s2">I yeah man thank you wealthy of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.530" end="01:12:30.020" style="s2">and so I guess the most direct question</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.370" end="01:12:34.449" style="s2">I could ask and one that may be a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.020" end="01:12:38.719" style="s2">more productive in terms of generating</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.449" end="01:12:40.730" style="s2">too pragmatic stuff to discuss is what</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.719" end="01:12:43.070" style="s2">what can we do together what can we</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.730" end="01:12:45.560" style="s2">collaborate on all right what what is it</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.070" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">that we can do in this space with not</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.560" end="01:12:50.510" style="s2">just with our words but what is it then</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:53.480" style="s2">we construct virtually here that will</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.510" end="01:12:55.100" style="s2">lead us to perhaps even adjusting the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.480" end="01:12:58.600" style="s2">physical places in which we live that</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.100" end="01:13:01.400" style="s2">will bind us together not just in</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.600" end="01:13:04.850" style="s2">despair in distant words but also in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.400" end="01:13:07.969" style="s2">close and proximal loving relation right</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.850" end="01:13:11.239" style="s2">like this is I&#39;m interested in too so</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.969" end="01:13:13.489" style="s2">yeah it didn&#39;t has your mind touched on</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.239" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">any of that stuff have you haven&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.489" end="01:13:18.620" style="s2">is it that we could do to get in them I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:20.449" style="s2">mean every every day um because</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.620" end="01:13:21.869" style="s2">this stuff there&#39;s always been grounded</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.449" end="01:13:27.889" style="s2">for me and how can I actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.869" end="01:13:30.360" style="s2">like create something valuable in ours</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.889" end="01:13:31.619" style="s2">which becomes co-create something</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.360" end="01:13:34.619" style="s2">valuable enough that can actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.619" end="01:13:37.229" style="s2">sustain me to continue to do things and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.619" end="01:13:41.789" style="s2">to continue so yeah I mean it&#39;sit&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.229" end="01:13:44.329" style="s2">question um so here I kind of feel drawn</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.789" end="01:13:46.610" style="s2">to say some things that I hope we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.329" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">you know ask for some a bit of charity</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.610" end="01:13:52.949" style="s2">regarding because I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:54.780" style="s2">about what it is to sort of build</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.949" end="01:13:57.869" style="s2">community and how I can do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.780" end="01:13:59.639" style="s2">ethically and what kinds of things I</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.869" end="01:14:04.619" style="s2">want to build and where they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.639" end="01:14:07.559" style="s2">take place for a long time and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.619" end="01:14:11.429" style="s2">thought about discord and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.559" end="01:14:15.030" style="s2">realize is that the discord environment</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.429" end="01:14:17.010" style="s2">is feels to me kind of kind of bit</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.030" end="01:14:19.919" style="s2">saturated you know there&#39;s the portal</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.010" end="01:14:26.969" style="s2">there&#39;s this discord there&#39;s the rebel</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.919" end="01:14:30.809" style="s2">wisdom one and I realized that in my own</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.969" end="01:14:32.309" style="s2">work my own self I haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.809" end="01:14:37.499" style="s2">create something that&#39;s a strong enough</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.309" end="01:14:40.469" style="s2">attractor to have a kind of organic</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.499" end="01:14:42.780" style="s2">let&#39;s say community develop around the</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.469" end="01:14:45.659" style="s2">kinds of things I was doing so then I</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.780" end="01:14:49.050" style="s2">have to make a decision about well what</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.659" end="01:14:51.449" style="s2">stuff can I kind of drive myself or what</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.050" end="01:14:53.309" style="s2">communities can I involve myself in and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.449" end="01:14:56.010" style="s2">over the last few months I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.309" end="01:14:59.849" style="s2">building a website called voice craft</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.010" end="01:15:05.669" style="s2">collective calm and that is a network</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.849" end="01:15:08.249" style="s2">that you can join and it&#39;s got its built</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.669" end="01:15:10.709" style="s2">our mighty networks so you can create</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.249" end="01:15:14.129" style="s2">groups in there and private group secret</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.709" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">groups that it&#39;s basically like a social</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.129" end="01:15:19.110" style="s2">media type channel you can you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:26.329" style="s2">organize events and post articles and</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.110" end="01:15:30.649" style="s2">share things and I&#39;m what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.329" end="01:15:30.649" style="s2">with a big portion of my time</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.010" end="01:15:39.700" style="s2">building relationships slowly with</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.410" end="01:15:51.160" style="s2">people who are interesting of interested</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.700" end="01:15:56.440" style="s2">enough to with me coordinate places in</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.160" end="01:15:59.710" style="s2">time coordinate structures where certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.440" end="01:16:01.570" style="s2">inquiry enquiries can be deepened so</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.710" end="01:16:05.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a website called eg P dot</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.570" end="01:16:11.820" style="s2">community the ephemeral group process my</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.440" end="01:16:20.320" style="s2">sense is that the EDP process mixed with</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.820" end="01:16:24.030" style="s2">developers will enable the deepening of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.320" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">questions which can be tracked and</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.030" end="01:16:30.640" style="s2">offered as gifts to other communities</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:33.790" style="s2">and offered to the world and in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.640" end="01:16:35.410" style="s2">Theotokos component offering impetus</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.790" end="01:16:38.740" style="s2">being basically meaningful dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.410" end="01:16:40.480" style="s2">together enabling a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.740" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">working through of these themes and</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.480" end="01:16:49.300" style="s2">concepts will enable a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:51.430" style="s2">to say between six but maybe even up to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.300" end="01:16:56.140" style="s2">like 100 maybe more that have break off</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.430" end="01:16:59.190" style="s2">into groups of maybe six and undergo</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.140" end="01:17:03.030" style="s2">processes of inquiry which end up</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.190" end="01:17:06.100" style="s2">extracting synthesizing rather questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.030" end="01:17:07.870" style="s2">which then become further objects of</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.100" end="01:17:10.660" style="s2">contemplate contemplation and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.870" end="01:17:13.330" style="s2">process continues to deepen and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.660" end="01:17:15.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone on a four to six or eight</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.330" end="01:17:16.390" style="s2">week journey with each other and over</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.190" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2">the course of that time we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.390" end="01:17:22.240" style="s2">number of conversations we&#39;ve tracked a</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:26.500" style="s2">bunch of questions and well now we see</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.240" end="01:17:28.570" style="s2">where we are so the idea would be and</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.500" end="01:17:31.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea with EGP which you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.570" end="01:17:34.240" style="s2">read on the website is that these are</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.210" end="01:17:37.960" style="s2">processes that communities local and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.240" end="01:17:39.880" style="s2">digital can engage in to help bring the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.960" end="01:17:43.570" style="s2">full complexity of cognition that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.880" end="01:17:44.160" style="s2">have to offer to be able to ask better</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.570" end="01:17:45.900" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.160" end="01:17:49.650" style="s2">do the problem formulation better and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.900" end="01:17:55.110" style="s2">through that question asking you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.650" end="01:17:57.120" style="s2">answers will come and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.110" end="01:17:59.820" style="s2">collaborations of you know actuated</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.120" end="01:18:01.230" style="s2">things in the real world happen maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.820" end="01:18:02.970" style="s2">they&#39;re about how do we solve particular</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.230" end="01:18:06.410" style="s2">problems in the real world depending on</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.970" end="01:18:10.920" style="s2">the group of people gathering already so</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.410" end="01:18:18.690" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of well I&#39;m thinking personally</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.920" end="01:18:21.090" style="s2">is that I basically want to attract you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.690" end="01:18:23.910" style="s2">know extend the invitations in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.090" end="01:18:25.890" style="s2">esoteric way to some number of hundred</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.910" end="01:18:28.950" style="s2">people hundreds of people probably not</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.890" end="01:18:34.710" style="s2">more than a few thousand to participate</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.950" end="01:18:37.290" style="s2">in a network where different enquiries</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.710" end="01:18:39.570" style="s2">have gone on that might that also bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.290" end="01:18:41.850" style="s2">in there might be in response to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.570" end="01:18:45.030" style="s2">conversations had by people that are</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.850" end="01:18:47.610" style="s2">already gathering attention in the space</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.030" end="01:18:56.820" style="s2">so you know John guy or you know that</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.610" end="01:18:59.610" style="s2">plenty of people that seek to deepen the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.820" end="01:19:02.670" style="s2">inquiry and then also understand well</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.610" end="01:19:03.930" style="s2">who can really add a lot of value to</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.670" end="01:19:06.630" style="s2">this discussion and how can we bring</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.930" end="01:19:09.360" style="s2">them in how can we something I call the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.630" end="01:19:12.090" style="s2">sacred art of invitation making how can</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.360" end="01:19:14.910" style="s2">we invite people to participate with us</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.090" end="01:19:19.770" style="s2">and have that invitation be evocative of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.910" end="01:19:23.310" style="s2">that same integrity that we commit</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.770" end="01:19:25.080" style="s2">ourselves to holding in that dialogue in</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.310" end="01:19:26.790" style="s2">that space in this space together now</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.080" end="01:19:28.290" style="s2">how can we create invitations that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.790" end="01:19:30.240" style="s2">resonate with that sort of integrity</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.290" end="01:19:33.300" style="s2">such that people will want to come along</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.240" end="01:19:36.930" style="s2">and add what they can so basically how</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.300" end="01:19:42.420" style="s2">to coordinate community inquiry and to</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.930" end="01:19:44.130" style="s2">in those processes figure out how to and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.420" end="01:19:45.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some ideas about this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.130" end="01:19:47.100" style="s2">so many there&#39;s so many aspects of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.780" end="01:19:54.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of like a schematic</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.100" end="01:19:56.760" style="s2">for building a community that allows</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.300" end="01:19:57.930" style="s2">people or for people the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.760" end="01:20:00.360" style="s2">really develop their</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.930" end="01:20:02.370" style="s2">capacity to listen to perceive and to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.360" end="01:20:03.990" style="s2">express and to genuinely involve</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.370" end="01:20:06.630" style="s2">themselves in the directionality of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.990" end="01:20:08.370" style="s2">inquiry and then to create artifacts</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.630" end="01:20:10.920" style="s2">through that which can be shared with</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.370" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">others which are helpful and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.920" end="01:20:16.220" style="s2">not maybe sometimes the artifacts aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:16.220" style="s2">created that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.340" end="01:20:24.240" style="s2">but yeah just I kind of it&#39;s it&#39;s Oh</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.710" end="01:20:26.400" style="s2">nebula is really just a right</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.240" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">relationship of communication Forest</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.400" end="01:20:31.140" style="s2">said to me that one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:32.730" style="s2">problems is that we just don&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.140" end="01:20:35.460" style="s2">enough time communicating and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.730" end="01:20:37.470" style="s2">community is looking to build they need</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.460" end="01:20:38.280" style="s2">to spend about 1/3 of the time just in</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.470" end="01:20:41.820" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.280" end="01:20:44.360" style="s2">a good quality conversation and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.820" end="01:20:49.880" style="s2">just not enough time put into that often</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.360" end="01:20:55.110" style="s2">so really it&#39;s a matter of coordinating</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.880" end="01:20:59.940" style="s2">time and you know and then obviously</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.110" end="01:21:02.130" style="s2">resonating in the right way so my hope</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.940" end="01:21:05.340" style="s2">is that in sort of inviting people to</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.130" end="01:21:08.430" style="s2">join me in the journeys of inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.340" end="01:21:12.690" style="s2">inviting people to share their creations</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.430" end="01:21:15.620" style="s2">for you know in the engagement with</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.690" end="01:21:17.910" style="s2">others along that process that that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.620" end="01:21:19.710" style="s2">so Nora Bateson has a term called a</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.910" end="01:21:22.650" style="s2">mutual learning environment samatha sea</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.710" end="01:21:24.540" style="s2">which is a beautiful term and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.650" end="01:21:26.760" style="s2">that&#39;s got to be part of it how do how</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.540" end="01:21:31.440" style="s2">do we create these mutual amber learning</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.760" end="01:21:35.220" style="s2">environments together so we learn as we</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.440" end="01:21:37.080" style="s2">deepen inquiry and have that matter</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.220" end="01:21:41.930" style="s2">because well the inquiry is directly</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.080" end="01:21:45.960" style="s2">relevant to problems of world making</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.930" end="01:21:50.070" style="s2">culture building building languages of</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.960" end="01:21:51.660" style="s2">communication but then that&#39;s one part</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.070" end="01:21:54.450" style="s2">of it there&#39;s a bunch more to say about</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.660" end="01:21:56.760" style="s2">what I personally think is required in</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.450" end="01:22:00.480" style="s2">the broader public media space which I</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.760" end="01:22:04.920" style="s2">actually feel as though what I have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.480" end="01:22:09.420" style="s2">say about that and I kind of want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.920" end="01:22:10.900" style="s2">explore it privately or at least not non</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.420" end="01:22:12.670" style="s2">recorded</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.900" end="01:22:13.870" style="s2">which is kind of interesting right</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.670" end="01:22:20.100" style="s2">almost goes against some of the things</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.870" end="01:22:27.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve been saying but the thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.100" end="01:22:34.150" style="s2">ownership of brand of the medium or</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.790" end="01:22:39.159" style="s2">platform that houses the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.150" end="01:22:42.580" style="s2">conversations required I think to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.159" end="01:22:45.969" style="s2">cathartic and transformative at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.580" end="01:22:50.320" style="s2">level political and social in our time</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.969" end="01:22:53.290" style="s2">given its fractured nature I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.320" end="01:22:56.739" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that space can be owned I</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.290" end="01:22:58.300" style="s2">don&#39;t think it can work if the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.739" end="01:23:02.710" style="s2">conversations are taking place in</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.300" end="01:23:07.260" style="s2">someone&#39;s house that they own I actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.710" end="01:23:11.230" style="s2">think we need to collaborate in</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.260" end="01:23:18.159" style="s2">basically building a Burning Man type</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.230" end="01:23:24.040" style="s2">dynamic of structure that recedes once</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.159" end="01:23:25.929" style="s2">its event occurs and the only thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.040" end="01:23:27.730" style="s2">remains is the integrity of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.929" end="01:23:30.340" style="s2">established among those who participated</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.730" end="01:23:32.860" style="s2">and co-created but that the actual</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.340" end="01:23:34.330" style="s2">structure itself there&#39;s kind of two</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.860" end="01:23:35.530" style="s2">things like on the one hand I want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.330" end="01:23:37.989" style="s2">participate with people in their own</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.530" end="01:23:39.550" style="s2">communities in a network I&#39;m building</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.989" end="01:23:41.110" style="s2">but then I also recognize there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.550" end="01:23:44.230" style="s2">other thing that has to be built that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.110" end="01:23:50.469" style="s2">has not been built anywhere and that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.230" end="01:23:52.030" style="s2">the kind of thing that I you know you</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.469" end="01:23:55.360" style="s2">know i probe already said quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.030" end="01:23:59.080" style="s2">about that there so well that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.360" end="01:24:03.580" style="s2">you signed up for your your your</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.080" end="01:24:05.350" style="s2">collective website there so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.580" end="01:24:07.630" style="s2">fascinated with everyone&#39;s minor</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.350" end="01:24:10.830" style="s2">variation on the theme here that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.630" end="01:24:13.030" style="s2">all searching for and I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.830" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m deeply interested in</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.030" end="01:24:18.370" style="s2">participating in a lot of it and I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:21.100" style="s2">that we do have a chance here to to have</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.370" end="01:24:24.130" style="s2">the serious play where we do experiment</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.100" end="01:24:24.650" style="s2">with configurations and ways of getting</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.130" end="01:24:26.960" style="s2">to know each</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.650" end="01:24:30.440" style="s2">and getting into ourselves where by</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.960" end="01:24:32.420" style="s2">maybe in the future we can avoid some of</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.440" end="01:24:36.020" style="s2">the pitfalls that we&#39;ve discovered over</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.420" end="01:24:39.110" style="s2">the past 50 or 60 years of modernity</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.020" end="01:24:41.600" style="s2">that in the integration of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.110" end="01:24:44.360" style="s2">with this technological layer and with a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.600" end="01:24:48.970" style="s2">hyper abundance of of all that that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.360" end="01:24:51.170" style="s2">entailed by it and the differential</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.970" end="01:24:54.170" style="s2">accumulation of those abundances let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.170" end="01:24:56.180" style="s2">say in the presence of the yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.170" end="01:24:58.520" style="s2">all of these things are finally in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.180" end="01:25:01.280" style="s2">place where at least the self-interested</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.520" end="01:25:03.980" style="s2">and drawn can start to really address</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.280" end="01:25:06.410" style="s2">them right so we can finally be end and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.980" end="01:25:07.700" style="s2">a node so yeah I don&#39;t want to lose idea</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.410" end="01:25:09.740" style="s2">of this notion that I think the Burning</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.700" end="01:25:11.720" style="s2">Man is key I think that is not leaveneth</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.740" end="01:25:15.440" style="s2">the ephemeral quality of what it takes</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.720" end="01:25:18.440" style="s2">to dynamically self-assemble into a</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.440" end="01:25:20.300" style="s2">vehicle it has the capacities right</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.440" end="01:25:23.560" style="s2">distributed amongst themself that</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.300" end="01:25:25.970" style="s2">efficient mean functionally is its</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.560" end="01:25:28.640" style="s2">representative of the same things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.970" end="01:25:30.890" style="s2">we need in order to make sense at</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.640" end="01:25:32.990" style="s2">multiple layers here in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.890" end="01:25:37.480" style="s2">modern culture and so we need any</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.990" end="01:25:40.640" style="s2">encourage that seems like a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.480" end="01:25:43.850" style="s2">yeah I think you&#39;re gonna find out a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.640" end="01:25:45.860" style="s2">of a lot of overlap between your what</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.850" end="01:25:48.950" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.860" end="01:25:50.900" style="s2">so anything you know that we can do to</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.950" end="01:25:54.380" style="s2">help with that and coordinate with you</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.900" end="01:25:58.130" style="s2">and you coordinate with us and yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.380" end="01:26:00.710" style="s2">would love to to help bring bring these</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.130" end="01:26:03.560" style="s2">yeah bring us together and work together</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.710" end="01:26:06.130" style="s2">on them yeah I&#39;ve got a buddy back</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.560" end="01:26:09.650" style="s2">launching called meta gora right this is</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.130" end="01:26:12.590" style="s2">just if each of these communities is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.650" end="01:26:14.660" style="s2">city on the map I want there to be as</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.590" end="01:26:17.390" style="s2">obvious and interstate between those</p>

<p begin="01:26:20.390" end="01:26:26.330" style="s2">really whimsical been missing is a easy</p>

<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:34.070" style="s2">exists in this in the space so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.850" end="01:26:38.130" style="s2">deeply ashamed of anyone else doing that</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.070" end="01:26:40.310" style="s2">too yeah it was just it was a bit of a</p>

<p begin="01:26:40.310" end="01:26:44.160" style="s2">part of the journey for me I was like</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.960" end="01:26:46.140" style="s2">right at the beginning I could be part</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.160" end="01:26:49.470" style="s2">of transformative conversations a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.140" end="01:26:53.310" style="s2">making conversations but I actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.470" end="01:26:55.290" style="s2">don&#39;t think at the you know in</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.310" end="01:26:57.330" style="s2">everyone&#39;s community in everyone&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.620" end="01:27:10.380" style="s2">be doing everyone should be doing that</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.000" end="01:27:13.290" style="s2">everyone like as much of that as</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.380" end="01:27:14.550" style="s2">possible as a good thing but then what</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.290" end="01:27:19.350" style="s2">you know in terms of what that</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.550" end="01:27:21.840" style="s2">interstate is like no one can I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.350" end="01:27:23.340" style="s2">think the interstate can be just another</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.840" end="01:27:26.160" style="s2">community that&#39;s the thing about it</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.340" end="01:27:28.860" style="s2">because well that&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.160" end="01:27:30.870" style="s2">community then like what is it to to</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.860" end="01:27:32.610" style="s2">actually collaborate together among</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.870" end="01:27:35.340" style="s2">communities to create something where</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.610" end="01:27:37.350" style="s2">there is that different space that</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.340" end="01:27:42.380" style="s2">different plane that&#39;s what it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.350" end="01:27:45.330" style="s2">what it looks like and so you know I</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.380" end="01:27:48.320" style="s2">mean I invite I invite the contemplation</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.330" end="01:27:53.060" style="s2">regarding regarding that notion because</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.320" end="01:27:56.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s an interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.060" end="01:27:58.980" style="s2">sending out invitations summonings who</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.250" end="01:28:02.880" style="s2">are fun stuff perhaps this is the space</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.980" end="01:28:04.410" style="s2">of the shaman the modern day shop with</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.880" end="01:28:08.130" style="s2">just attaching the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.410" end="01:28:09.420" style="s2">psychopomp to it there&#39;s a divestment</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.130" end="01:28:11.550" style="s2">that has to occur with your identity</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.420" end="01:28:16.170" style="s2">right you have to be willing to</p>

<p begin="01:28:16.170" end="01:28:21.230" style="s2">to identify with empathize with the</p>

<p begin="01:28:21.230" end="01:28:25.890" style="s2">aspects are representative of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.400" end="01:28:28.050" style="s2">language that you encounter and then you</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.890" end="01:28:30.510" style="s2">have to extrapolate from that the deeper</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.050" end="01:28:32.520" style="s2">subterranean layers of meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.510" end="01:28:34.980" style="s2">everyone has discovered in their</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.520" end="01:28:36.240" style="s2">exponents perience right that represents</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.980" end="01:28:38.370" style="s2">the truth of the language and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.240" end="01:28:40.650" style="s2">culture that&#39;s developed there and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.370" end="01:28:44.820" style="s2">see where that&#39;s conciliate across all</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.650" end="01:28:46.950" style="s2">of these smaller organizations of</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.820" end="01:28:48.240" style="s2">experience and and in the process of</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.950" end="01:28:50.340" style="s2">doing that I think you&#39;re fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.240" end="01:28:52.190" style="s2">transformed into a particular shape but</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.340" end="01:28:57.200" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.190" end="01:29:00.050" style="s2">my medically diverse constantly</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.200" end="01:29:02.760" style="s2">reconfiguring you know dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.050" end="01:29:04.250" style="s2">searching criticality I mean when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.760" end="01:29:06.270" style="s2">come up with a million different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.250" end="01:29:08.720" style="s2">mmm right this but it&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.270" end="01:29:11.310" style="s2">what our brain is doing it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.720" end="01:29:12.990" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re doing this that performing</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.310" end="01:29:15.780" style="s2">this is the cultural layer now right</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.990" end="01:29:17.910" style="s2">that we&#39;re absorbing these old items</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.780" end="01:29:20.640" style="s2">and attempting to make not just a</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.910" end="01:29:23.160" style="s2">narrative but a methodology for</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.640" end="01:29:25.440" style="s2">maneuvering through the narrative right</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.160" end="01:29:27.330" style="s2">to place ourselves in different aspects</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.440" end="01:29:28.950" style="s2">of it and different perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.330" end="01:29:30.900" style="s2">angles and find out what what may or may</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.950" end="01:29:34.920" style="s2">not be consistent across all of it and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.900" end="01:29:39.660" style="s2">find the true connective tissue let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.920" end="01:29:40.710" style="s2">say so yeah yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.660" end="01:29:42.960" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.710" end="01:29:45.840" style="s2">connective tissue and at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.960" end="01:29:49.140" style="s2">it&#39;s for you know arguably it&#39;s for a</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.840" end="01:29:50.640" style="s2">shape that has not been made that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.140" end="01:29:52.350" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like in that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.640" end="01:29:53.910" style="s2">with Allison I recorded the last one of</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.350" end="01:29:55.950" style="s2">my podcast it goes into a bit more in</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.910" end="01:29:58.230" style="s2">part two about one of these ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.950" end="01:30:01.800" style="s2">has been gripping me for so long is to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.230" end="01:30:04.590" style="s2">understand what the sort of a novel</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.800" end="01:30:07.100" style="s2">archetype archetypal form would be like</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.590" end="01:30:09.510" style="s2">can we actually make sense of that idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.100" end="01:30:10.980" style="s2">because you know obviously Nietzsche had</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.510" end="01:30:14.670" style="s2">the idea of the eternal recurrence of</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.980" end="01:30:16.260" style="s2">the same but it&#39;s like mmm the thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.670" end="01:30:17.490" style="s2">we&#39;re and people talk about feeling the</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.260" end="01:30:19.080" style="s2">elephant I&#39;m not I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.490" end="01:30:21.510" style="s2">feeling a elephant we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.080" end="01:30:26.070" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s might not be</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.510" end="01:30:27.270" style="s2">an elephant so right yeah well so like</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.070" end="01:30:30.030" style="s2">we you can think of it as like</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.270" end="01:30:32.310" style="s2">space-filling right like if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.030" end="01:30:34.410" style="s2">cubic volume of space what is the shape</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.310" end="01:30:36.870" style="s2">of stuff that can be in there and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.410" end="01:30:39.510" style="s2">what what can it what it can what it can</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.870" end="01:30:41.850" style="s2">do right me so in our age we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.510" end="01:30:43.770" style="s2">we&#39;re now understanding what it is to</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.850" end="01:30:45.720" style="s2">build up more and more complexity from</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.770" end="01:30:48.660" style="s2">very simple structures underneath right</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.720" end="01:30:50.760" style="s2">and a kind of heterogeneous mix of</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.660" end="01:30:52.260" style="s2">different substances with different</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.760" end="01:30:54.300" style="s2">capacities produces a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.260" end="01:30:57.120" style="s2">synergistic output that that it can do</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.300" end="01:30:58.350" style="s2">more than the sum of its parts and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.120" end="01:31:00.300" style="s2">then we have a good conception of</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.350" end="01:31:02.610" style="s2">something like metamaterials where</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.300" end="01:31:05.770" style="s2">further and further</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.610" end="01:31:08.020" style="s2">complexity leads to new configurations</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.770" end="01:31:11.130" style="s2">and orientations in that volume of space</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.020" end="01:31:15.430" style="s2">that that the material is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.130" end="01:31:17.800" style="s2">capable of new properties right it can</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.430" end="01:31:20.140" style="s2">do new entry paintings is not just</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.800" end="01:31:22.150" style="s2">extending its prior capacities but new</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.140" end="01:31:24.220" style="s2">and interesting things so yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.150" end="01:31:27.190" style="s2">yeah there that we that we can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.220" end="01:31:29.800" style="s2">grasp yet and it is probably always the</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.190" end="01:31:32.740" style="s2">ineffable aspect of novelty that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.800" end="01:31:35.560" style="s2">never be able to fully contain within a</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.740" end="01:31:39.460" style="s2">language or a writable form</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.560" end="01:31:41.980" style="s2">but nevertheless I think we like that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.460" end="01:31:43.630" style="s2">what our calling is as attentive</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.980" end="01:31:45.640" style="s2">conscious creatures is to do the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.630" end="01:31:46.360" style="s2">transformational process what what the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.640" end="01:31:48.760" style="s2">psychopomp</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.360" end="01:31:50.920" style="s2">is fundamentally doing is translating</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.760" end="01:31:54.160" style="s2">from that chaotic realm of potential</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.920" end="01:31:56.800" style="s2">what is actual what can be in what</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.160" end="01:31:59.500" style="s2">figurations are possible with the energy</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.800" end="01:32:00.760" style="s2">levels that were gifted so I just want</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.500" end="01:32:02.770" style="s2">to jump jump in for a sec the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.760" end="01:32:05.470" style="s2">conversation can continue but I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.770" end="01:32:06.460" style="s2">to bring the the official Q&amp;A to a do to</p>
