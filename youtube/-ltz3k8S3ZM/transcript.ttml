<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">the doublet leaping I argued that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">is a misuse of the word induction and we</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.420" end="00:05:13.400" style="s2">in a summary answer of lepers okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">so right the cognitive leaders are in</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:35.630" style="s2">fashion it&#39;s something that can be done</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.070" end="00:05:37.160" style="s2">better by neural networks than by</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.350" end="00:05:44.510" style="s2">suggested very strongly that this might</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.450" end="00:05:46.700" style="s2">be going on in in problem solving and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.510" end="00:05:49.820" style="s2">accorded up skills are also considered</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2">that insight would be more skill like in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.820" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">nature than propositional in nature okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">then of course we pursue the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.520" end="00:06:08.660" style="s2">the subject of framework was not going</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">to just lay back and all of this with</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.920" end="00:07:39.730" style="s2">they need to do is to say that in order</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.830" end="00:07:58.420" style="s2">an interesting question I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.390" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">that they don&#39;t point is succeed on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.420" end="00:08:03.010" style="s2">because the heuristic that they argue is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:05.350" style="s2">operating at the meta level is the</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:43.960" style="s2">that right so they took a look at some</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.210" end="00:09:05.650" style="s2">manipulated this just a variable the</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.350" end="00:09:15.820" style="s2">people were to come up with some</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:27.130" style="s2">came down to is they barreled that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.570" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">flexibility in noticing this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.130" end="00:09:32.740" style="s2">notion of flexibility and noticing</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.140" end="00:09:46.120" style="s2">to solve really just I&#39;m so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.490" style="s2">interesting about that then is this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.120" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">this is also prescient I think an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.490" end="00:09:54.250" style="s2">important way of the increasing</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">flexibility is almost always measured by</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.770" end="00:10:18.910" style="s2">it more desert like certainly Hughes</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.910" end="00:10:21.820" style="s2">one thing what they did is they replaced</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:30.419" style="s2">and people would notice that the two</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.419" end="00:10:35.639" style="s2">and then they would go over to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.279" end="00:10:37.109" style="s2">saying that they&#39;re helped because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.639" end="00:10:39.629" style="s2">that&#39;s important by the way is when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.109" end="00:10:42.059" style="s2">talk about as an intermediary and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.629" end="00:10:44.729" style="s2">they were in what you can do is create</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.059" end="00:10:47.399" style="s2">you can create sort of independently</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.729" end="00:10:49.979" style="s2">measured levels of difficulty for the</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.529" end="00:11:18.419" style="s2">turn your hand up earlier yeah how would</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.289" end="00:11:21.509" style="s2">the level communicated something that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.419" end="00:11:23.759" style="s2">not discussed and that&#39;s part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.509" end="00:11:28.799" style="s2">also part of it something that I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.759" end="00:11:33.449" style="s2">welcome the issue about what the</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.379" end="00:11:51.929" style="s2">and so what the nature of that shifting</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.569" end="00:11:53.909" style="s2">is because presumably there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.929" end="00:11:57.250" style="s2">we have to be careful to not to desert</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.909" end="00:12:00.279" style="s2">rib you to them but it sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.250" end="00:12:02.829" style="s2">it&#39;s not computational process the</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.170" style="s2">back sounds a little bit like the very</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.170" end="00:12:24.430" style="s2">explained yes but what I&#39;m arguing I</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.810" end="00:12:29.230" style="s2">connected that problem in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:31.720" style="s2">the notice in very serious things will</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.230" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">be a very salty problem and that what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.720" end="00:12:35.620" style="s2">they&#39;re relying on is by altering</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.250" end="00:12:38.620" style="s2">salient that somehow in a</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:49.300" style="s2">there&#39;s something what would a theory</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.350" end="00:13:09.850" style="s2">things like the Necker cube which is a</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.220" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">because you are you mention your</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.000" end="00:13:31.809" style="s2">oh and I said that was like the Necker</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.809" end="00:13:36.430" style="s2">well no but just like what would you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:38.139" style="s2">said to me Oh the thing about oh so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.430" end="00:13:40.329" style="s2">was how they manipulated the pair that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.139" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">the salience of the parity cube they</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.329" end="00:13:43.449" style="s2">replaced the white but they would put on</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.040" end="00:13:44.889" style="s2">the white and black squares of the chess</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.449" end="00:13:46.839" style="s2">board they replaced them with the words</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.889" end="00:13:49.930" style="s2">bread and butter which maple which</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.839" end="00:13:52.420" style="s2">helped people notice that the two corner</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.930" end="00:13:53.889" style="s2">pieces were the same that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.420" end="00:13:55.899" style="s2">preparing and that&#39;s what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.889" end="00:13:57.569" style="s2">notice in order to solve the mutilator</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.899" end="00:14:00.939" style="s2">chessboard</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.569" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">okay so who did this Kaplan and Simon if</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.939" end="00:14:05.350" style="s2">I want to be is our experimental</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:07.480" style="s2">manipulations but so so they completed</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.350" end="00:14:09.879" style="s2">it I just don&#39;t happen to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.480" end="00:14:15.569" style="s2">clear please did the pieces we get you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.879" end="00:14:21.129" style="s2">have to have our chessboard is laid out</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.569" end="00:14:24.009" style="s2">right and you have like where this would</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.129" end="00:14:27.779" style="s2">be white it&#39;s a bar okay this would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.009" end="00:14:27.779" style="s2">black you see Brett oh can I give it</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.470" end="00:14:39.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve been cool though they put things</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.150" end="00:14:41.780" style="s2">that people expect to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.800" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">together like peanut butter and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.780" end="00:14:48.200" style="s2">chocolate in chocolate or something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:50.200" style="s2">is like the same because you do put</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.200" end="00:14:53.660" style="s2">butter on bread too I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.200" end="00:14:56.030" style="s2">any other questions about that so far</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.660" end="00:14:59.090" style="s2">click these questions ok so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.030" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">back to it now look at what&#39;s coming out</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.090" end="00:15:06.230" style="s2">of the capital in fine print you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:07.930" style="s2">make insight better in people similarly</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.230" end="00:15:11.090" style="s2">this is something we would want to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.930" end="00:15:16.670" style="s2">right by training your attentional</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.090" end="00:15:20.120" style="s2">skills by making them increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.670" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">sensitive to how they are distributing</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.120" end="00:15:28.400" style="s2">salience on to stimuli by also</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:31.880" style="s2">increasing their awareness of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.400" end="00:15:33.830" style="s2">flexibility to alter what they find</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.880" end="00:15:36.430" style="s2">sailing and relevant by redirecting</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.830" end="00:15:36.430" style="s2">their attention</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.090" end="00:15:45.700" style="s2">you&#39;d want to be doing this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.430" end="00:15:50.110" style="s2">monitoring should be done in a non</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.700" end="00:15:52.030" style="s2">inferential fashion I hesitate to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.110" end="00:15:54.130" style="s2">nonverbal for reasons of a contactor but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.030" end="00:15:56.920" style="s2">at least did not get parental house now</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.130" end="00:15:59.560" style="s2">while I mention that list because that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.920" end="00:16:04.750" style="s2">is a list of the kinds of things you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.560" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">train in mindfulness practices that</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.750" end="00:16:09.100" style="s2">means that there&#39;s a prediction</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">obviously this is a post fictional I</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.100" end="00:16:16.960" style="s2">prefer much rim-116 but when I started</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:23.140" style="s2">lecturing this in session it was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.960" end="00:16:25.570" style="s2">prediction and namely that we would find</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.140" end="00:16:28.030" style="s2">that increased training in mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.570" end="00:16:30.640" style="s2">practices enhance enhances people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.030" end="00:16:33.990" style="s2">inside problem-solving ability and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.640" end="00:16:37.330" style="s2">there&#39;s increasing experimental evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.990" end="00:16:42.130" style="s2">confirming that like mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.330" end="00:16:43.960" style="s2">training enhances inside policy okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.130" end="00:16:47.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a post diction now but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.960" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">prediction then okay so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.470" end="00:16:53.290" style="s2">topics would we&#39;ll move on to consider</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:56.170" style="s2">is a connection between mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.290" end="00:17:01.060" style="s2">insight something you should know is I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.170" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">started teaching about this within 97</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.060" end="00:17:07.449" style="s2">and taking a look at not people from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.920" style="s2">Buddhist world but from a psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.449" end="00:17:11.680" style="s2">he started doing work on mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.920" end="00:17:16.300" style="s2">independently Allen Langer in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.680" end="00:17:19.210" style="s2">I believe that I was the first person to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.300" end="00:17:22.750" style="s2">academically teach about my friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.210" end="00:17:25.660" style="s2">and it was actually because of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.750" end="00:17:28.930" style="s2">funny prediction coming out of this time</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.660" end="00:17:30.610" style="s2">so again this experiment I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.930" end="00:17:32.560" style="s2">respect for even though I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.610" end="00:17:34.420" style="s2">disagree with their final theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.560" end="00:17:38.500" style="s2">cut because they&#39;re doing really good</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.420" end="00:17:40.600" style="s2">science it&#39;s really theoretically fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.500" end="00:17:45.460" style="s2">grained in a way that makes several</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.600" end="00:17:47.530" style="s2">important predictions yes um if insight</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.460" end="00:17:48.850" style="s2">is like linked to like um some measures</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.530" end="00:17:51.070" style="s2">of like fluid intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.850" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">your mom could meditation like</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.070" end="00:17:55.180" style="s2">theoretically mechanically measures of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:57.550" style="s2">toe to toe so there are seems to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.180" end="00:18:00.750" style="s2">first of all those difficulties are</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.550" end="00:18:00.750" style="s2">about distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.290" end="00:18:09.430" style="s2">sort of the rational enhancement of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:12.790" style="s2">abilities and their natural capacity but</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.430" end="00:18:14.650" style="s2">there is indication that extended</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.790" end="00:18:17.650" style="s2">mindfulness practice does alter</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.650" end="00:18:19.930" style="s2">attentional abilities and there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.650" end="00:18:23.110" style="s2">be some indication is alters working</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.930" end="00:18:24.970" style="s2">memory and those things do both seem to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.110" end="00:18:27.910" style="s2">be highly correlated with measures of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.970" end="00:18:30.970" style="s2">fluid intelligence it&#39;s be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.910" end="00:18:32.800" style="s2">this stuff because the language we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.970" end="00:18:35.410" style="s2">around intelligence and distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.800" end="00:18:36.610" style="s2">it from rationality needs to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.410" end="00:18:42.210" style="s2">a little bit more rigorously and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.610" end="00:18:42.210" style="s2">carefully within psychology okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.510" end="00:18:49.159" style="s2">like so I would I would prefer saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.580" end="00:18:50.510" style="s2">this and for something you jumping 71</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.159" end="00:18:53.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t like arguments for it</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.510" end="00:18:56.570" style="s2">I was preferred to say that mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.890" end="00:18:58.970" style="s2">increases it makes your attentional</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.570" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">processes more rational rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:03.860" style="s2">saying makes them more intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:05.270" style="s2">now if you have problem that because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.860" end="00:19:06.820" style="s2">think that rational need was logical</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.270" end="00:19:09.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem we should discuss</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.820" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">there&#39;s very good reason for not saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.350" end="00:19:16.279" style="s2">that rational equals logical and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">restoration objection 371 some like</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.279" end="00:19:19.640" style="s2">intelligence would be more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:20.899" style="s2">something like hardware I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.640" end="00:19:22.190" style="s2">way to think about intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.899" end="00:19:22.580" style="s2">something is directly relevant to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.190" end="00:19:24.590" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.580" end="00:19:26.630" style="s2">I think Stanovich is argument that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.590" end="00:19:27.850" style="s2">intelligence is the brain&#39;s capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.630" end="00:19:30.770" style="s2">dealing with computational limitations</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.850" end="00:19:33.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s basic ability to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.770" end="00:19:35.240" style="s2">combinatorial explosion is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.080" end="00:19:37.159" style="s2">measuring in intelligence that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.240" end="00:19:39.640" style="s2">same thing as measuring the brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.159" end="00:19:43.539" style="s2">ability to optimally achieve its goals</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.640" end="00:19:46.840" style="s2">which is what I think rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.539" end="00:19:46.840" style="s2">okay yep</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.550" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">yeah I think that I mean I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">anything there&#39;s a large mallet and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:16.740" style="s2">concurring argument I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:19.830" style="s2">rationality is when intelligence uses</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.740" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">psycho technologies to alter how we best</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.830" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">use our tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.519" end="00:20:31.059" style="s2">now we&#39;re getting into something what a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.960" end="00:20:34.360" style="s2">lot and so we&#39;re going to stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.059" end="00:20:34.929" style="s2">that but it&#39;s tantalizingly hope this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.360" end="00:20:38.100" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.929" end="00:20:41.559" style="s2">so this is we talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.100" end="00:20:43.899" style="s2">rationality and wisdom increase 71 okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.559" end="00:20:45.909" style="s2">now I did see why those might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.899" end="00:20:47.499" style="s2">relevant to the site myself we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.909" end="00:20:49.419" style="s2">talking about here now the questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.499" end="00:20:56.499" style="s2">several rise naturally about these kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.419" end="00:20:59.619" style="s2">of videos with Kelly analogy okay but</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.499" end="00:21:03.820" style="s2">that&#39;s all right so we&#39;ve got a couple</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.619" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">things to look forward to from Kaplan</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.820" end="00:21:08.049" style="s2">and timing right</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:10.299" style="s2">what are the things the most directly is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.049" end="00:21:12.340" style="s2">just shifting and also he is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.299" end="00:21:16.539" style="s2">with what cognitive processing is going</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.340" end="00:21:18.309" style="s2">on there and my concern my multi concern</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.539" end="00:21:20.139" style="s2">the additive her concern is that these</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.309" end="00:21:22.450" style="s2">two line I think that has a connection</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.139" end="00:21:26.230" style="s2">to is a stall t nature of the notice and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.450" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">very serious tip that shifting issue</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.230" end="00:21:34.299" style="s2">though and then this other issue about</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">the connections between sighted - okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.299" end="00:21:38.289" style="s2">what we&#39;re think about that - impressed</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:41.220" style="s2">and to prefigure oversight I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.289" end="00:21:43.869" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of really crappy research</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.220" end="00:21:46.149" style="s2">going on under the rubric of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.869" end="00:21:48.639" style="s2">research some of you might have taken</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.149" end="00:21:50.769" style="s2">471 evening last year where we took a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.639" end="00:21:52.779" style="s2">critical examination at the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.769" end="00:21:54.999" style="s2">concept in psychology a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.779" end="00:21:57.759" style="s2">experiments are very poorly designed a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.999" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">lot of the periodical debate is with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.759" end="00:22:03.100" style="s2">very shoddy option and the construct is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:06.100" style="s2">often demolished</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.100" end="00:22:08.440" style="s2">that being said I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.100" end="00:22:10.420" style="s2">research on mindfulness is actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.440" end="00:22:12.520" style="s2">taking place within Congress psychology</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.420" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">in connections between mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.520" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">inside my sentence of regulation rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:21.550" style="s2">than within clinical psychology where it</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:24.670" style="s2">is perfectly normally being said there</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.550" end="00:22:27.070" style="s2">you go just to give you some connections</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.670" end="00:22:29.650" style="s2">again between this course and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.070" end="00:22:32.020" style="s2">going on in the mindfulness research I</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.650" end="00:22:33.850" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to be more Molly case</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.020" end="00:22:36.180" style="s2">by the way as no scientific or more</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.850" end="00:22:42.040" style="s2">involved as it is in investigating</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.180" end="00:22:44.440" style="s2">mindfulness alright so what are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.040" end="00:22:47.650" style="s2">issues that were sort of floating around</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.440" end="00:22:51.040" style="s2">in Catherine Simon in it was this issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.650" end="00:22:54.070" style="s2">of you know noticing invariance picking</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.040" end="00:22:55.720" style="s2">up information from the past and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.070" end="00:22:58.840" style="s2">has been this has been part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.720" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">debate from the beginning right and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.840" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">issues earlier and we&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:06.150" style="s2">talking about it sort of vaguely about</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:09.190" style="s2">you know that the gestalt tests were</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.150" end="00:23:11.140" style="s2">responding to or Megan others who were</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.190" end="00:23:12.280" style="s2">asserting that learning and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.140" end="00:23:15.070" style="s2">problem-solving which is merely</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.280" end="00:23:17.770" style="s2">extending or repeating the past into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.070" end="00:23:19.630" style="s2">present and the gestalt is contrasted</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.770" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">with how sometimes the passes actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.630" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">work forts or blinds you from solving a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:25.870" style="s2">problem that&#39;s how we gotten to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">some fixation things like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.870" end="00:23:30.460" style="s2">one sudden that happened was around the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">same time the 80s and it might be so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.460" end="00:23:34.690" style="s2">keep sort of moving in and out of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">point people were trying to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.690" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">more carefully the issue of transfer and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">problem-solving and what I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">you is that very quickly converge with</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">the work on insight problems over and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:54.310" style="s2">then then how that promote another sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:57.730" style="s2">of I guess it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.310" end="00:24:00.300" style="s2">philosophical reflection and critique by</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.730" end="00:24:00.300" style="s2">Weisberg</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.369" end="00:24:08.220" style="s2">first so that the best place to start is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.309" end="00:24:11.609" style="s2">a classic experiment that was only to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.220" end="00:24:16.350" style="s2">provoke the law of work more dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.609" end="00:24:17.509" style="s2">tale to the inside part solving some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.350" end="00:24:20.249" style="s2">you probably know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.509" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">so these famous is going up by David</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.249" end="00:24:31.080" style="s2">polio and 1980 assembly Oh to land the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:34.529" style="s2">arguments of a comet or explosion in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.080" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">chess game whatever that he also has as</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.529" end="00:24:37.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned before that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">most biking name I&#39;ve ever heard in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.710" end="00:24:46.769" style="s2">psychology now what was impressive about</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:52.549" style="s2">this experiment was how counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.769" end="00:24:57.570" style="s2">the result was it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.549" end="00:25:00.090" style="s2">heuristic in your scientific practice to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.570" end="00:25:03.899" style="s2">pay more attention to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.090" end="00:25:06.899" style="s2">intuitive results rather than simply</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.899" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">intuitive results it&#39;s counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.899" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">and results often mean that we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:14.489" style="s2">structured the experiment such so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:18.690" style="s2">it is confirms of about theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.489" end="00:25:21.499" style="s2">Odyssey etc etc and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.690" end="00:25:21.499" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.610" end="00:25:27.860" style="s2">so the heuristic is on an algorithm but</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.370" end="00:25:30.470" style="s2">it&#39;s generally a good idea to give more</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.860" end="00:25:34.519" style="s2">weight to counterintuitive results and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.470" end="00:25:38.630" style="s2">simply confirm insult now how would</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.519" end="00:25:41.779" style="s2">counterintuitive well it has to do where</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:44.019" style="s2">what seems like a pretty obvious and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.779" end="00:25:47.450" style="s2">what should be a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.019" end="00:25:49.730" style="s2">pedagogical type of intervention so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.450" end="00:25:52.970" style="s2">they did if they&#39;re going to use a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.730" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">problem is that to have experiment it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.970" end="00:25:55.909" style="s2">should very familiar with the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">radiation problem ever the vector</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.909" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">radiation problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.530" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">of experiment the participants were</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.130" end="00:26:27.510" style="s2">given a story to read they were given a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:32.659" style="s2">story to read and so it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.510" end="00:26:32.659" style="s2">right for this circuit here&#39;s a fortress</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.309" end="00:26:41.970" style="s2">and somebody once explained to me a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.299" end="00:26:43.880" style="s2">fortress it means it&#39;s or loyal to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.970" end="00:26:45.750" style="s2">fourth</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.880" end="00:26:48.860" style="s2">they often wondered what the difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.750" end="00:26:52.679" style="s2">between a fort and a door dress</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.860" end="00:26:54.750" style="s2">apparently this sort of loyal backing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.679" end="00:26:58.890" style="s2">a fortress and you just put up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.750" end="00:27:02.549" style="s2">anything to work so your kids can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.890" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">a fortress blanket and cardboard boxes</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.549" end="00:27:12.360" style="s2">become big report all right so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:14.610" style="s2">the fortress and there&#39;s a general who</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.360" end="00:27:18.299" style="s2">wants to attack the fortress the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.610" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">is and you can only access it to I tend</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.299" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">to call these cause of AIDS or they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">supposed to be certain you can only get</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:25.950" style="s2">to reply Road we could think about it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:28.230" style="s2">that they&#39;re cadres okay so you can only</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.950" end="00:27:30.360" style="s2">get to the fortress of all the causeways</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.230" end="00:27:32.730" style="s2">and the problem is there&#39;s a garrison</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.360" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">here and these guys are like the three</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.730" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">other Spartans like they will just</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:45.000" style="s2">defend and defendant defect okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:48.390" style="s2">probably general basis is like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:50.250" style="s2">marched on any one cause letting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.390" end="00:27:52.950" style="s2">garrison come little clouds and spend</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.250" end="00:27:55.559" style="s2">that causeway to the death and hold you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.950" end="00:27:58.169" style="s2">up long enough that you will your army</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.559" end="00:27:59.280" style="s2">will go out of supply and you will have</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.169" end="00:28:01.029" style="s2">to repeat by the way that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.280" end="00:28:03.639" style="s2">most important things to notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.029" end="00:28:07.539" style="s2">patience I find to make the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.639" end="00:28:10.209" style="s2">like go home supply because morale and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.539" end="00:28:12.809" style="s2">effectiveness drop really rapidly when</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.209" end="00:28:12.809" style="s2">people are hungry</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.129" end="00:28:23.889" style="s2">just in case chef in charge of a large</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.629" end="00:28:26.909" style="s2">army okay so what did the general do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.889" end="00:28:31.389" style="s2">general defiance is army up into four</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.909" end="00:28:35.489" style="s2">forces that then converge at the near</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.389" end="00:28:38.949" style="s2">point and you being what will happen is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.489" end="00:28:41.559" style="s2">the garrison right will come out and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.949" end="00:28:43.599" style="s2">walk one of the four that means</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.559" end="00:28:46.059" style="s2">three-quarters of his army will get into</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.599" end="00:28:50.949" style="s2">the city you know within an uncontested</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.059" end="00:28:54.429" style="s2">fashion so the idea here is the solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.949" end="00:28:57.999" style="s2">to the problem involves breaking up into</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.429" end="00:28:59.379" style="s2">multiple forces that converge on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.999" end="00:29:01.329" style="s2">point where they&#39;re needed at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.379" end="00:29:03.189" style="s2">requisite amount which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.329" end="00:29:06.039" style="s2">strongly analogous to what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.189" end="00:29:09.339" style="s2">do in the Ganga radiation problem okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.039" end="00:29:13.119" style="s2">so you show people this you make sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.339" end="00:29:15.189" style="s2">they understand what it is right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.119" end="00:29:18.189" style="s2">then you have an intervening distractor</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.189" end="00:29:27.699" style="s2">task right and they give them the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.189" end="00:29:29.619" style="s2">radiation problem now most people right</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.699" end="00:29:30.969" style="s2">so if we have a long history for people</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.619" end="00:29:33.099" style="s2">to do in some radiation problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.969" end="00:29:35.049" style="s2">encountered and so we know sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.099" end="00:29:37.239" style="s2">the spontaneous solution rate is on</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.049" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">average lived on the radiation top and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.239" end="00:29:40.869" style="s2">what they were expecting was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.669" style="s2">spontaneous solution rate in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.869" end="00:29:44.469" style="s2">version epinephrine radiation problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.669" end="00:29:46.839" style="s2">should be much higher than the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.469" end="00:29:50.019" style="s2">historical norm we should show evidence</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.839" end="00:29:55.029" style="s2">of significant facilitation from this to</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.999" end="00:30:43.249" style="s2">counterintuitive it was also very</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.799" end="00:30:45.859" style="s2">depressing because this was in 1980 and</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.109" end="00:31:14.749" style="s2">the course you will be sick with the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.279" end="00:31:15.889" style="s2">since watching that&#39;s the one we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.129" end="00:31:36.049" style="s2">depressing and there was a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.779" end="00:31:38.119" style="s2">use ditch and others were writing papers</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.049" end="00:31:39.799" style="s2">basically say look we&#39;re getting</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.330" end="00:32:48.270" style="s2">because they were then arguing that you</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.200" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">okay now technically in terms of the</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:37.190" style="s2">makes one a stage where being a sage is</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.950" end="00:41:49.910" style="s2">would be a fairly fairly useless of</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.910" end="00:41:57.610" style="s2">if you go in what James was talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.980" end="00:42:01.220" style="s2">about is he talking about the skills of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.610" end="00:42:02.900" style="s2">appropriate conceptualization is he</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.220" end="00:42:05.540" style="s2">means he&#39;s referring to the functions</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.540" end="00:42:13.700" style="s2">functions that people use right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.010" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">talking right so what what we would now</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.700" end="00:42:18.340" style="s2">call in terms of what the cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.589" end="00:42:33.219" style="s2">in that sense he&#39;s talking about a</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.979" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">more accurate is talking about a</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:25.630" style="s2">go back to the two things that we use</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:07.590" style="s2">what you have to do get to comprehend</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.480" end="00:44:37.150" style="s2">because you can use the same</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">processing theory memory I got the work</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.360" end="00:45:37.160" style="s2">of Bob Walker born here when I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:37.160" style="s2">this way back in my teens model okay so</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:46.860" style="s2">um what a reason is well maybe what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.420" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and think about how this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.860" end="00:45:50.670" style="s2">is relevant to what dominoes he said</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.990" end="00:45:52.860" style="s2">about Castleman admire what we said</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.670" end="00:45:55.800" style="s2">about lyra precedent in islamabad for</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.860" end="00:45:58.320" style="s2">now but what&#39;s going on what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.800" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">for transfer to occur it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.320" end="00:46:01.860" style="s2">procedural similarity propositional</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:03.600" style="s2">similarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.860" end="00:46:05.550" style="s2">now this is going to turn out to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.600" end="00:46:07.230" style="s2">been a very difficult I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.550" end="00:46:08.970" style="s2">think you realize that initially at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.230" end="00:46:11.270" style="s2">time to visit the visit particularly</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.970" end="00:46:13.260" style="s2">honest and waiting for Bob Walker to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.270" end="00:46:14.940" style="s2">because this is going to line up the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.260" end="00:46:17.700" style="s2">transfer appropriate processing which</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.940" end="00:46:19.740" style="s2">was the theory of memory transfer that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.700" end="00:46:24.270" style="s2">actually brought down history of levels</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.740" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">of processing so good on it into I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.270" end="00:46:29.070" style="s2">believe my other book if the universe</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:33.150" style="s2">and I just hang on in a link more sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.070" end="00:46:37.340" style="s2">in a few minutes okay so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.150" end="00:46:40.860" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here right might not be</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.340" end="00:46:44.730" style="s2">propositional similarity what procedural</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.860" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">similarity now is that the chase right</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.730" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">how do we catch that and then he for</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">with a link this the idea that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:56.370" style="s2">problem solving involves much more sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:46:58.110" style="s2">of procedural processing than</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.370" end="00:47:00.780" style="s2">propositional processing so you put the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.110" end="00:47:02.430" style="s2">two together and an experiment around</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.780" end="00:47:03.730" style="s2">the problem they called the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.430" end="00:47:05.810" style="s2">marriage</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.730" end="00:47:10.430" style="s2">the multiple marriage problem is</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.810" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">designed to break really trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.430" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">sure that the issue is not any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:20.540" style="s2">lack of relevant knowledge so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:21.860" style="s2">let&#39;s first of all take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.540" end="00:47:23.870" style="s2">problem and we&#39;ll talk about it they</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.860" end="00:47:25.400" style="s2">will talk about the will take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.870" end="00:47:26.840" style="s2">the problem I&#39;ll just briefly make sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.400" end="00:47:28.310" style="s2">you understand it it will didn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.840" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">will come back at how it was using all</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.310" end="00:47:35.510" style="s2">this experience okay okay so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:38.120" style="s2">literally from experiment a man who</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.510" end="00:47:40.790" style="s2">lived in a small town very 20 different</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.120" end="00:47:43.070" style="s2">women of the same town all they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.790" end="00:47:47.500" style="s2">living and you never divorce any of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.070" end="00:47:47.500" style="s2">yes you broke no law can you explain it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.770" end="00:47:52.520" style="s2">so things you might think oh this this</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.420" end="00:47:56.270" style="s2">is in Utah that&#39;s irrelevant by the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.520" end="00:48:00.190" style="s2">to be will in Utah right alien abduction</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.270" end="00:48:00.190" style="s2">the term trouble I not allowed answers</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.220" end="00:48:11.480" style="s2">really yeah why should you on this and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.140" end="00:48:17.420" style="s2">why did you go home because it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.480" end="00:48:19.370" style="s2">be like oh okay now I hope that this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.420" end="00:48:23.330" style="s2">not a revelation to any of you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.370" end="00:48:26.090" style="s2">like you mean clergymen can marry people</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.330" end="00:48:28.130" style="s2">like you knew that right that&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.090" end="00:48:30.770" style="s2">Oh in fact it&#39;s kind of a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.130" end="00:48:33.650" style="s2">thing we associated nowadays with clergy</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.770" end="00:48:39.260" style="s2">member 30 people what was actually going</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.650" end="00:48:43.820" style="s2">on right is you have to shift from two</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:46.190" style="s2">different meanings of bearing right you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.820" end="00:48:49.160" style="s2">have to shift from dominant and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.190" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">therefore initially salient interpret</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.160" end="00:48:53.900" style="s2">meaning to a legitimate but stopped</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:56.330" style="s2">dominant and therefore not initially</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.900" end="00:48:59.870" style="s2">sanlian meaning so what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.330" end="00:49:02.360" style="s2">is shift your attention and we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.870" end="00:49:04.610" style="s2">figure what is salient to you those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:08.710" style="s2">the cognitive operations that involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.610" end="00:49:08.710" style="s2">in the multiple parrots problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.750" end="00:49:14.069" style="s2">now that that&#39;s pretty cool because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.210" end="00:49:16.950" style="s2">such a simple process on the base right</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.069" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">and because people you get is not like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.950" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">the $9.00 is a real big change that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.930" end="00:49:23.730" style="s2">people won&#39;t solve it which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">problematic given out of time almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.730" end="00:49:26.849" style="s2">everybody solved the multiple very</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:30.390" style="s2">problem like within an experimental</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.849" end="00:49:32.460" style="s2">conference okay so these are all good</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.390" end="00:49:35.780" style="s2">design features so we&#39;ll take we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.460" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">back at 2:45 and we&#39;ll talk about right</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.780" end="00:49:41.309" style="s2">how they use the multiple marriage</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:45.089" style="s2">problem to make use of this the states</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.309" end="00:49:48.020" style="s2">in which we serve updated and not have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.089" end="00:49:50.250" style="s2">this overblown language to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.020" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">what happens in the sample radiation</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.250" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.069" end="00:50:04.660" style="s2">so the idea that the multiple marriage</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.930" end="00:50:07.630" style="s2">problem places sort of quite a demand on</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.660" end="00:50:09.339" style="s2">years to Cassidy to use James turn but</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.630" end="00:50:15.339" style="s2">very little command on your on your</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.339" end="00:50:18.099" style="s2">knowledge so that means it&#39;s fairly face</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.339" end="00:50:19.690" style="s2">to the sitting that failure to solve</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.099" end="00:50:29.289" style="s2">such a problem is not to a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.690" end="00:50:32.490" style="s2">knowledge and so what luck art and did</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.289" end="00:50:35.170" style="s2">was to try and set up a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.490" end="00:50:37.089" style="s2">initial task before being driven into</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.170" end="00:50:38.470" style="s2">the integral so the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.089" end="00:50:41.349" style="s2">experiment and such is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.470" end="00:50:42.789" style="s2">thing get against people some product is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.349" end="00:50:44.529" style="s2">going to be distractor and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.789" end="00:50:46.180" style="s2">going to give the inside body but</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.529" end="00:50:48.430" style="s2">instead of it because Association</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.180" end="00:50:51.010" style="s2">problem it is going to be the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.430" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">marriage problem but this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.010" end="00:51:00.279" style="s2">different this time</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">so this page dr. second here and getting</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.279" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">the multiple marriage problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.329" end="00:51:20.920" style="s2">here meaning we&#39;re dividing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.859" end="00:51:20.920" style="s2">participants into two groups right</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.369" end="00:51:30.440" style="s2">one group is getting the leading to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.650" end="00:51:32.180" style="s2">bunch of sentences sentences part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.440" end="00:51:33.710" style="s2">sentence is the target said all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.180" end="00:51:36.220" style="s2">other challenges in sentences are just</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.710" end="00:51:39.859" style="s2">there to mask what the servant attack</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.220" end="00:51:42.020" style="s2">the target sentence is like this it made</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.859" end="00:51:44.300" style="s2">the clergyman happy to marry several</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.020" end="00:51:47.030" style="s2">people each week so people would</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.300" end="00:51:48.829" style="s2">literally read the sentence they made</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.030" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">the clergyman happy to marry several</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.829" end="00:51:57.400" style="s2">people each week okay so they call that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:57.400" style="s2">declarative</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.420" end="00:52:07.530" style="s2">and then in contrast they had what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.340" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">called the puzzle form and this is done</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.530" end="00:52:12.930" style="s2">this is done on really basic to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:16.380" style="s2">computers of the time are not powerful</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.930" end="00:52:17.130" style="s2">machines I get it in this world</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.380" end="00:52:20.250" style="s2">regulator</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.130" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">okay and we this is what the Paulo forum</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.250" end="00:52:29.180" style="s2">look like again this would be a mint I</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:33.030" style="s2">missed a bunch of other sentences right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.180" end="00:52:35.370" style="s2">so the public forum was the merry sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.030" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">of demand married several people each</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.370" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">week because it made him happy then</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:44.610" style="s2">there is a pause Oz pause and then a few</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:48.030" style="s2">seconds later the word clergyman appears</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.610" end="00:52:49.740" style="s2">on the screen okay the man married</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.030" end="00:52:51.900" style="s2">several people each week because it made</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.740" end="00:52:55.620" style="s2">him happy follows a few seconds later by</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.900" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">the word clergyman okay before I go on</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.620" end="00:53:01.830" style="s2">to the results right okay so and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:03.990" style="s2">what you do is you have both groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.830" end="00:53:05.820" style="s2">given this unexpectedly and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.990" end="00:53:07.650" style="s2">looking to see this facilitation and one</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.820" end="00:53:10.500" style="s2">of the other before we talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.650" end="00:53:11.910" style="s2">a lot of points up the head because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.500" end="00:53:14.430" style="s2">going to go back to when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.910" end="00:53:17.750" style="s2">rollover shattering note that both of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.430" end="00:53:17.750" style="s2">these are verbal</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.170" end="00:53:31.019" style="s2">both of these are verbal language itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.079" end="00:53:34.829" style="s2">is is irrelevant factor both of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.019" end="00:53:38.549" style="s2">are verbal why do I say that because</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.829" end="00:53:42.749" style="s2">what happened was people who have this</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.749" end="00:53:48.719" style="s2">who have that shows significant</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.940" end="00:53:52.680" style="s2">facilitation for that even though the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.719" end="00:53:54.479" style="s2">content is almost exactly the same and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.680" end="00:53:56.969" style="s2">presumably you already possess the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.479" end="00:54:01.849" style="s2">content as you know of course even being</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.969" end="00:54:06.809" style="s2">ocean airing people this facilitate this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.849" end="00:54:08.339" style="s2">is different now</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.809" end="00:54:10.739" style="s2">there&#39;s two important things here that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.339" end="00:54:12.719" style="s2">tends to provide evidence we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.739" end="00:54:14.309" style="s2">see how this can complicated multiple</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.719" end="00:54:17.039" style="s2">other experiments so not just a simple</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.309" end="00:54:18.359" style="s2">experiment this tends to again I have an</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.039" end="00:54:21.660" style="s2">instan virgin evidence that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.359" end="00:54:24.359" style="s2">already seeing that insight is right</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.660" end="00:54:28.890" style="s2">perhaps more procedural than</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.359" end="00:54:31.890" style="s2">propositional in nature and also as I</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.890" end="00:54:32.460" style="s2">said I mean that language per se is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.890" end="00:54:35.549" style="s2">the issue</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.460" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">it is the kind of processing that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.549" end="00:54:44.789" style="s2">being triggered by the language that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:47.940" style="s2">held look if you think of burbled</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.789" end="00:54:49.979" style="s2">overshadowing is what drives or impairs</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.940" end="00:54:54.479" style="s2">insight you&#39;re in a lot of trouble here</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.979" end="00:55:00.390" style="s2">because we are both verbal and one</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.479" end="00:55:04.309" style="s2">clearly facilitates insight yes why does</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.390" end="00:55:06.210" style="s2">the second one you trigger procedure</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.309" end="00:55:09.180" style="s2">because what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.210" end="00:55:11.609" style="s2">the first one in the second one oh but</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.180" end="00:55:13.289" style="s2">this one what&#39;s your task what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.609" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">procedure with the cognitive operation</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.289" end="00:55:18.809" style="s2">you have to comprehend an existing story</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:20.430" style="s2">what you have to do is lack the hack</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.809" end="00:55:22.170" style="s2">should do the cognitive operation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.430" end="00:55:27.619" style="s2">shifting from the dominant to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.170" end="00:55:31.559" style="s2">sub-dominant meaning so the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.619" end="00:55:35.069" style="s2">both of these are right</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.559" end="00:55:37.410" style="s2">sexually or proposition we similar but</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.069" end="00:55:40.949" style="s2">this one is procedurally similar than</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.410" end="00:55:43.589" style="s2">this one isn&#39;t because in both disease</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.949" end="00:55:48.089" style="s2">is doing the same cognitive operation</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.589" end="00:55:50.759" style="s2">that answer your question so I should</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.089" end="00:55:52.890" style="s2">have made that sorry intelligence issues</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.759" end="00:55:55.009" style="s2">on that point first a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.890" end="00:55:59.430" style="s2">confusing to me you&#39;re going through yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.009" end="00:56:01.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s the key thing but they say as</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.430" end="00:56:02.579" style="s2">if I&#39;m putting it&#39;s just clear evidence</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.319" end="00:56:04.410" style="s2">that there&#39;s something wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.579" end="00:56:06.569" style="s2">notion of brutal overshadowing because</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.410" end="00:56:10.650" style="s2">it is not the use of language per se the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.569" end="00:56:12.029" style="s2">key issue I mean I have other things to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.650" end="00:56:14.130" style="s2">this I&#39;m just asking you to note that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.029" end="00:56:17.549" style="s2">this is not something that walks out</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.130" end="00:56:19.529" style="s2">laminin you are talking about think how</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.549" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">good it does the shoulder experiment is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.529" end="00:56:26.009" style="s2">four years down the road five years on</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:28.349" style="s2">the road I&#39;m going to show you other</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.009" end="00:56:31.619" style="s2">instances where it is clear to the case</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.349" end="00:56:33.829" style="s2">that language use per se is not the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.619" end="00:56:33.829" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.660" end="00:56:46.530" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.900" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.140" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">so that was really interesting and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.940" end="00:57:08.920" style="s2">got that never go on to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:10.780" style="s2">memory or indexing and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.920" end="00:57:12.790" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.780" end="00:57:15.210" style="s2">when we talk about ideas on incubation</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.790" end="00:57:17.410" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to put that aside for now</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.210" end="00:57:21.550" style="s2">instead what I want to do is follow up</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.410" end="00:57:24.790" style="s2">on from what one thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.550" end="00:57:26.260" style="s2">relatively rare in psychology compared</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.790" end="00:57:29.460" style="s2">to how much we talk about how important</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.260" end="00:57:29.460" style="s2">it is which is replication</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.070" end="00:58:02.780" style="s2">okay so I have been out same year 1988</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.780" end="00:58:04.730" style="s2">right people were asked to rate the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.780" end="00:58:06.860" style="s2">truth of statements presented in</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.730" end="00:58:08.900" style="s2">probably a more flat form so they had to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.860" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">read through a bunch of statements to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.900" end="00:58:14.150" style="s2">represent it in problem for more fat</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:16.700" style="s2">form and people had to evaluate whether</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.150" end="00:58:18.410" style="s2">or not percentages which were false so</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.700" end="00:58:21.500" style="s2">the problem for me is you can vary</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.410" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">several people each week if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.500" end="00:58:28.220" style="s2">minister the delay is just literally one</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:33.530" style="s2">clause away but you have to know what oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.220" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">right the platform is a minister marries</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.530" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">several people each week</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.480" end="00:58:47.460" style="s2">people read all these unders distractor</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.430" end="00:58:49.170" style="s2">task and then they were unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.460" end="00:58:52.830" style="s2">given the multiple marriage problem and</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.170" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">as you may have already given it away</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.830" end="00:58:58.650" style="s2">because it sent us replication what they</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:59:01.050" style="s2">found was right that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.650" end="00:59:02.460" style="s2">given the bubble forms of dislocation of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.050" end="00:59:12.110" style="s2">a multiple Derek&#39;s problem and people</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.460" end="00:59:16.530" style="s2">who are show the fact form is not now</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.110" end="00:59:20.790" style="s2">how did this relevant to that issue</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.530" end="00:59:27.630" style="s2">around Bob Walker honesty or at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.790" end="00:59:29.550" style="s2">integrity is so now a digression because</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.630" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">we haven&#39;t talked about transfer within</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.550" end="00:59:34.980" style="s2">memory if it&#39;s a Lockhart great and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:36.330" style="s2">Lockhart proposed expose filling your</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.980" end="00:59:38.190" style="s2">textbooks and probably still thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.330" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t even heard of levels of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.190" end="00:59:44.100" style="s2">processing remember okay how was</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:46.110" style="s2">uninterested sorry I don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.100" end="00:59:49.020" style="s2">creepy or anything how does it talk to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.110" end="00:59:49.860" style="s2">you like was it taught like this is how</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.020" end="00:59:54.090" style="s2">memory works</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.860" end="00:59:55.530" style="s2">how is levels of processing talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.090" end="00:59:59.900" style="s2">of you put up your hand some of you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.530" end="00:59:59.900" style="s2">somebody I thought an answer to it yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.279" end="01:00:08.999" style="s2">for an event there are other</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.060" end="01:00:18.580" style="s2">good so that&#39;s all done now that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.380" end="01:00:23.110" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I stated quite a</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.580" end="01:00:25.540" style="s2">while to sort of sat there so because so</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.110" end="01:00:28.480" style="s2">levels of processing was the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.540" end="01:00:29.800" style="s2">the more deeply or more semantically and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.480" end="01:00:31.360" style="s2">whether or not those are the same is</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.800" end="01:00:33.160" style="s2">part of the theoretical issue over the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.360" end="01:00:35.380" style="s2">pathetic side but the more people you</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.160" end="01:00:37.360" style="s2">process something the more likely you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.380" end="01:00:39.220" style="s2">are to remember it independent of your</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.360" end="01:00:41.080" style="s2">intention to remember it was a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.220" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">evidence that that depth of processing</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.080" end="01:00:47.050" style="s2">was predicted with how well you remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:49.600" style="s2">Bob Walker was one of the advocates of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.050" end="01:00:51.850" style="s2">one of the creators of that theory and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.600" end="01:00:53.680" style="s2">that the depth and some of the original</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.850" end="01:00:58.660" style="s2">experiments of levels and processing</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.680" end="01:01:02.560" style="s2">were designed by Bob Walker and now as</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.660" end="01:01:06.730" style="s2">was mentioned I Soviet Union Army yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.560" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">you know how I&#39;m getting it wrong I</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.730" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want it you know right as well Oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.510" end="01:01:28.550" style="s2">Marlina done i have death in one year so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.030" end="01:01:31.270" style="s2">that means it could skew how I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.550" end="01:01:36.770" style="s2">things from people all right I&#39;m sorry</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.770" end="01:01:41.030" style="s2">happened is the theory got overturned or</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.020" end="01:01:43.160" style="s2">be significantly challenged by what in</p>

<p begin="01:11:37.030" end="01:11:44.930" style="s2">okay so another like growing sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.650" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">convergent argument of what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.930" end="01:11:50.620" style="s2">thing is going on right inside</p>

<p begin="01:11:54.500" end="01:12:01.020" style="s2">so then this all came together in</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.210" end="01:12:02.790" style="s2">another counterintuitive experiment the</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.020" end="01:12:05.780" style="s2">counter include experimenters and again</p>

<p begin="01:12:06.050" end="01:12:17.220" style="s2">is this going okay for you guys the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.580" end="01:12:19.470" style="s2">arguments step by staff experiment and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.220" end="01:12:20.520" style="s2">then this will be into because we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:12:46.980" end="01:12:52.890" style="s2">in the morning now here&#39;s the startling</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.030" end="01:12:54.360" style="s2">thing most of the evidence shows that</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.890" end="01:12:56.360" style="s2">innovation at least the standard</p>

<p begin="01:13:01.050" end="01:13:07.100" style="s2">almost all of the claims of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.760" end="01:13:07.100" style="s2">romantics have to not be welcomed</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.739" end="01:13:14.289" style="s2">but the point do that is to this</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.449" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">counterintuitive thing about memory and</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.289" end="01:13:19.570" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:25.059" style="s2">so get and McGary thing getting yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.570" end="01:13:29.949" style="s2">let&#39;s work like it really responds that</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.059" end="01:13:35.349" style="s2">we should work we one thing us should be</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.949" end="01:13:36.879" style="s2">located now this is going to take a</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.349" end="01:13:38.289" style="s2">little bit of reasoning in your hand</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.879" end="01:13:39.369" style="s2">because it&#39;s counterintuitive you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.289" end="01:13:44.949" style="s2">going to experience that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.369" end="01:13:47.079" style="s2">counterintuitive okay let&#39;s just do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.949" end="01:13:49.059" style="s2">try to do it at the level of intuition</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.079" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">if you get it clear before we go back to</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.059" end="01:13:53.469" style="s2">the guards&#39;ll design okay so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:55.689" style="s2">trying to solve a problem that means</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.469" end="01:14:04.959" style="s2">right which means you&#39;re currently not</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.689" end="01:14:08.169" style="s2">solving it that okay that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.959" end="01:14:13.360" style="s2">to happen and like you oh how do I do</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.169" end="01:14:16.179" style="s2">the nine dots or or okay now see what</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.360" end="01:14:18.899" style="s2">this carefully but in terms of content</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.179" end="01:14:21.969" style="s2">but in terms of procedural similarity</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.899" end="01:14:24.070" style="s2">what kind of problems are most in your</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.969" end="01:14:26.280" style="s2">memory was procedurally similar to this</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.070" end="01:14:26.280" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.110" end="01:14:32.010" style="s2">other problems that you&#39;ve been passed</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.880" end="01:14:34.619" style="s2">on that you have wrought they hit an</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.010" end="01:14:38.270" style="s2">impasse on so other in past problems are</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.619" end="01:14:38.270" style="s2">more procedurally similar</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.599" end="01:15:05.099" style="s2">well present that like it could be it</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.199" end="01:15:07.409" style="s2">could be this is Rita which right issues</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.099" end="01:15:10.050" style="s2">like cognitive flexibility that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.409" end="01:15:10.920" style="s2">popular one more I hope one was the</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.050" end="01:15:12.989" style="s2">vehicle going on</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.920" end="01:15:15.239" style="s2">then we clinched the area of the main</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.989" end="01:15:17.820" style="s2">general aspects of them and agree to is</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.239" end="01:15:19.800" style="s2">there the main specific aspects of by</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.820" end="01:15:21.900" style="s2">the way that&#39;s a really good topic that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.800" end="01:15:24.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t want sixty versions of this for</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.900" end="01:15:26.400" style="s2">and as the audience are problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.179" end="01:15:28.199" style="s2">the degree to which we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.400" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">the main general aspects of insight</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.199" end="01:15:33.510" style="s2">versus the main specific okay therefore</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:35.599" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about it in this</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.510" end="01:15:39.119" style="s2">experiment in a domain general way</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.599" end="01:15:41.460" style="s2">whether or not this experiment licenses</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.119" end="01:15:46.230" style="s2">main conclusion for the main generality</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.460" end="01:15:49.800" style="s2">that&#39;s another issue okay so what give</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.230" end="01:15:52.530" style="s2">you McGarry argue is but what would</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.800" end="01:15:56.630" style="s2">actually facilitate you solving this</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.530" end="01:15:59.820" style="s2">problem is to have a history of failures</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.630" end="01:16:02.489" style="s2">it&#39;s done kind of intuitive it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.820" end="01:16:04.409" style="s2">but those are failures why would I pay</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.489" end="01:16:06.389" style="s2">attention to my pocket failures and how</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.409" end="01:16:09.980" style="s2">could they possibly help me now what I</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.389" end="01:16:09.980" style="s2">should do is think of my past successes</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.260" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">we don&#39;t like to look back at our past</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.399" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">others but think about it when I have</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:32.449" style="s2">all of these failures</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:35.110" style="s2">what can I apply to them and notice of</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.449" end="01:16:35.110" style="s2">their interest</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.690" end="01:16:45.590" style="s2">the idea is apply to notice</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.550" end="01:16:48.580" style="s2">adventurously and that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.590" end="01:16:51.260" style="s2">actually need in order to facilitate</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.580" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">solving a problem so this is the very</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.260" end="01:16:54.530" style="s2">certain contour to it because what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:58.490" style="s2">tend to do is we tend to look back at</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.530" end="01:17:01.160" style="s2">our previous call solutions right the</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.490" end="01:17:03.410" style="s2">difficulty with that is that they tend</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.160" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">to be similar to the wrong plate that</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.410" end="01:17:08.150" style="s2">can be similar in being solutions and</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:13.090" style="s2">not similarity and giving us a basis for</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.150" end="01:17:13.090" style="s2">how to solve from the unsolved problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.200" end="01:17:22.520" style="s2">so very counterintuitive proposal so how</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.620" end="01:17:27.620" style="s2">does they view this how would they</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.520" end="01:17:29.030" style="s2">induce failures in people and then how</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.620" end="01:17:30.740" style="s2">do they test it well what they did would</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.030" end="01:17:34.160" style="s2">they do variations on a mutilated</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.740" end="01:17:37.010" style="s2">chessboard remember I said that you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.160" end="01:17:40.280" style="s2">in terms of statistics you can vary how</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.010" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">difficult the problem is by varying how</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.280" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">salient you make the parity cube</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.130" end="01:17:56.100" style="s2">and so they did it analogous problems</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:57.900" style="s2">like that immediately analysis and what</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.100" end="01:18:00.719" style="s2">they did was they gave people a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.900" end="01:18:03.480" style="s2">problems that were difficult that were</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.719" end="01:18:05.460" style="s2">not solvable they force people well</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.480" end="01:18:07.590" style="s2">mostly because it statistically some</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.460" end="01:18:10.350" style="s2">people are not going to are not going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.590" end="01:18:15.390" style="s2">be forced but they created a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.350" end="01:18:18.360" style="s2">failures what they call source solution</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.390" end="01:18:20.489" style="s2">builders and what they found is if I</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.360" end="01:18:22.830" style="s2">give you more source solution failures</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.489" end="01:18:24.300" style="s2">are more likely to solve the mutilating</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.830" end="01:18:28.380" style="s2">chessboard that means you have fewer</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.300" end="01:18:30.570" style="s2">source solution failures because if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.380" end="01:18:32.340" style="s2">have more you can apply the newest</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.570" end="01:18:36.150" style="s2">degree of variance heuristic pattern</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.340" end="01:18:39.900" style="s2">that if you have fewer so more source</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.150" end="01:18:42.210" style="s2">solution failures to survey the insight</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.900" end="01:18:46.560" style="s2">the spontaneous the insight for solving</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.210" end="01:18:48.060" style="s2">the mutilated chessboard the next comes</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.560" end="01:18:49.590" style="s2">really counterintuitive right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.060" end="01:18:55.110" style="s2">the hole which I mean all of my</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.590" end="01:18:57.000" style="s2">successes should matter but it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.110" end="01:19:00.150" style="s2">it&#39;s gone in and out it&#39;s kind of now on</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.000" end="01:19:02.489" style="s2">like a developmental psychology right so</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.150" end="01:19:04.110" style="s2">Piaget was the first person to wonder it</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.489" end="01:19:05.969" style="s2">whether or not the errors on</p>

<p begin="01:19:16.530" end="01:19:22.199" style="s2">here is if there&#39;s systematicity in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.380" end="01:19:24.900" style="s2">errors if you have more source solution</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.199" end="01:19:26.340" style="s2">errors then the notice invariance</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.900" end="01:19:29.880" style="s2">heuristic can operate and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.340" end="01:19:33.780" style="s2">facilitates insight now this is the kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.880" end="01:19:35.670" style="s2">of a weird possible consequence which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.780" end="01:19:39.210" style="s2">something that is often been very</p>

<p begin="01:20:50.690" end="01:20:55.370" style="s2">works and that insight seems to involve</p>

<p begin="01:20:55.370" end="01:21:00.980" style="s2">automaticity</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.330" end="01:21:02.830" style="s2">I want you to remember this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.980" end="01:21:05.450" style="s2">automaticity for two important reasons</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.830" end="01:21:07.630" style="s2">automaticity is a way of procedurally</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.450" end="01:21:10.760" style="s2">talking about what a constraint it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.630" end="01:21:13.730" style="s2">opposed to proposition lee in terms of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.760" end="01:21:16.310" style="s2">rule in fact that I just note it down</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.730" end="01:21:18.590" style="s2">this will make the connection backward</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.310" end="01:21:20.660" style="s2">is a connection between automaticity and</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.590" end="01:21:23.120" style="s2">a procedural understanding of what a</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.660" end="01:21:26.300" style="s2">constraint is rather than a proposition</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.120" end="01:21:28.490" style="s2">will understand secondly we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.300" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">to this as well but I try to Porsche out</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.490" end="01:21:32.390" style="s2">of these connections so you can regale</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:34.700" style="s2">it in the back later a lot of us going</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.390" end="01:21:37.100" style="s2">on recently will work as tang and others</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.700" end="01:21:38.900" style="s2">and mindfulness is that mindfulness but</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.100" end="01:21:40.790" style="s2">this goes back to an old proposal by</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.900" end="01:21:44.240" style="s2">document that mindfulness training is</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.790" end="01:21:52.450" style="s2">basically training in the automatisation</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.240" end="01:21:52.450" style="s2">the organization coefficient - yes so</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.510" end="01:22:00.590" style="s2">automaticity is procedural but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.040" end="01:22:05.660" style="s2">procedural how you get around and</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.590" end="01:22:09.220" style="s2">gentlemen sure so so automaticity in</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.660" end="01:22:11.960" style="s2">health Alton no no no no automaticity</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.220" end="01:22:14.510" style="s2">the fact that insight is procedural and</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.960" end="01:22:15.950" style="s2">automaticity is insight sort it is also</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.510" end="01:22:17.720" style="s2">procedural just means that they both</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.950" end="01:22:20.600" style="s2">belong to the class of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.720" end="01:22:23.570" style="s2">procedural in nature so what law heart</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.600" end="01:22:25.130" style="s2">is saying is that insight as something</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.570" end="01:22:27.680" style="s2">that is procedural that helps you to</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.130" end="01:22:33.080" style="s2">counteract the procedural constraints of</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.680" end="01:22:35.540" style="s2">automaticity we&#39;re going to need this</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.080" end="01:22:38.360" style="s2">when we talked about both mindfulness as</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.540" end="01:22:40.190" style="s2">via monetization and when we talked</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.360" end="01:22:46.100" style="s2">about what is meant by constraint</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.190" end="01:22:50.120" style="s2">relaxation constraint relaxation a</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.100" end="01:22:51.530" style="s2">positive way understanding with kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.120" end="01:22:53.960" style="s2">foreshadow is a positive way of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.530" end="01:22:56.240" style="s2">understanding what constraint relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.960" end="01:23:02.030" style="s2">is is to understand it at the D</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.240" end="01:23:03.470" style="s2">organization of your process alright now</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.030" end="01:23:05.240" style="s2">I have been justified in you exclaims</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.470" end="01:23:08.540" style="s2">I&#39;m just foreshadowing this connection</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.240" end="01:23:13.840" style="s2">there okay there&#39;s a connection made</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.540" end="01:23:17.060" style="s2">between like authenticity and insight by</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.840" end="01:23:18.650" style="s2">five eight one heart that was going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.060" end="01:23:20.930" style="s2">be prescient about what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.650" end="01:23:22.970" style="s2">talk about later in mindfulness and when</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.930" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">we talk about our constraint relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.970" end="01:23:27.550" style="s2">and in said problem solving the world is</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:27.550" style="s2">not work and others</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:35.739" style="s2">okay so this idea now of facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.440" end="01:23:39.630" style="s2">transfer is now crucial and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.739" end="01:23:39.630" style="s2">going to take another line of evidence</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.719" end="01:23:44.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.030" end="01:23:47.969" style="s2">independent work done on incubation</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.760" end="01:23:50.980" style="s2">because that seems to be a memory</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.969" end="01:23:54.580" style="s2">facilitation of transfer for reporting</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.980" end="01:23:58.660" style="s2">insight thing incubation is like</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.580" end="01:24:01.270" style="s2">foreshadow what I try to do is show you</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.660" end="01:24:05.739" style="s2">that in that many different lines of</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.270" end="01:24:07.989" style="s2">theorizing and experimental evidence are</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.739" end="01:24:11.050" style="s2">all converging on this idea about what</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.989" end="01:24:13.989" style="s2">kind of processing insight is because</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.050" end="01:24:16.300" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do is do what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.989" end="01:24:19.690" style="s2">result is and not done very well which</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.300" end="01:24:22.030" style="s2">is try to build up a base of constructs</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.690" end="01:24:23.860" style="s2">that are independently established that</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.030" end="01:24:27.130" style="s2">will allow us to come up with an</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.860" end="01:24:29.140" style="s2">alternative explanation for insight that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.130" end="01:24:35.710" style="s2">I think transcends both the gestalt this</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.140" end="01:24:39.450" style="s2">and the computational framework well</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.710" end="01:24:39.450" style="s2">we&#39;re at work we&#39;re only going up with</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.630" end="01:24:55.909" style="s2">all right so incue bation so just again</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.420" end="01:24:57.639" style="s2">in the popular notion this is like sleep</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.909" end="01:24:59.599" style="s2">on it or stop thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.639" end="01:25:02.570" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s that little</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.599" end="01:25:04.729" style="s2">analytic pathology runners that your</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.570" end="01:25:08.150" style="s2">unconscious will work on the problem and</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.729" end="01:25:12.050" style="s2">solve it and do things and their stories</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.150" end="01:25:14.300" style="s2">to be there about people in dreams</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.050" end="01:25:17.329" style="s2">having important insights to solve</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.300" end="01:25:19.219" style="s2">problems that they couldn&#39;t solve one of</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.219" end="01:25:23.570" style="s2">this that people write on is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.929" end="01:25:27.709" style="s2">connection to clean cleaning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.570" end="01:25:29.749" style="s2">like goods are especially re-entering</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.709" end="01:25:36.800" style="s2">because non REM dreams tend to be really</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.749" end="01:25:40.119" style="s2">worked or like you&#39;re eating soup right</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.800" end="01:25:41.300" style="s2">what are you doing I was leaving soup</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.119" end="01:25:43.190" style="s2">rem-3</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.300" end="01:25:46.309" style="s2">I was writing a purple dragon in the</p>

<p begin="01:25:46.309" end="01:25:50.630" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s connections between that</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.979" end="01:25:52.400" style="s2">results have been some recent research</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.630" end="01:25:56.959" style="s2">on connections between lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.400" end="01:25:58.729" style="s2">and insight all of this is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.959" end="01:26:01.010" style="s2">because does like credence to certain</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.729" end="01:26:02.599" style="s2">traditional claims about certain kinds</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.010" end="01:26:05.119" style="s2">of induced altered states of</p>

<p begin="01:26:11.150" end="01:26:17.510" style="s2">and now these are coming to show that</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.750" end="01:26:22.580" style="s2">probably true at least good evidence for</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.510" end="01:26:28.400" style="s2">it alright so incubation sits within</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.580" end="01:26:38.570" style="s2">that whole sort of idea and he goes back</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.400" end="01:26:40.250" style="s2">to a book from 1926 right it&#39;s called I</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.570" end="01:26:42.380" style="s2">can&#39;t remember how we as you go back</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.250" end="01:26:44.570" style="s2">further in time to the title see for the</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.380" end="01:26:49.280" style="s2">ideas this is the pedal move up by</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.570" end="01:26:51.170" style="s2">wallets wal L is Wallace this is what if</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.280" end="01:26:54.980" style="s2">this whole idea was introduced the title</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.170" end="01:26:59.480" style="s2">of the book is the art of thought the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.980" end="01:27:01.400" style="s2">fact through way mental is how to</p>

<p begin="01:27:01.400" end="01:27:06.290" style="s2">argue that there were four phases in</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:10.849" style="s2">innovative problem solving and</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.290" end="01:27:12.440" style="s2">creativity and we&#39;ll talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.849" end="01:27:14.810" style="s2">that those are often overlapping with</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.440" end="01:27:17.630" style="s2">insight problem solving here are the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.810" end="01:27:19.250" style="s2">four phases mental preparation is where</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.630" end="01:27:22.610" style="s2">you&#39;re working on the problem and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.250" end="01:27:24.889" style="s2">don&#39;t solve it you keep working on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.610" end="01:27:28.489" style="s2">problem and keep working on it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.889" end="01:27:30.530" style="s2">unsuccessful and then incubation putting</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.489" end="01:27:37.580" style="s2">the problem aside and working on other</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.530" end="01:27:42.139" style="s2">things and I like the next but the name</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.139" end="01:27:47.920" style="s2">but blasted ends like unexpectedly</p>

<p begin="01:27:47.920" end="01:27:52.870" style="s2">illuminated sounds delicious right</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.790" end="01:27:58.240" style="s2">illumination it&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.870" end="01:28:00.730" style="s2">I fumbled one and then the last state is</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.240" end="01:28:02.620" style="s2">verification working of the veto</p>

<p begin="01:28:04.890" end="01:28:11.320" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s what is different with it</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.010" end="01:28:14.860" style="s2">this is an old old idea and keeps</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.320" end="01:28:18.510" style="s2">getting product out as the solution to</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.860" end="01:28:21.510" style="s2">making me better better problem-solver</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.510" end="01:28:21.510" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.540" end="01:28:36.190" style="s2">1946 during the Roaring Twenties seem to</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.300" end="01:28:38.380" style="s2">be true when you forget we stopped</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.190" end="01:28:40.300" style="s2">anyone for a second and eventually what</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.380" end="01:28:41.440" style="s2">rain will retreat back back what you</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.300" end="01:28:43.750" style="s2">just said was great</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.440" end="01:28:45.580" style="s2">we&#39;re going to come back to this right</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.750" end="01:28:47.710" style="s2">so whatever saying is maybe it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.580" end="01:28:50.680" style="s2">condition or the unconsciously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.710" end="01:28:53.560" style="s2">magical indiscreet workers may be what</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.680" end="01:28:55.090" style="s2">it is right is that you forget certain</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.560" end="01:28:57.090" style="s2">things that when you come back that just</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.090" end="01:29:00.430" style="s2">means you bleep on delay to the problem</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.090" end="01:29:02.890" style="s2">to selectively forgetting hypothesis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.430" end="01:29:04.540" style="s2">going to take a look at this what do you</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.890" end="01:29:06.130" style="s2">can do just a poor shadow we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.540" end="01:29:08.200" style="s2">do this more vigorously by looking at</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.130" end="01:29:09.760" style="s2">the experiment to detail but this is an</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.200" end="01:29:11.980" style="s2">answer to Emma what are the things you</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.760" end="01:29:15.130" style="s2">could do is incubations right that time</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.980" end="01:29:17.140" style="s2">away should matter if what matters is</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.130" end="01:29:22.750" style="s2">just a restructuring of attention then</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.140" end="01:29:24.640" style="s2">very brief wait as read interventions</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.750" end="01:29:27.240" style="s2">that cause you to restructure would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.640" end="01:29:31.690" style="s2">better than lots of time away and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.240" end="01:29:35.010" style="s2">protected that&#39;s actually tastes so good</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.690" end="01:29:35.010" style="s2">idea we&#39;ll come back to it okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.990" end="01:29:46.650" style="s2">okay now there&#39;s sort of three views so</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.390" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2">what sort of we&#39;re going to take a look</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.650" end="01:29:58.080" style="s2">at the works by seaport and out in</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.400" end="01:30:00.060" style="s2">secret at 1995 on the connections</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.080" end="01:30:01.680" style="s2">between insight and innovation either</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.060" end="01:30:04.200" style="s2">you are going to be to struggling to you</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.680" end="01:30:06.180" style="s2">but they present three views as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.200" end="01:30:07.950" style="s2">to the two and they do that because</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.180" end="01:30:11.610" style="s2">they&#39;re doing this is interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.950" end="01:30:14.870" style="s2">slightly manipulative rhetorically it</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.610" end="01:30:17.220" style="s2">goes back to Aristotle that most of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.870" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">interesting but slightly manipulative</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.220" end="01:30:22.920" style="s2">use we&#39;re all better fighters level ok</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:25.290" style="s2">so there&#39;s three perspectives on insight</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.920" end="01:30:26.660" style="s2">and therefore on incubation they call</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.290" end="01:30:28.590" style="s2">the first one the business-as-usual</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.660" end="01:30:31.650" style="s2">perspective which is already comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.590" end="01:30:33.960" style="s2">and people who typify that of course</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.650" end="01:30:35.940" style="s2">Weisberg evolve up and even although</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.960" end="01:30:37.620" style="s2">they make changes Kaplan and Taemin are</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.940" end="01:30:39.390" style="s2">trying to say it&#39;s business as usual</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.620" end="01:30:44.460" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing importantly different</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.390" end="01:30:47.780" style="s2">going on here the second perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.460" end="01:30:50.100" style="s2">I don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.780" end="01:30:52.440" style="s2">this is the name they give it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.100" end="01:30:58.350" style="s2">know how they call it the wizard Merlin</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.440" end="01:31:00.480" style="s2">perspective so the volition the wizard</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.350" end="01:31:03.920" style="s2">learning perspective is insight occurs</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.480" end="01:31:06.060" style="s2">his results are absolutely spectacular</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.920" end="01:31:08.280" style="s2">the results are produced by sort of</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.060" end="01:31:09.540" style="s2">superhuman and strange mental powers</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.280" end="01:31:12.210" style="s2">would operate in an unpredictable</p>

<p begin="01:31:21.810" end="01:31:24.600" style="s2">would be a guard</p>

<p begin="01:31:26.869" end="01:31:33.429" style="s2">the fact is you use most of your brain</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.050" end="01:31:36.440" style="s2">most of the time for most of the tasks</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.429" end="01:31:38.510" style="s2">the one time for image using a hundred</p>

<p begin="01:31:46.070" end="01:31:52.040" style="s2">and all that stuff is really kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.960" end="01:31:57.760" style="s2">trapped in fact higher IQs are predicted</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.040" end="01:31:57.760" style="s2">of lower cortical activation not more</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.340" end="01:32:10.360" style="s2">let interlac we still let romanticism</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.500" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">for reasons that are obscure to me okay</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.360" end="01:32:16.880" style="s2">so some people will talk about that a</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:20.020" style="s2">person is often trotted out as an</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.880" end="01:32:23.679" style="s2">example of this is Richard Feynman</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.020" end="01:32:28.280" style="s2">Richard Feynman had a reputation for</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.679" end="01:32:30.080" style="s2">revealed to do this people would present</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.280" end="01:32:31.969" style="s2">problems Department and the other sort</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.080" end="01:32:35.719" style="s2">of drama that you would go to and get</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.969" end="01:32:38.330" style="s2">almost pain that he would sort of up and</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.719" end="01:32:41.060" style="s2">then he blurted out something and people</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.330" end="01:32:43.159" style="s2">would go oh my god that he broke my god</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.060" end="01:32:46.040" style="s2">then reformulate their game of it with</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.159" end="01:32:47.360" style="s2">what the colors he do this and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.040" end="01:32:49.969" style="s2">want to take anything away from my</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.360" end="01:32:52.130" style="s2">minute I&#39;m not sure this but after he</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.969" end="01:32:53.659" style="s2">died they went through like his desk in</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.130" end="01:33:01.400" style="s2">a notebook he was working on these</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.659" end="01:33:03.980" style="s2">problems a lot no so some of the magic</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.400" end="01:33:06.500" style="s2">industry was but he was a Madonna of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.980" end="01:33:08.389" style="s2">academic world he was really good at</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.500" end="01:33:10.099" style="s2">marketing himself and presenting himself</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.389" end="01:33:13.639" style="s2">as having talent that he might not</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.099" end="01:33:15.560" style="s2">actually have fishing Idol talent so so</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.639" end="01:33:17.090" style="s2">well propellant was - presented yourself</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.560" end="01:33:18.000" style="s2">in such a way so that people just stick</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.090" end="01:33:20.080" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.000" end="01:33:22.120" style="s2">which is why her material is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.080" end="01:33:34.120" style="s2">disappearing from the common repertoire</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.120" end="01:33:37.750" style="s2">already really rapid what I meant</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.120" end="01:33:40.890" style="s2">right also shouldn&#39;t be totally put</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.750" end="01:33:43.990" style="s2">aside because and he at least foresaw</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.890" end="01:33:46.000" style="s2">the kinds of problems that were going to</p>

<p begin="01:33:48.610" end="01:33:53.710" style="s2">that we would actually get to a game</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.650" end="01:33:56.140" style="s2">sight stage so that when he was ready he</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.710" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">so people asked him he was ready and he</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.140" end="01:34:05.920" style="s2">had the inside ready to go so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:08.850" style="s2">kind of dodgy on his part but on the</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.920" end="01:34:10.660" style="s2">other hand it doesn&#39;t mean they know</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.850" end="01:34:12.760" style="s2">something was going on there that was</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.660" end="01:34:14.740" style="s2">interesting so the wizard Merlin</p>

<p begin="01:34:14.740" end="01:34:22.270" style="s2">insight is the opposite of the business</p>

<p begin="01:34:42.400" end="01:34:47.350" style="s2">use it rhetorically right it goes back</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.890" end="01:34:49.000" style="s2">to aerosol right you present the two</p>

<p begin="01:42:06.620" end="01:42:13.790" style="s2">says in 1995 a scarcity of replicable</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.460" end="01:42:17.199" style="s2">incubation effects so although this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.790" end="01:42:19.429" style="s2">why we believe the attempt to find good</p>

<p begin="01:42:19.429" end="01:42:22.810" style="s2">has largely failed</p>

<p begin="01:42:46.670" end="01:42:50.480" style="s2">replicated and you have this massive</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.410" end="01:42:53.630" style="s2">sort of popular belief in each occasion</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.480" end="01:42:55.520" style="s2">and it you know absolutely no part of</p>

<p begin="01:42:55.520" end="01:43:00.640" style="s2">lots of popular beliefs a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.520" end="01:43:03.560" style="s2">right that sort of is not be true right</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.640" end="01:43:08.410" style="s2">absolutely science is the largest amount</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.560" end="01:43:12.440" style="s2">of positivity trouble a lot of issues</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.410" end="01:43:14.719" style="s2">turn out alright but there&#39;s something a</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.440" end="01:43:16.580" style="s2">little bit more when notice Smith</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.719" end="01:43:18.170" style="s2">language it&#39;s important language and</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.580" end="01:43:21.400" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying is importantly he said</p>

<p begin="01:43:21.400" end="01:43:25.550" style="s2">replicable so there would be that what</p>

<p begin="01:43:25.550" end="01:43:29.210" style="s2">what looks like confirmation here and</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.890" end="01:43:31.130" style="s2">then when people try to replicate it</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.210" end="01:43:32.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not there and then people get it</p>

<p begin="01:43:32.840" end="01:43:38.030" style="s2">here now again one response to that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.410" end="01:43:39.920" style="s2">well this is the same thing with psychic</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.030" end="01:43:41.810" style="s2">phenomena we can never get drop the</p>

<p begin="01:43:41.810" end="01:43:45.800" style="s2">sort of been coming to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.550" end="01:43:47.849" style="s2">again against popular belief is it</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.800" end="01:43:55.290" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t anything quite expected</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.849" end="01:43:57.300" style="s2">right so but keeping it out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.290" end="01:43:59.010" style="s2">another alternative you can say with</p>

<p begin="01:46:18.610" end="01:46:25.119" style="s2">like probably the pelvis in a progress</p>

<p begin="01:46:36.789" end="01:46:44.320" style="s2">the book and put her name on okay</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.250" end="01:46:46.300" style="s2">that&#39;s almost as dark and twisted as one</p>

<p begin="01:47:34.880" end="01:47:46.170" style="s2">facilitation hypothesis so the idea here</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.870" end="01:47:48.630" style="s2">is you&#39;re processing encountered an</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.170" end="01:47:50.760" style="s2">impasse which produces a failure index</p>

<p begin="01:47:50.760" end="01:47:54.930" style="s2">that has been unsolved by you and which</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.520" end="01:47:56.970" style="s2">is fearful of the introducing people</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.930" end="01:47:59.610" style="s2">like for another admission to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.970" end="01:48:02.280" style="s2">failure induction we can&#39;t solve the</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.610" end="01:48:05.670" style="s2">problem in some sense it is flagged in</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.280" end="01:48:07.380" style="s2">memory as an unsolved problem which</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.670" end="01:48:10.350" style="s2">could also help we give you the area</p>

<p begin="01:48:10.350" end="01:48:16.860" style="s2">heuristic so the idea is processing</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.600" end="01:48:19.280" style="s2">encounters and impasse which produces</p>

<p begin="01:48:19.280" end="01:48:25.770" style="s2">incubation involves a change of context</p>

<p begin="01:48:25.770" end="01:48:31.340" style="s2">and this change of context produces a</p>

<p begin="01:48:38.580" end="01:48:43.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay I can pull it out yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.170" end="01:48:46.480" style="s2">okay sure so the change of context</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.900" end="01:48:48.219" style="s2">produces or fortuitous encounter with</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.480" end="01:48:52.110" style="s2">the relevant information the information</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.219" end="01:48:58.989" style="s2">that you needed to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.110" end="01:49:01.300" style="s2">okay so you&#39;re in passing your brain</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.989" end="01:49:03.100" style="s2">sort of indexes that says I need to</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.300" end="01:49:04.780" style="s2">solve this problem you can solve it well</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.100" end="01:49:07.510" style="s2">c&#39;mon if they are the sort of birds in</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.780" end="01:49:09.610" style="s2">suits except in a big fight nice and</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.510" end="01:49:11.650" style="s2">then you go to another context and</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.610" end="01:49:14.020" style="s2">because this is in failure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.650" end="01:49:16.090" style="s2">sensitive for the information that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.020" end="01:49:19.270" style="s2">needed then that is introduced because</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.090" end="01:49:21.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve changed context so what you do</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.270" end="01:49:23.380" style="s2">then is you notice the needed</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.280" end="01:49:25.690" style="s2">information and that connection between</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.380" end="01:49:27.820" style="s2">the information be present in the new</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.690" end="01:49:30.730" style="s2">environment and you being sensitized to</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.820" end="01:49:34.150" style="s2">what you need sensitizes you notice it</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.730" end="01:49:39.540" style="s2">and you then assimilate it is wife and</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.150" end="01:49:43.120" style="s2">opportunistic simulation hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.540" end="01:49:46.960" style="s2">noticing the needed information that has</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.120" end="01:49:49.540" style="s2">been produced by a change of context is</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.960" end="01:49:52.239" style="s2">what triggers the spontaneous transfer</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.540" end="01:49:54.370" style="s2">and the restructuring of the inside and</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.239" end="01:49:58.570" style="s2">that is how the restructuring of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.370" end="01:50:00.670" style="s2">problem story to produce inside the idea</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.570" end="01:50:04.330" style="s2">is here is that there is an interaction</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.670" end="01:50:09.070" style="s2">between the prepared mind there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.330" end="01:50:12.190" style="s2">you have to do to the mind and external</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.070" end="01:50:14.949" style="s2">context variation variation in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.190" end="01:50:17.830" style="s2">context is also necessary for incubation</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.949" end="01:50:22.030" style="s2">to be effective you both the prepared</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.830" end="01:50:23.680" style="s2">mind and the contextual variation so the</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.030" end="01:50:26.920" style="s2">idea here is that incubation is a</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.680" end="01:50:29.050" style="s2">relational process it involves a</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.920" end="01:50:31.300" style="s2">relation between things happening in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.050" end="01:50:33.940" style="s2">MA changes occurring in the mind and</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.300" end="01:50:36.900" style="s2">changes occurring in the environment she</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.940" end="01:50:36.900" style="s2">that you want to ask a question</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.450" end="01:50:47.420" style="s2">your location all over the place here so</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.580" end="01:50:47.420" style="s2">we will get there eventually</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.710" end="01:51:06.560" style="s2">so what you&#39;ve got going on here is a</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.070" end="01:51:11.880" style="s2">very complex interactional model of its</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.560" end="01:51:16.250" style="s2">incubation rather than these competing</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.880" end="01:51:21.350" style="s2">internal models so I think they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.250" end="01:51:27.120" style="s2">right to say yes I was just wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.350" end="01:51:30.090" style="s2">you earlier size sac PD but the</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.120" end="01:51:33.840" style="s2">incubation experiment Smith setup they</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.090" end="01:51:35.550" style="s2">are all in work like you to prove it</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.840" end="01:51:41.910" style="s2">there was a scarcity of replicable</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.550" end="01:51:43.230" style="s2">results and so wouldn&#39;t they ever we</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.910" end="01:51:45.600" style="s2">were going to see what what gets</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.230" end="01:51:47.580" style="s2">replicated in here so what what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.600" end="01:51:50.220" style="s2">on with Kieffer their output this what</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.580" end="01:51:52.680" style="s2">you need Haley Haley what I only saying</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.220" end="01:51:54.330" style="s2">is very good because that was the point</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.680" end="01:51:57.360" style="s2">I was going to get to but thank you so</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.330" end="01:51:59.550" style="s2">much right right so what secret is out</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.360" end="01:52:01.470" style="s2">are proposing is the reason why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.550" end="01:52:04.230" style="s2">getting inconsistency in the previous</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.470" end="01:52:06.240" style="s2">research is because the previous</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.230" end="01:52:09.570" style="s2">experimenters were not controlling for</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.240" end="01:52:12.840" style="s2">the environmental there was a missing</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.570" end="01:52:15.640" style="s2">variable context change</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.840" end="01:52:18.480" style="s2">if you put that variable in and then you</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.640" end="01:52:22.020" style="s2">will get reliable results realization</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.480" end="01:52:22.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.599" end="01:52:35.179" style="s2">so they ran a series of experiments to</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.110" end="01:52:37.610" style="s2">demonstrate an incubation was effective</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.179" end="01:52:39.349" style="s2">but only if relevant problem-solving</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.610" end="01:52:44.150" style="s2">information was presented during the</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.349" end="01:52:47.659" style="s2">interval shear time away from the</p>

<p begin="01:52:47.659" end="01:52:51.619" style="s2">a factor there probably is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.030" end="01:52:57.230" style="s2">about the heat dissipation but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.619" end="01:52:59.480" style="s2">not much so the year away if you take</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.230" end="01:53:00.710" style="s2">time away from the problem but you do</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.480" end="01:53:02.659" style="s2">not move into an environment that</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.710" end="01:53:04.579" style="s2">contains the relevant information value</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.659" end="01:53:08.599" style="s2">frequently the problem there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.579" end="01:53:11.060" style="s2">incubation of that but if you did if you</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.599" end="01:53:14.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t take time away and it involves a</p>

<p begin="01:53:14.030" end="01:53:18.860" style="s2">contract has the relevant information</p>

<p begin="01:53:23.659" end="01:53:27.619" style="s2">for you can do this by doing sort of</p>

<p begin="01:53:27.619" end="01:53:32.480" style="s2">they look for evidence of spreading</p>
