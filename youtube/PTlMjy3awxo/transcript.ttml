<p begin="00:00:03.280" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">retina so yeah today in the written our</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.120" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">discussion we&#39;re discussing a video</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.320" end="00:00:17.840" style="s2">where john spoke to unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna have to call him some guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">because i don&#39;t remember his name</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:25.119" style="s2">but uh they were talking about a variety</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:29.119" style="s2">of metaphysical concerns</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.119" end="00:00:29.119" style="s2">around like head</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">as always if anyone else has got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">you go fast</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">his name is matt seagal uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.079" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">veloskin</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">so feel free to come forward with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">whatever i think you should go for first</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">shut up</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:01.120" style="s2">just for the first one to break the ice</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">all right so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">the main takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">i had was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of well i&#39;ve got like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">hodgepodge here it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">i&#39;m realizing it&#39;s a bit disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">um but the main one was</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">the allusion to the whole cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">split</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.759" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">of mind and matter so a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">especially because pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">viveki goes over that in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">made a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">it i remember it making a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">with respect to why we&#39;re in the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t actually want specifics</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.840" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">i i think we should probably make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">project out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">making that clear although it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">after talking to strowin he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">a fair bit himself already</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">yeah anyone got any thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">well i mean that is basically my</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">wheelhouse as far as i can understand it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">um but just based on what my natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">curiosity and interest in the subject is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a fair comment um</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">somebody else said they had one like one</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">line what was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">i have it and i i can&#39;t explain it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">you but i can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">the line the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">reverence to the magnetic pull between</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">emergence and reverence</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">so in the third mine i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">about the third mine with uh greg</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">jordan and john when they had discussed</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">the third mine</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">and um that is kind of where it came to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">one after i listened to that and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">this i got the virtue of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">to the magnetic pull between emergence</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">reverence the pole between emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">reference</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">could you illuminate how that&#39;s a pole</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">a pull um</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">okay so they use they use the infinity</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">sign</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">go ahead i was just going to say it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re using um when you say</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">magnetic pole you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">opposites like north and south right</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">i think what can saying is that that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">emergence and emanation those make</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">sensible</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">opposites but emergence and reverence</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">that seem to be in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">okay so they used uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">in the uh video there was the infinity</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">sign</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">and on one side was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">imminent emanation and the other side</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">was the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">so that when matt talked about it he</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">showed a picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">of the infinity sign and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">two um things and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">that&#39;s where i got the uh magnetic pull</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">from because when i think of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">uh the infinity sign that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">where&#39;s the reverence though the is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">emergence and emanation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">so they talked about virtues and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">was virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">right that&#39;s what i got from the video</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">so yeah okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">i have to be fairly brief today</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">but i think i can throw in on top of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">what uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">lin just uh provided</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">not probably as original as you lynn but</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">just from my notes</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">and this ties back to last week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">generated by veloskin can you guys hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">me okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">so john did one of his things where he</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">kind of logically ties</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">one thing to another to another to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">another and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">comes up with some outcome and my notes</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">that he starts with rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">my recollection is that he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">about the circumscription</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">of rationality and the redefinition of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">in other words may be harkening back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">what you said at the start about</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">cartesianism velocity etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">john in the video described it as</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">rationality is aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">so that kind of almost biological</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">frame that he puts on things and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">kicker he said that must be tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">of the virtue of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">and they started talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">metaphysics of reverence and the only</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">note that i really</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">stood out to me was that it must include</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">the theological</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">which in a sense brings us to where we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">talking about religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">so go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">i have a question for you in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">because what do you mean by theological</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">i mean um it seems to me that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">people have different ideas of what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">subject means and because everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">different ideas when we say when we</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">invoke the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t actually have a common</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">understanding of what is meant and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">that&#39;s actually one of the perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">problems with</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">the retina project is that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">coming at this from different angles so</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">um what do you think of is meant by</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">theology</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">yes that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s do the word thing um</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">uh theological someone&#39;s gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">correct me maybe man well can you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">your etymology but isn&#39;t it theos is god</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">logical is like the study of etc</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">and uh let me run with this for just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">minute vlog um</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">stuart sorry so</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">inherent in the definition of theology</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">me inherent in that is the very fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">that everybody has a kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">take on</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">god and i&#39;m just going to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">god i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">i know that it&#39;s a um</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">both controversial and vexed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">and frankly an exhausted term</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s also intrinsic as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">rightly point out strong</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">to this project so in simple terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">theology means different people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">thinking about god</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">okay um i just want to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">slightly because</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">um i do i&#39;ve also looked up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">etymology of theology and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">actually maybe vlaska told me but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">interesting thing was that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">root of theo is maker</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">theology we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">talking about divinity talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">at least from a historical context when</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">people decided to name god theo they</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">were actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">they were looking for the creative</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">principle of the universe itself it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">very interesting to me because</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">the whole conversation regarding white</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">haters is recapitulation of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">but actually the very notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">creativity is right there in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">the concept of theology i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">personally it&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">you know all of our religious stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">are creation stories that&#39;s because we</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">worshipping</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">creation not just because we have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">idea that there was an origin somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">but because we are we&#39;ve been worshiping</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">the idea of the creative potential</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">because that is how we have identified</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">fertility as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">um well barrenness and and drought and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">uh what have you you know um and so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">and with respect to reverence um</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know i i i get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">that what&#39;s missing here actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">a understanding of what the whole is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">science has given us a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">picture of the particularities but</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">we&#39;re at a total loss when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">the whole um and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t really have an argument for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">at this point but i mean that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">i feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a great um refinement thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">i love it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">what can i say something</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">good because</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">for sure science seems a big part in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">in the verveiki&#39;s world view and uh i</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">probably in the what what no would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">so is there any reverence out of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">worldview though</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">and how could we if the if there&#39;s none</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">how can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">maybe create some or or find</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">or why you know what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of pointing out that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">scientific world view doesn&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">reverence in it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">well no no no i&#39;m not i&#39;m just asking i</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">mean because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">of course they&#39;re all because it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">it goes so deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">but maybe i would say yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">yeah that is sort of lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">reverence to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">i mean on the surface i would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a complicated issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">actually i don&#39;t think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">try and look at it in a simplistic way</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">on the one hand yes i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">science doesn&#39;t have any kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">of meaning there all of these numbers</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">and formulas and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">you know math is described as a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">amount of energy but we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">know what that energy is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">it&#39;s more description of heart behaves</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got that on the one hand but</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">on the other hand you do have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">and they sit there and you do get</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">scientists with a genuine sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">wonder about the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">yeah and that is well i think would work</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">for vacuum i don&#39;t think it goes far</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">enough to be honest but i think what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">viveke would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">arguing in favor of is the idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">kind of scientific wonder about what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">world is like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">being part of a ritual practice in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">religious setting more or less</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">did you say scientific wonder strewn did</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">i hear that correctly</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">uh well what i meant was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">acts like stephen hawking you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">writing books about how you know what</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">what possibly happened before the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">bang it&#39;s all speculative there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">clear answer but he&#39;s but he was you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">know clearly curious about it he had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">sense of wonder about it like it filled</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">it he he kept wanting to grow himself to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">the point where he could actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">uh grapple with these questions and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">think that that&#39;s the that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">emotional kind of complex of of feelings</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">or whatever that vivace is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">to to unearth and bring in to a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">and and maybe that&#39;s the point that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">religions are missing</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">that kind of scientific wonder that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">can bring about and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">compared to the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">well it could depend i mean i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">you could definitely say that of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">fundamentalists</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">could you sort of see fundamentally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.600" style="s2">i guess you could you could see</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">fundamentalism is like a</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">uh yeah sort of it depends i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">maybe not a modernized definition of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">science but certainly an ancient one</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">you know because science well the root</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">of the word science is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">the latin for cientia to see and so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">you know science was an attempt to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">into the world fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">and so but it was understood as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">rational project right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">fundamentalism is all about making</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">trying to make religion like a rational</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">you know logical kind of a system almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">and then adhering to that logical system</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">as if adhering to that logical system is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">what&#39;s going to bring you salvation</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">so you have your you have your doctrines</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">your beliefs your creed or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">then you adhere to it and then you try</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">and behave</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">in accordance to what you hold and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s fundamentalism in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">um so does anybody else have any of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.839" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">okay so i do have a couple of notes</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">myself um</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it will be really</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">discussion topics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">as such but i thought it was very</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">interesting for example that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">it was mentioned that kant favored an</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">imminent teleology in self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">systems um and that this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">view of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">of biological systems is coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">the fall because</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">a non-tediological explanation seems to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">be unsatisfying or a mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">explanation of life is unsatisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">and incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">you may want to slow that one down a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">little bit uh they&#39;re big ideas mr ron</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">referring to can&#39;t okay yeah well i</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">don&#39;t i&#39;m not terribly familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">content uh sorry solid</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">or sold solid uh your microphone</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">is picking up a lot of static there i</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you can do something about</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">uh just perhaps if you&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">mute yourself um so</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">yeah great um yeah well i&#39;m not terribly</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">familiar with kant on this particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">point i&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">familiar with his distinction of not</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">being having knowledge of the thing in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">so i can&#39;t really speak with any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">expertise on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">but viveki did speak about kant and his</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">idea of self-organizing systems um in</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">his written eye lectures at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">um yeah so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">would it help to go over those ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">are you familiar with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">not explicitly i&#39;m a bit more like you i</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">know kant is a beast</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to you can get it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">yeah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">world of [ __ ] unless you&#39;re careful</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">yeah um so i don&#39;t think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">uh productive to go into rabbit down a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">rabbit hole about can&#39;t at this point</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">the the the bottom line is basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">um and with respect to whitehead at</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">or the project that he&#39;s chasing after</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">the problem was with the mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">science of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">enlightenment era right there&#39;s no room</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">for anything acting on purpose so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">everything is inert</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">the idea of teleology is this purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">action the problem is that we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">um the causal loops of of living systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">without some without appealing to some</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">kind of intentionality or teleology</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">the the purely mechanistic description</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">of life fails to actually describe the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">phenomena that we experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">and so therefore it&#39;s a short like um</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">what this is telling us is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">telling us that something about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">mechanistic view of the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">but we aren&#39;t exactly sure what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">that that&#39;s what i take it to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">now we&#39;re like that to rip now right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">written or in sense you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly it it&#39;s trying to come up</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">with okay so um people are in a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">crisis they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">well i would say john disagrees i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">in large part that is because of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">loss of sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">and the fact that we have a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">that does not speak about purposes</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">is part of the reason why people you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">know when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">when they live through that worldview</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">then they start to feel like everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">is purposeless</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">and i think that i think those two</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">things are related because i think if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t see your own purpose in life</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">then you are going to become</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">disconnected and disoriented and be</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">unable to make sense of your own action</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">if you are a thorough going materialist</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">and you believe everything is inert</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s what the worldview says</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">so if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">if you operate according to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">scientific worldview those assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">are in the language that you are using</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">so i mean there&#39;s like it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">surprising that it will bleed through</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">not even necessarily at a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">level but simply at a subconscious level</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">where your</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">where your experiences eventually become</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">filtered through that language</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of this weird thing where</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">obviously a few people know this it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">literally a case of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve set up your methodology in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">to basically push at push the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">then you&#39;ve lived your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">according to that methodology and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve wondered why you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no purpose</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s basically what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">and the the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">um with respect to the cartesian dualism</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">which i</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">they didn&#39;t really touch on too deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">in this video but um</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it it gives everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">uh the grammar itself causes everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">to cut the purpose out of everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got the the the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">materialism and the purpose can only</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">be articulated from a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">standpoint so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe that&#39;s just stating</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">but now it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">the sort of philosophical part of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">we may need to do with retinal which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">like as i&#39;ve noticed oh yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">so i&#39;ve noticed that uh there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">sense we&#39;ve got in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve just noticed a lot of people sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">of are like compulsively objectifying</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s as if they cannot accept their</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">experience just as it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">they get it so it&#39;s like they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">to live in a world where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">just experiencing things they always</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">have to interpret it into something</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s like love is chemicals or some</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">crap um</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">so the sort of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">part of retina may be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">addressing that problem i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">i think that in large part with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">appeal to the participatory kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">supposed to achieve just undermine that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">emphasis on objectivity which i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">you know i mean science</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">is this kind of infecting science at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">moment and in a bad way</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t really know what you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">do about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">yeah i would say and i&#39;m going to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">to excuse myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">after this i&#39;m really sorry but what</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">you&#39;re touching on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">vis-a-vis participatory is correct</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">in in john&#39;s framework because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">going to make a distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:28.840" style="s2">and the actual which</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">may be going to what veloskin said as</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">well about love</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">which is probably incredibly central to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">all of this project</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">if i was to be really honest um</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">if you start making a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">between what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">versus what&#39;s actual and maybe in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">simple term</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">if we said the actual is how descartes</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">boiled it down whereas the real is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">ritner is driving at and maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">like love</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">is real what falls out of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">i guess it comes down to what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">by real there</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">which is a yeah difficult question</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">oh yeah i&#39;m gonna have to get back to my</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">note</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">on that yeah i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">time to justify what i said other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">that he makes clearly and i have not</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">justified it well enough i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">no problem um yeah it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">you need to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">for necessarily but i think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">useful to you to get an</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">you know for you to get an idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">you think is meant by reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">especially if because i mean i think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">thing is that he argues that um</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">that the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">reality has become so synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">actuality so when you think like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">if you accept that premise as a naive</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">western speaker who hasn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">investigated the topic</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s very likely that your idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">reality would then be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">what actuality is right and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">investigate that then you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">have a better idea as to what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">distinctions are and where you feel you</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">particularly want to go because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">you actually just want to follow in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">footsteps in that regard you know who</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">knows</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">yeah absolutely i think it&#39;d be unfair</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">to kind of hit and run</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">on this so let me look it up i&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">you my note on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll oh we&#39;ll have to go i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">but i&#39;ll meet until then</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">don&#39;t worry he&#39;s done important</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">uh i do think</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">go ahead strong oh yeah i was just going</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">to say this this ties into</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">uh what was said in in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">with respect to having to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">reinvent rationality and reality at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">and so yeah i was just going to open the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">door to exploring that topic but i just</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">um could i did you have something else</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">that you wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">yeah before we moved on to the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">potentiality part i thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">uh the talk of uh of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">nietzsche in that regard was was really</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">interesting where he thought there was</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">not a lack of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">too much meaning and no way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">differentiate them</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">and then john brought up the nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">allowing for emptiness or potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">as like a trans trans-perspectival space</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">gives a shared ground in space from</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">which all the perspectives and meanings</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">properly properly evaluated and what i</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">think you said alicia</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">raro argued that actuality and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">potentiality need to be given</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">equal reverence which they&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">not still in the west</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">um and then finally the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">the western notion of god</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">uh like aristotle&#39;s as complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">actuality</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">um which in a sense means it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">static</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">and uh passive uh innocence which i</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">think caused</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">a lot of the problems whereas whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">is pointing to i think a useful shift</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">toward viewing god as part of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">like the argena&#39;s circular</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">or the infinity model sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">well i have a question for you in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">regard because um</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">whenever i hear talk like this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s always something lacking</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">like i&#39;m not hearing the thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">that this to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">the target of reverence and i understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">that there needs to be a recapitulation</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">but i was wondering do you have any kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">of specific direction you&#39;d like to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">that into</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:47.840" style="s2">because well as i say there&#39;s i feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack in general</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">for an object of reverence within uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">theology well i mean evolving god</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">yeah like okay so i mean we&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">of us this idea so god needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">changed you know like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t have the the static</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">intelligibility we have to go for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">dynamic intelligibility et cetera et</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">cetera et cetera it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">okay i accept all of that but what does</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">it actually look like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">of day-to-day practice or you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">what it actually um boils down to in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">terms of the doctrines that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">that we would accept for our</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">institutions and so on and so forth you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">like i just i don&#39;t see those details</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see how one would would get</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">to those details from</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">what has been said so far</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">right well i suppose they would</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">imagine a more organic</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">like reciprocally participatory view of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">but they could still use symbols in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">order to understand it like for</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">uh creativity is the ultimate principle</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">his god which uh he defines as</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">the purpose is to create value in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">world and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">the teleology is toward uh beauty</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">and i suppose that&#39;s like somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">subjective but not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">so you could use some shared symbols for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">that i would think</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">okay yeah that&#39;s actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">other things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:15.840" style="s2">um it likes the fact that i was speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">about the the roots of the word</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.840" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">theo meaning maker it was curious to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">that white had supposedly thought that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">god was a creature it was a creature of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">like how can how can the maker be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">creature of making</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t it seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">circular almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">i didn&#39;t quite figure out how he did</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">seems strange to me but anyway um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not an expert i still need to read</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">more of my head but</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">before the video i was reading a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">he was</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:51.520" style="s2">i think defining like he has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have a dualism in the strict</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.520" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">static sense but he has a kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">that reminds me of your your one and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">zero sort of thing where he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">the objective</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">feelings and content and then the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">subjective feelings and content</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">um the latter being value and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">god is constantly present within the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">actualization</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">of each</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">occurrence as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">constraint on the subjective uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">feeling or the value of every event at</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">all times</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">which can be like apprehended to varying</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">degrees</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">um but as far as like uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">called the creation out of nothing no i</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">don&#39;t think you would</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">describe god as that sort of creator</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">yeah fair enough guys um</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">and and ladies um gonna have to excuse</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">myself i&#39;m gonna give you my best</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">uh effort at actual versus real</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">uh and then go um</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">so i think when john talks about actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">versus real he&#39;s trying to split apart</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">what we find mathematically measurable</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">like galileo and descartes</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">primary substance</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">but when john talks about real</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about the transjective</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">uh in other words um i was just</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">looking at his evolve move play</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">lecture which is really good</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">and when he goes ahead and talks about</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">uh participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about graspability as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">of something that&#39;s real but is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">is it actual not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna in a very ginger kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">way saying that my current take on what</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">he means by real</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">is something which can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">in between subjective and objective as</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">transjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">and it is what he calls a real relation</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">or real relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s some sort of reality formed</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">in the coupling</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">i know that&#39;s not totally satisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s the best i&#39;ve got for now</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">and i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m obliged to have to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">so really good talking to you all i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">see you again soon</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">catch you later bye</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">yeah actually that that&#39;s good bringing</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">in the transjective i think because</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">uh whitehead i think has an analogous</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">concept where he</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">defines the like the presentational</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">immediacy or the objective feeling or</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">objective content</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">um as basically what hume</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">boiled down to when he went for radical</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">empiricism and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">the causal efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">of things was ignored by hume and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">that&#39;s more where value lies but then to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">bind those two together</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">uh can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">what do you mean by causal efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">basically just</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">uh like the chain of of causes in</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">general which</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">hume kind of got rid of with his radical</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">okay which would also imply like be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">condition for any kind of purpose as</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">well i would think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">um but to tie those two together</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">um kind of the subjective and objective</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">worlds to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">um you need some kind of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">reference</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">which in some sense i think could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">argued to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.919" style="s2">related to the imagination but also i</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">think you could tie it to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.919" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">transjective as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s whitehead&#39;s symbolic reference</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">well yeah i don&#39;t know i just uh well i</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">some qualms about how transactivity is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">you being used as the bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">object and subjective but</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">in principle i don&#39;t have i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">well that kind of approaches in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">right ballpark at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">yeah they didn&#39;t go over this so we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">go back to parts of the video</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">if you guys have things i have a few</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">things to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">no well yeah if you&#39;ve got stuff to add</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">by all means but i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">necessarily think that we should just</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">kill this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">right here but yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">also it&#39;s also worth talking about even</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">if it is a bit of a deviation</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">but yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re just reminding me of your uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">the fourth thing that&#39;s not transjective</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">probably don&#39;t need to get into that um</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">well well just what is it very briefly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to remember what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">called it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">oh you mean mine oh yeah so i had the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">projective so it&#39;s the transjected</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">project of the opposite each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">um i was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:23.559" style="s2">uh verveicky i think for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">saying that he thought of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.559" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">metaphysically that intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">is the metaphysical equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">relevance realization which i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">heard</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">i think he said the opposite i think he</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">said that intelligibility is like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">opposite pole of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">well as i heard him say he didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">to invoke a chorus like a correspondent</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">in a correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">theory truth kind of way but and so i</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">took it like it was a more of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">metaphorical correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">but the idea was that insofar as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">the universe itself is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.440" style="s2">have the principle of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">relevance realization is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.440" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">as yeah i don&#39;t know this there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">but that that&#39;s more or less what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">have in common so like relevant</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">i guess is life&#39;s attempted</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">yeah isn&#39;t relevance realization the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:28.240" style="s2">that our sense data is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">made intelligible isn&#39;t intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.240" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">well in part but the point is that from</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">a metaphor like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">what he says in um with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">parmenides and everybody else who</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">followed in his footsteps is that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">um intelligibility was assumed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">ground of existence</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">and so everything the the question then</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">was okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">how how do we go about explaining the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">intelligibility of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">so from a from a philosophical game</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">perspective the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">the game that they were trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">play was to figure out the world by</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">by trying to explain intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">if the world is intelligible and you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">explain why the world is intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">i suppose it stands to reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">could explain a whole lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">world itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">and so the strategy will try to explain</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">the world by explaining its</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">whereas relevance realization fills in</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">that role of being the start</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">incidentally by just</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">stepping back from intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">saying you start an absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">and then you realize relevance and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve created intelligibility and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">you go from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t need to explain why the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">world is intelligible but</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">by why the world is realizable relevance</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">is realizable</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">um i i think vivek would push back on</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">that particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">way of looking at things and i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely because he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">the e rejects what he calls the um the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">romantic and the empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">um opposition so um it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">the world is neither a blank canvas upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">which we paint ourselves and the mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t a blank slate that is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">um you know that is written upon by</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">society whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">after we&#39;re bought um he rejects both of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">those and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about sounds to me a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you mean it this way but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">the way that you described it to me it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">sounded</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">um like the intelligibility isn&#39;t out</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">there in the world the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">is something that you add to the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">and i think the vacuum would push it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">back against that but</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">i mean maybe i have the wrong read i</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">yeah no i was i was saying that like we</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">start like we we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">straight away i i but like</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">um uh no no</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">sure that&#39;s something that we have to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">make sort of i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">that that&#39;s yeah i i would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">you that relevance realization is meant</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">to be the process that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">intelligibility in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">yeah but constrained by reality um</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">of course well yeah that just begs the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">question what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">by reality again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">well yeah okay so if we&#39;re defining</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">reality as</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">this subjective thing constrained by an</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">objective world</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">then i should say relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">is constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">the objective or constrained by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">actual and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">uh and creates reality but</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">um yeah i just misspelled in</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">putting reality though</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">well i i wouldn&#39;t say you misspoke</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">necessarily it&#39;s just that it&#39;s unclear</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">you know like like yeah yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">this is going off topic a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">also you know um the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">conversations that john&#39;s having with um</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">greg enriquez</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">about um you know de-equivocating the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">that&#39;s an ongoing project and i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">know as they do it you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s good for us to try and do the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">you know we&#39;d have subpar outcomes so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">yeah exactly i mean the point that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">being made explicitly a moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">ago was our culture equivocates reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">and actuality</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">and so when i try to say actuality and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">the word reality comes out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s habits that have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">ingrained that yeah we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">address so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">okay yeah fair enough but i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">know it could also be that actually you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">think while reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">and actuality are synonymous you know we</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">should we should allow for that as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">in terms of of making sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">equivocation space goes away</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">yeah sure uh yeah sure does anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">have notes</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">um i had a point oh well</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">this might not be notes but another</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">follow-on on the subject of um</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">what&#39;s like what do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">worship um</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember whose point it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">where you asked</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">how they might fill in the gap</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.599" style="s2">of like great but what does that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">actually look like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.599" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">does anyone remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">the gap of what um</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">i think it was maybe you today or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">was making a point uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">and then strong came in and said that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">does sound good that does sound like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:42.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">um but it raises the question of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">like what what actually is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">that we worship or revere in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">but i can&#39;t remember what the point was</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">being commented on i just remember like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">you know what i&#39;d say next so if no one</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">remembers i can just say</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">but yeah it was the idea of god as</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">along with uh creatures it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">yeah right they agree with is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">it kind of ties to another note i made</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">where they were talking near the end</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">how uh the solution is we</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">need to imagine ourselves as being</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">in the enactment of god or the divine i</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">was participating</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">in it uh because again i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">uh aristotle&#39;s older idea of god is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">totally actualized</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">and passive eventually um led to a loss</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">of purpose once people kind of figured</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">out most of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">apparent laws of nature um like there</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">was not much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">need for god um which i think was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">major component of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">and then how they talked about ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">peoples felt the need to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">rituals on a regular basis or the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">would end so it was participatory</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">in that sense um and then that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">enacting god also reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">alexander bard&#39;s idea of cynthiaism</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">creating god</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">in the digital age and he&#39;s also getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">pretty hardcore in the whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">regional</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">interesting yeah that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">so the point that i was going to make is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">just um</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">in the awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s this discussion of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">and and the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t remember what the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">is but</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">as distinguished from sacredness but</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">sacredness was described as this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">that invokes</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">awe and pushes you to the edges of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">horror</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">to fill the purpose of horror but also</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">protect you from it</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">and he said he he made he claimed this</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:53.079" style="s2">important necessary and of sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">feature of sacredness is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.079" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">inexhaustibility um so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">where you would look for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">a god to revere a god to worship um</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">or something sacred to worship i i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">it would be something</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">well the the claim that was made was</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">inexhaustible i kind of contemplated</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">three things</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">that have always been signifi have</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">over time become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">significant to me because of their</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">inexhaustibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">those three things are um like the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">infinite detail of the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">that we we can function in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">these categories and obstructions but</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">um all of these categories and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">obstructions that we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">you can look at this precise detail</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">that&#39;s always being</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">simulated which just from a like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">software simulation perspective boggles</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">my mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">um the other is just the sheer scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">that you can like look out and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">volume of the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">is huge and the third thing that seems</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">is the combinatoric potential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">emergence um and then those three things</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">kind of multiply together to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">well even more inexhaustible um</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">so but i don&#39;t think that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">exhaustive list of inexhaustible things</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">those are the three that stand out to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">and then these points of dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">and participating in like just imagining</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">participating</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">in the details of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of meditative suchness</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">um participating in the vastness of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">world is a kind of contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">contemplative mourners practice and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">emergence um i don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">would look like but it sounds really</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">so um but i&#39;m only making these</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">connections now</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">in terms of connecting sacredness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">inexhaustibility to something that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">actually participate in</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">so that might be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s really good bringing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:10.160" style="s2">in inexhaustibility that you reminded me</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">of of that term</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">um so i&#39;m guessing you&#39;d say of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">three the infinite detail is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">moreness</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">uh or sorry the infinite details the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:21.200" style="s2">suchness the sheer scale is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">moreness and then the combination</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.200" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">potential for emergence</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">is uh i guess the third factor</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">um as far as is that right</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">yeah i guess sir uh i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">the emergence is almost just pointing</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">out that like if you have suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">mourners at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot going on um</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">yes you could you could even save them</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">as that conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">yeah and then what i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">sorry velocity and i just want to say i</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">think sacredness and the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">uh differentiation was i believe sacred</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">the sacred is like a symbol for</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">sacredness which may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">be idolatrous if i remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">yeah so i would simply say that that uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">this is the sacred is suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:22.200" style="s2">sacredness is moreness</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">yeah because the sacred is a particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.200" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">that&#39;s meant to lead you to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">you know sacred nurse in general</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">you know particular sort of brings it</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">makes you think of suchness</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">yeah yeah the whole like bridging the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">someone said it was like emergence</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">emanation with two</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it emergency is suchness to</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">mourn us and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">emanation is modest to suchness</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.920" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">they were saying that whitehead seemed</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">to be a neoplatonist but not</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">an emanationist similar to aregina</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">that a mixture of the two that john was</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">jonathan pedro</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">extremely i</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">um so what was this about a mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.800" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">the two</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">that whitehead like aerogena had that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">uh infinity symbol like the graph uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">massigal</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">showed up between emanation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">emergence as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">neoplatonism which tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">emanationist if i recall</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">oh yeah and they&#39;re sort of in it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">like one</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">is supreme over the other it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">kind of thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">yeah actually that&#39;s the note i made</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">which was uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">if you take that as</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">if you take that dialogic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">as a the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">and if you think of the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">you know that the universe has coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">out of the sacred as in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">the dialogic relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:36.839" style="s2">suchness and moreness due to like</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">through emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">emanation then</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">you could sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">like the point of life</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">as to basically live the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">this is all maybe nonsense but</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">i&#39;m just gonna throw it in anyway</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">well i think that was maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">historical just</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">like you know um the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.280" style="s2">idea of worshiping the gods was to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">closer to whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.280" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">portfolio the god was in charge of right</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">so you worship the god of fertility so</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">that you can be more fertile um</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">but there was there was this whole um</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">emanation emergence thing and and not</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">being an emanationist</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">um well i don&#39;t know maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">will be a bit too um abstract but</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">the other like like viveki talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">the three orders right the nomological</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">moral and the narrative orders the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">nomological order so far as i understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the laws of the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:51.680" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">like the the the you know like e equals</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">m c squared that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">a law of the world almost you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that the world operates</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">into constant</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">the thing is that if if you reject near</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">neo-platonic</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">emanation right um the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">idea of the nomological order was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">there was this</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">this this uh hierarchy between what was</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">sacred and what was profane</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">and so you have like mata which as segal</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">said um</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">according to platinus whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t strictly speaking doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">exist right</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">um and then the other that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">profane arc and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">on the other end of the hierarchy is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">is the one or the the the contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">the form or i don&#39;t know what you really</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">want to call it but um</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">the whole the whole logical order in</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">terms of the hierarchy is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.800" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">built upon the idea that the emanation</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">is superior to the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">if you if you undermine that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">question is what remains actually of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">nomological order and i was wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">anybody had any thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">because it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">that if if you do that move well then</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">you flatten the entire hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">because you can&#39;t you can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">emanation is to be privileged over</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">emergence anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually stand to reason that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">all of the the potential or</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">or material stuff or the that it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">inferior to what is you know most</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">actualized almost</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">realized almost real</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">so from an emanationist account how</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">you uh account for like picking</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">greg henry case emergence points</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">if you went back to a time period before</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">like bringing organisms with brains for</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">yeah i mean the historical as i</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">understand it the the historical</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">approach was basically finances</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">approaches like okay well the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">the um the emanation is superior to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">emergence the emanation makes the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">emergence possible therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">emanation depends upon the emergence i</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">mean sorry</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:58.559" style="s2">the emergence depends upon the emanation</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">therefore it is superior</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.559" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">so end of story so it&#39;s not that the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">emergence isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">that the emergence is some is in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">way treated as the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">impure or the inferior things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">gotten rid of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">you see yeah so if you if you if you if</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">you if you create the infinity sign</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">between two</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">between both sides well then um you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:21.040" style="s2">the idea is that okay so that</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.040" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">angels and then you&#39;ve got humans then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got animals and then you&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">whatever you you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">at each point there&#39;s this like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">less actual right at least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">um so it would seem that the nomological</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">order is completely undermined by</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">putting in that that infinity between</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">the emergence the emanation i was just</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">wondering if anybody else saw that or if</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a way around it perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m familiar enough with</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">you can still have the i mean the thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">are gina and whitehead are both talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">obviously allows for both um</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">to influence each other in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">top-down and bottom-up way</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">but maybe the question of whether the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">nomological</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">order is or rather the emanation is</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">like morally valued more is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">like a question of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know well i mean that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">the point is that okay so you had this</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">idea of a great chain of being right</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">being according to the description of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">this thing the emanation is superior</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not about whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">subjective or not it&#39;s a point the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.880" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">is that the story</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">if the emanation is superior to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">emergence the story of the chain of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">being makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">if you if you if you undermine the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">that the emanation is superior to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">the entire the entire narrative of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">chain of being becomes nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">and so if in effect if you accept this</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">this um dialogue between the two poles</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">neither side is superior to the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">and this chain of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">articulation becomes nonsense and so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">entire</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">that entire schema that that made sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">in a way that people could interact with</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">it goes away and so then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">what do you replace it with</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure whether it follows that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">having a dialogic interaction implies</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">that one is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">superior to the other in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">like normative sense necessarily does it</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">no i&#39;m saying the opposite i&#39;m saying it</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">that it actually undermines that premise</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">but that premise is necessary to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">the idea of a great chain of being</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">yeah i think what both john and</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">whitehead would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">uh some of the more like static or</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">fundamentalist dogmas</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">failed to account for the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">shifting or like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t dispute that i&#39;m agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">you there but i&#39;m saying it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">problem because now you don&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">make sense of the numerological order</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:58.319" style="s2">anymore so you need a replacement</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see what that replacement is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">at this point</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">i mean like if if you are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to have the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">there are different degrees of realness</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:08.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">so that for example matter is less real</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">than ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">then um you have to have an account of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">the world that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">that has something superior to something</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">else and something that&#39;s inferior</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that then the that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">entire hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">it becomes nonsense and it&#39;s undermined</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">and so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">how do you have an idea of realness if</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">well i mean for one you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">they each have different contexts in</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">which they&#39;re relevant like the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">versus the material</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">rather than like a vacuum hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">like the hylomorphism of aristotle like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">the form plus the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">material actual</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">right but then the point is like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">viveki talks about reality and illusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">in the idea you don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">illusion but if you get rid of illusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">entirely if everything is real</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">right so you got mata and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">form and and they&#39;re both equally real</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">then to to have mata instead of form or</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">to form instead of matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to privilege either point</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">right and so the question of well when</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">are you deceiving yourself</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:27.839" style="s2">or when are you in the realm of illusion</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">if everything&#39;s real like</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.839" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">the the entire grammar of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">world this way stops to make sense it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">falsifies itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">right yeah i would think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">i mean maybe if you bring in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">transjective again it would need to like</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">be a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">relationship between the form and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">matter rather than</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">uh we call it like the confused or</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">thing which is one of the main causes of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">yeah okay so i mean but what would it</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">look like specifically</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:06.960" style="s2">that it would um that it would</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">give a give a sensible replacement that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.960" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">allows people to act in the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">like the normative order</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">i think we might be equivocating the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">nomological in the normative order now</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">that i&#39;m thinking about it actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:28.839" style="s2">um could be seen as the proper</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">the proper fusion of the form and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:33.680" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">such that they like create beauty in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.680" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">way john defines it for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">yeah well i mean i i you can as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">yeah you can appeal to the normative</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">order but it doesn&#39;t really solve the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">issue of the neurological order being</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">being annihilated</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">uh the story of the neurological order</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:57:00.280" style="s2">being annihilated</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">is this in some sense um like</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.280" end="00:57:06.559" style="s2">exemplified by the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">post-structural critique of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.559" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">any attempt to make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">you essentially deconstruct by</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">by saying well look there&#39;s still some</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">illusion here so you</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:28.319" style="s2">structuralists</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">are raising empirical reality to such a</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">uh no it&#39;s a bit of a different issue um</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.760" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about is taking</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">somebody&#39;s standards and showing how</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">satisfy those standards what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">about is a different set of standards</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">that completely render the previous set</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">of standards</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">nonsensical well i never</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.680" style="s2">i never mentioned like holding post</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">structuralists</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">to their own standards i was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">these standards the post-structuralists</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">when the argument that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">about the post-structuralist the hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">empiricism and all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">what they it&#39;s it&#39;s part of their</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">rhetorical strategy</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">they they undermine somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:27.839" style="s2">standpoint by showing how the person</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">fails to actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.839" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">fulfill their own criteria that they set</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s invalid that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">the post structuralist move because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">they always undermine the structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">using the structure&#39;s own claims about</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">yeah right i see</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">if that&#39;s a separate issue could you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">have done that to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">um to the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">emanation argument back in the day as</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">i suppose you could have done it back in</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">the day i don&#39;t know if how many people</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">would have believed it or thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">thought you were even talking sense in</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">the first place but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">yeah i mean you know like if if you want</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">to really look at that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">look at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">the cynics um like diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">and so on and so forth they had pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:31.559" style="s2">similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">way of going about things this is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.559" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">post-structuralist actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">but yesterday you wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">uh yeah unless jarvis had another point</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">feel free to jump in</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:47.839" style="s2">um so it seems like regarding emanation</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">and emergence there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.839" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">four different combinations uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">we could look at it and i i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">critiquing one in particular so</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">first you could have pure emanation only</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">which i don&#39;t think that&#39;s really um</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">one of the options here that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">considering seriously um</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">i&#39;m actually not even sure what</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">theologians would have had that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">uh emanation plus emergence but with a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.720" style="s2">hierarchy of realness where emanation</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">is seen as higher in the chain of being</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.720" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">but emergence is also real</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">uh third would be emanation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">emergence are equally real like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">infinity symbol and uh influence each</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">other equally</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:30.160" style="s2">and then emergence only which i assume</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:32.880" style="s2">is kind of uh hardcore</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.160" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">materialism so i&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">critiquing</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:37.200" style="s2">the the third one where emanation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">emergence are seen as equally</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.200" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">real and valued and are arguing for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">second one where there is both real</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">emanation and real emergence but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">um hierarchy of realness where emanation</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">is higher</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">uh no um to be clear</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:59.040" style="s2">i do not consider myself a realist so um</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t try and have a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.040" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">of realness i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">for me um i don&#39;t know this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">really confused terminology but</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">sorry sorry uh hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">realness is still a kind of an odd</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">concept to me unless you mean like</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">uh the uh amount of detail but go on</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">well i mean historically that was you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:26.799" style="s2">know the the entire christian actual age</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">world view was</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.799" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">was predicated upon this hierarchy you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of hard to miss</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">if you start studying it seriously so um</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">yeah okay so speaking personally i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.359" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">consider myself a realist and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">going to be really really</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">hard to unpack um let&#39;s say that i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:48.720" style="s2">mata is real</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">um but but mind is ideal and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.720" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the arc like the substance form</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">axis is between what is real what is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">ideal</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">um and then of course you&#39;ve also got</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2">what is actual and what is potential and</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">black so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t privilege</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">um what is real over what is ideal what</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">is ideal</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">over what is real they each have their</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">own domains um and so in that sense i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">i completely flatten out the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">the nomological order</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">but yeah as i say from from my</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">perspective i think that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">because i&#39;m i don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:27.599" style="s2">and try and have realness as my norm</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">um so yeah but the issue</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.599" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">like the thing you see the thing is okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">so i i don&#39;t consider myself a realist</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:35.119" style="s2">but i see a lot of people saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.880" style="s2">oh well you know realism realness yada</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.119" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">yada and the question is okay so what</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.880" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">does that actually mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.079" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">because the old formulation made sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">but this new formulation</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">is is challenging the old formulation i</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">can no longer make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">of your claims of realness anymore that</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">that there&#39;s a disconnect</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">and so i would actually say well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">you guys should join my side of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">fence and abandon</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">realism because that&#39;s that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">sensible thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:03:00.559" style="s2">and and i mean fair enough like like i i</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">would say that that whitehead actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.559" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">has a point with regards to the infinity</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">symbol and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">the the the feedback and the um crap i i</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">learned a new</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">word uh inamek um that means</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">uh when two sides are foes with each</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">other but they&#39;re not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">contradictions like life and death</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can&#39;t have death without</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">life you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">life without death they but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">are at each other&#39;s throats um and i</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:29.599" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">well the the the i wouldn&#39;t really use</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.599" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">the hostility um idea i think that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">but i think there&#39;s the there is a there</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">is a similar kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">um one begets the other kind of a thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">going on between emanation and emergence</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">so i actually like that part of of</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">whitehead and and viveki&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">um and and i and i i wanted to encourage</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">it i just think that that has</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:52.640" style="s2">consequences for realism and for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">homological order which</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.640" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">in terms of britain are these</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">consequences need to be considered</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">yeah i agree but would you not say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">emanation could be construed</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">as the idealism half</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">perhaps i i i i need to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">because the question is</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">like okay um</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">well then in terms of actuality and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">potentiality where&#39;s the emergence in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:18.000" style="s2">the emanation is it only something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.000" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">on the on between what is real and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">is ideal or</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:26.799" style="s2">um is there emanation in emergence also</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">in the actuality potentiality arc like</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.799" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">and that that&#39;s actually something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">i haven&#39;t been able to figure out for</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">myself yet</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">so but but but i take your point like</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">like at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">at least with respect to to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">historical thinking there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">strong trend</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">to associate emanation with the general</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">and emergence with the particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:46.480" style="s2">and that would follow you know with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">with the material and formal</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.480" end="01:04:53.039" style="s2">um distinctions like you know between</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">um aristotle&#39;s moderate realism and</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.039" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">and um plato as well full-blown platonic</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">realism</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a bit of an anachronism to call</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">it that but um you know those are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.920" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">distinctions</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:03.520" style="s2">i think that you you&#39;re very much</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">following in the same kind of tradition</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.520" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">validity behind that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:09.920" style="s2">like like i i can feel myself wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">make the same kind of moves</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.920" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">but as i said i&#39;ve just got a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:17.760" style="s2">qualms and i&#39;m trying to still</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:21.839" style="s2">figure it out right so you wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">potential is um if not isomorphic not</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.839" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:29.039" style="s2">mapping to your definition of ideal</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">and actual as no no no no no no no um</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.039" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">yeah i know it&#39;s this is i i</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to actually explicitly for</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">split possibility and potentiality i</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">would say possibility is</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">what is ideal and then potentiality is</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:48.839" style="s2">like it&#39;s different and so um you see</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">this is exactly like</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.839" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">um people want to make the distinction</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">they want to they want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">actuality and potentiality as if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">the whole story like they don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">talk about any like what is real and</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">what is ideal</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">and then the actuality and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">potentiality together is taken</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">as what is real that that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">approach that i see people trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">take out maybe that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">my perception i mean um but we&#39;re yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">so what i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">is to um matter is real</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">mind or space is ideal and then energy</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">is actual and time is potential</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">and so the the possibility as such would</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">be it&#39;s more eternal so like space</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">rather than the potentiality of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">sorry i hope that wasn&#39;t confusing</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">i know you just reminded me of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">four yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">all right let me know velocity and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">this is getting too far off track but i</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">was curious</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">if you mean put possibility is uh would</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">you say that&#39;s like infinite and</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">potentiality is more</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">like getting close to actuality because</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">i kind of see those as a spectrum where</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">um is like in theory possible and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:56.240" style="s2">potential is</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">you&#39;re getting closer to a particular</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.240" end="01:07:02.960" style="s2">line of of a timeline where something is</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">able to be active um yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.960" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">hard for me to fit like</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:12.480" style="s2">yeah i think if i try and respond to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">way you framed your question i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.480" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">misrepresenting my own position um</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">so i yeah i know i know that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">people they they tend to see like</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">um potentiality as a refinement of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:26.880" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">um i&#39;m i&#39;m not trying to think of it in</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.880" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">that way i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">think of it um well possibility is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">it&#39;s static and potentiality is dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">and so the real and ideal are</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.559" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">polar opposites that together make up</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:42.640" style="s2">the act like</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">well i would say the axis of</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.640" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">intelligibility i don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">good word for the dynamic access yet but</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:50.240" style="s2">let&#39;s call it a carpe or perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">relevance um</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.240" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">the other that that bridge is between</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">actuality and potentiality</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">and so you have to understand the four</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">together in order to to actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.520" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">be able to to to figure out my world</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">view basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.039" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know was that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.560" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">yeah so you see it&#39;s like the um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.359" end="01:08:26.880" style="s2">the way that i look at it almost is like</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.359" end="01:08:28.880" style="s2">space is like the false existence a</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.880" end="01:08:31.279" style="s2">matter is a true existence in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">um space is the absence that allows the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:35.359" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:37.040" style="s2">is the possibility for for the for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.359" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">the reality right</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.040" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s only it&#39;s only because of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">the the the the non-existence that space</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">has that the the existence of mata can</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">actually fill that space</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a or</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">they are opposites but in the opposition</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">you can actually make sense of them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:54.239" style="s2">like without the opposition it would all</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.239" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be able to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">and i think that there&#39;s the same kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:08:59.759" style="s2">of a dichotomy going on between energy</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">and time</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">and so there&#39;s the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.120" style="s2">thing that you see now is the actuality</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">the thing that that that you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">actual is the potentiality which which</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">stress</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">stretches across time which isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">inactive in some sense but you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know it&#39;s hard for me to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">find the words here but it did</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:28.799" style="s2">yeah so i mean i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:30.880" style="s2">to make it explicit exactly what the um</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.799" end="01:09:32.159" style="s2">what the idea of potentiality would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.880" end="01:09:34.400" style="s2">as divorced from</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.159" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">anything that is static in in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">sense of possibility of what is ideal</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">because i think i think that way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">talking is actually just that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">effective it allows people to think</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.239" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">to to function better but i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">just a guess on my part</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">so you would say possibility has been</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:50.640" style="s2">static since</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">the beginning of time like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.640" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">eternal set of</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:10:00.320" style="s2">um i would say that&#39;s the right way to</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">look at it i don&#39;t know if it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.320" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">actually that way i think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">um well this actually gets back to one</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:08.960" style="s2">of the um things in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.920" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">one of the notes that i had um uh that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.960" end="01:10:11.400" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s project is extending</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">phenomenal</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.400" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">phenomenology into ontology like um</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.239" end="01:10:22.640" style="s2">the question is how do we as living</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">individuals actually interface with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.640" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">like it&#39;s it isn&#39;t just that this</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">automatically or that it is simple like</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">there are these complex structures that</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.320" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">that we have been built</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">out of that make this that make our</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">way of looking at the world possible and</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">so yeah i i would i wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:47.360" style="s2">say that the same possibilities have</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2">eternally been there</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.360" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">but i do think that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">about the way that we think that that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">compels us to look at it that way and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">if you want to actually engage the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.000" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">in a healthy manner then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">accept that that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">that that that&#39;s just the bias that</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have to live with</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:05.760" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">so yeah i don&#39;t know does it answer your</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.760" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">uh yeah and provides a new point well</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.320" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">yeah sorry to bring in the heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2">stuff um so i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:20.480" style="s2">heidegger was trying to when when</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">um john says that he was trying to put</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.480" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">phenomenology into ontology</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s the same move that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">trying to make here with the trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">push the first person into the third</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.920" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">person so that did i demand that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:34.080" style="s2">any attempt to to account for the third</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">person actually is also an account of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.080" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">the first person account of the third</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m sorry that sounds particular but</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">yeah say that last part again</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:47.520" style="s2">the i think the idea like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">trying to push phenomenology into your</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.520" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">ontology right</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:52.239" style="s2">then you&#39;re trying to account you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">trying to give an account of the third</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.239" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">point of view that is also an account of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.840" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">the first person account</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">of the third person point of view in</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:01.920" style="s2">other words you&#39;re taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:03.840" style="s2">for your own limitations in</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.920" end="01:12:04.960" style="s2">what you look at and that is explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.840" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">part of what you</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.960" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">describe in when you describe what</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.880" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">yeah so i think um yeah i was gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.560" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve got one other note but i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">like it&#39;s actually weird how many things</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">we just</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">covered without me making to bring it up</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:46.000" style="s2">yeah so um</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:46.000" style="s2">i&#39;m all out almost</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:52.560" style="s2">any other</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.040" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">yeah i have a couple minor ones too but</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.560" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">if anyone else has it</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.480" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">um well actually there is one other</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.960" end="01:13:09.440" style="s2">thing um i just noted the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.040" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">failure of a non-creative ontology is</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">for godelian reasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">um i&#39;m kind of speculating because i</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not familiar with what john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:20.159" style="s2">talking about well i mean i&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:21.040" style="s2">with good laws and completeness theorems</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.159" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.040" end="01:13:25.360" style="s2">specifically um familiar with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:26.960" style="s2">historical background of who discovered</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.360" end="01:13:33.600" style="s2">this and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">but what i think is going on there is</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.600" end="01:13:37.440" style="s2">well godel&#39;s in completeness theorems</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:39.280" style="s2">was basically the attempt to unify all</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.440" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">of the mathematical propositions that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.280" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:44.800" style="s2">into a complete system the problem was</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:45.440" style="s2">that every single time to create the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.800" end="01:13:47.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.440" end="01:13:48.719" style="s2">what you ended up with was a statement</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.440" end="01:13:50.960" style="s2">this statement is false</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.719" end="01:13:52.239" style="s2">and that self that self the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.960" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">that self-refuting</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.239" end="01:13:55.120" style="s2">statement was possible within the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">language undermined the validity of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.120" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">entire language</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:05.040" style="s2">so i i guess what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">with with respect to a</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.040" end="01:14:10.159" style="s2">creative ontology is that um</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">it would allow for something to be false</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.159" end="01:14:14.400" style="s2">at one time and not false at another</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">so that this it wouldn&#39;t like you you</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:18.719" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">the changing nature of the system would</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.719" end="01:14:22.080" style="s2">mean that you couldn&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:24.000" style="s2">nail anything down with finality and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.080" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">that there would always be</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.000" end="01:14:31.040" style="s2">um relative islands of of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:31.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">but i wonder like yeah i don&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">kind of gets in</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">into the whole um numerological order</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">thing because</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">it seems to me that what goethe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">conclusion is that you can&#39;t describe</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:46.000" style="s2">truth in terms of falseness and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:47.840" style="s2">can&#39;t describe truthness and</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.000" end="01:14:48.960" style="s2">truth in terms of sorry falseness in</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.840" end="01:14:49.679" style="s2">terms of truth and truth in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.960" end="01:14:53.600" style="s2">falseness</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.679" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">so those two the very attempt to have</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.600" end="01:14:58.800" style="s2">an intelligible world would would force</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">you to to divide the world into</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.800" end="01:15:02.400" style="s2">into a true and a false world like i</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">i think in some sense trying to build</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">your ontology out of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:10.159" style="s2">is precisely what causes creates the</p>

<p begin="01:15:10.159" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">and the the thing that we are confronted</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:14.880" style="s2">with now</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">is that the scientific revolution has</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.880" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">actually undermined the very idea that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">that we could</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:21.040" style="s2">orient ourselves towards intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:24.880" style="s2">and live a</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.040" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">fruitful life</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.880" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">too out there</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.000" end="01:15:37.840" style="s2">maybe clarify that last part because</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:41.600" style="s2">how does science undermine our ability</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.840" end="01:15:41.600" style="s2">to orient towards intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.920" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">well because science is okay at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:49.040" style="s2">in terms of the scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:52.080" style="s2">the scientific revolution that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.040" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">like in large part created by descartes</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.080" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got the the dualism right</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.159" end="01:15:56.880" style="s2">and then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:58.320" style="s2">meaning or purpose and the matter and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.880" end="01:16:00.159" style="s2">the scientific worldview only looks at</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.320" end="01:16:03.520" style="s2">the matter and stuff and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.159" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">um that the point is like you made made</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.520" end="01:16:06.000" style="s2">a similar argument with respect to is an</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:07.600" style="s2">ought</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:09.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to get to an ought from</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.600" end="01:16:11.040" style="s2">an is at least logically</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.280" end="01:16:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this gap and so what science</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.040" end="01:16:14.480" style="s2">tells you is what is but it doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.880" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">anything about what ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.480" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">and the fact that we the fact of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">matter is that if you hold</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">intelligibility as your ought</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">then you are left with this well then</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.800" end="01:16:25.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:26.560" style="s2">all you end up with this is but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.120" end="01:16:27.760" style="s2">no ordinance in there is</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">because every single time you try and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.760" end="01:16:33.679" style="s2">look at the is you find there&#39;s no ought</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">and so um you&#39;re effectively isolated</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.679" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">from your own oughts</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.880" end="01:16:41.199" style="s2">and it is this lack that that science</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:42.719" style="s2">um because everybody says be objective</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.199" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">look at the facts but the facts never</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.719" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">speak about the values</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:47.760" style="s2">and the values have always been left out</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s the it&#39;s the language of values</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.760" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">that we are lacking now</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.080" end="01:16:56.480" style="s2">so i am very interested in formal logic</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.360" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">and i can speak to</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.480" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">girl a little um i think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.000" end="01:17:03.520" style="s2">god&#39;s incompleteness theorem is actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.080" end="01:17:05.679" style="s2">contained within the is</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.520" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">like it&#39;s a failure of the is on its own</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.679" end="01:17:10.239" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:13.440" style="s2">um which is if you set up a</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.239" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">like mechanical well if you set up some</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.440" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">symbolic grammar that describes</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">propositions</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:21.199" style="s2">and that proposition that that grammar</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">is sophisticated enough to describe</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.199" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">arithmetic</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:28.960" style="s2">um then it&#39;s possible to describe</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:30.080" style="s2">unprovable statements which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.960" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re false</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.080" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">it just means that they&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.400" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">it means it&#39;s impossible to reduce your</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:41.120" style="s2">standard of truth</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.000" end="01:17:44.800" style="s2">to a deductive system</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.120" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">um well like</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:49.600" style="s2">so this there&#39;s this chain of problems</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:53.199" style="s2">says the the ought from an is problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">um then there&#39;s the uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.199" end="01:17:56.480" style="s2">then even if you disregard the ord</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.480" end="01:18:01.679" style="s2">um the is from deductive logic problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.840" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">and then even if you disregard that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.679" end="01:18:04.239" style="s2">you stay completely within the deductive</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:06.239" style="s2">realm</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.239" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">then you still have to face godels in</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.239" end="01:18:12.000" style="s2">completeness where</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:15.360" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know how to frame it as a</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.000" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">blah from a blur but essentially</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.360" end="01:18:21.120" style="s2">um you can&#39;t you can&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">an ultimate deductive system and say</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.120" end="01:18:24.640" style="s2">things are deductively true if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.719" end="01:18:27.679" style="s2">provable in this system</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.640" end="01:18:31.520" style="s2">um without like</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.679" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">without coming two statements that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.520" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">uh can neither be there are statements</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.880" end="01:18:40.400" style="s2">that are neither deductively provable</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:42.880" style="s2">or deductively refutable um</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.400" end="01:18:45.199" style="s2">yes which which means there&#39;s a conflict</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">entirely within deductive reasoning</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.199" end="01:18:48.400" style="s2">never mind the fact that there&#39;s a gap</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:50.480" style="s2">from deductive to</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.400" end="01:18:52.000" style="s2">inductive or that there&#39;s a gap from</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.480" end="01:18:55.360" style="s2">inductive to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.000" end="01:18:58.320" style="s2">um normative so</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.360" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know so i find a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:01.199" style="s2">time when people</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:04.239" style="s2">appeal to godel they&#39;re appealing to</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.199" end="01:19:07.520" style="s2">godel as a as a symbol as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.239" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">um which may be partly what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.520" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">here i don&#39;t know if that like</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">technical refinement of what goethe was</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.400" style="s2">actually saying</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">like it might not undermine the symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.400" end="01:19:17.840" style="s2">argument um</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:19.679" style="s2">but i&#39;m interested in whether it</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.840" end="01:19:21.920" style="s2">undermines or</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.679" end="01:19:24.239" style="s2">refines the technical argument you were</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.920" end="01:19:24.239" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">no well i think the thing is that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.320" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">the the point is that the attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:32.640" style="s2">divide the world into a true world in</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:35.120" style="s2">the false world</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.640" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">is what you get when you adhere to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.120" end="01:19:37.440" style="s2">norm of intelligibility and as i was</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:40.640" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.440" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">like well what what um was saying</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.640" end="01:19:43.920" style="s2">is that parmenides and platinus and all</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">of these other people they tried to</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.920" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">build an ontology out of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">so in that sense intelligibility was</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:52.400" style="s2">then in other words they made the is</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">they ought</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.400" end="01:19:54.719" style="s2">like i&#39;m not i&#39;m not saying that they</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">tried to derive it i&#39;m saying they</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.719" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">explicitly said is this our ought</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">yeah interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:04.400" style="s2">like so so you&#39;ve got like the entire</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.760" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">rational</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.400" end="01:20:08.719" style="s2">you know the history of philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">the rationalization of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.719" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">can be seen as trying to make the is our</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:14.320" style="s2">ought and</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.000" end="01:20:15.360" style="s2">then goodl&#39;s incompleteness theorems is</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.320" end="01:20:16.560" style="s2">like finally</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.360" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">the acknowledgement that this is going</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.560" end="01:20:25.360" style="s2">to fail like it&#39;s absurd</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.880" end="01:20:28.000" style="s2">yeah i like that um</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.360" end="01:20:29.679" style="s2">but then you see so this this what well</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.000" end="01:20:32.400" style="s2">from my perspective this has questions</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.679" end="01:20:34.159" style="s2">because then um</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.400" end="01:20:36.400" style="s2">if if holding to the norm of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.159" end="01:20:37.920" style="s2">intelligibility requires you to divide</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.400" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">the world into a true world in the false</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.920" end="01:20:40.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:41.840" style="s2">and if the scientific world view shows</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.000" end="01:20:43.120" style="s2">us that this this division of a true</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">world in a false world is actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.120" end="01:20:45.440" style="s2">unsustainable then where does that leave</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:47.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.440" end="01:20:49.760" style="s2">and leaves us like in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.440" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">[ __ ] [ __ ] creek without a paddle</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.760" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the meaning crisis basically</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.239" end="01:21:09.520" style="s2">um i&#39;m still i still feel like there are</p>

<p begin="01:21:09.520" end="01:21:13.120" style="s2">what goethe&#39;s incompleteness serum talks</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:16.159" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.120" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">like uh being surrounded by academics</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.159" end="01:21:22.239" style="s2">you see a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:25.440" style="s2">have that desire to move</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:26.840" style="s2">in the direction of like deductive</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.440" end="01:21:30.480" style="s2">completeness</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.840" end="01:21:35.440" style="s2">and like it seems like you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.480" end="01:21:37.520" style="s2">uh like godo&#39;s incompleteness serum just</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.440" end="01:21:38.639" style="s2">uses deduction to show you can&#39;t go all</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.520" end="01:21:40.480" style="s2">the way but i</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:42.320" style="s2">i feel like you don&#39;t want to go any of</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.480" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">the way and</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.320" end="01:21:46.800" style="s2">um and i like i don&#39;t think godel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.280" end="01:21:48.000" style="s2">incompleteness serum has stopped</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.800" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">mathematicians from</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.000" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">obsessing over deductive true versus</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:56.080" style="s2">false reality they&#39;ve just accepted that</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.360" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">um that they won&#39;t be able to finish the</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.080" end="01:22:01.120" style="s2">project of true versus false</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:02.560" style="s2">um but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.120" end="01:22:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s still it&#39;s still very</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.560" end="01:22:05.920" style="s2">interesting that like goodwill&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.480" end="01:22:06.800" style="s2">incompleteness theorem is the only</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.920" end="01:22:10.080" style="s2">threat to people</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.800" end="01:22:12.239" style="s2">because they started equivocating</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.080" end="01:22:14.320" style="s2">you know reality with their</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.239" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">intelligibility in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.320" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s very insightful</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:29.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t think john would say that um</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.679" end="01:22:30.639" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lack of of a false world</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.040" end="01:22:34.239" style="s2">in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.639" end="01:22:37.600" style="s2">he sees like self-deception as both</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.239" end="01:22:40.239" style="s2">uh false in terms of the is and</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.600" end="01:22:42.159" style="s2">um negative in terms of an odd like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.239" end="01:22:45.199" style="s2">the lack of a transjective</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.159" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2">uh participatory relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.199" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">so in that sense there&#39;s kind of still a</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.880" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">fusion of</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:54.639" style="s2">of the is in the op whereas if someone</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:54.639" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re trying to bring back but</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:22:59.280" style="s2">where&#39;s john&#39;s false world there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.280" end="01:23:01.120" style="s2">one so where what is the the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.280" end="01:23:01.920" style="s2">the illusion exactly you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.120" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">pin it down</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.920" end="01:23:07.360" style="s2">it becomes unclear i think it would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">more of like a false</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.360" end="01:23:11.040" style="s2">reality in the sense of having a false</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">relationship between the self and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.040" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.120" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">like a mismapping of uh coherence</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.920" end="01:23:30.400" style="s2">right but so then um but okay so</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">so but this is the issue then right</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.400" end="01:23:34.080" style="s2">because if if the scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:35.760" style="s2">is showing us that there&#39;s no inherent</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.080" end="01:23:37.920" style="s2">tediology in things that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.760" end="01:23:39.760" style="s2">purpose that you can&#39;t infer the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.920" end="01:23:42.000" style="s2">then there&#39;s no prospect of a mismatch</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.760" end="01:23:42.560" style="s2">because it is you that is generating</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.000" end="01:23:46.320" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.560" end="01:23:49.120" style="s2">purpose you see and so where could</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.320" end="01:23:49.920" style="s2">what could possibly what what could you</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">hold it against</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.920" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">to show a mismatch</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.360" end="01:23:58.800" style="s2">uh i would think it would need to bring</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.800" end="01:24:02.880" style="s2">like the the phenomenology of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">subject like their own transjective</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.880" end="01:24:07.199" style="s2">apprehension of reality rather than you</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:10.639" style="s2">know treating it as</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.199" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">the objective empiricist fallacy that he</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.639" end="01:24:15.440" style="s2">talks about</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.639" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">right what what are they apprehending at</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.440" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">that point</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.320" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">when they&#39;re in self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.480" end="01:24:25.679" style="s2">no yeah how do you determine the</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.320" end="01:24:26.880" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.679" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">what are they what are they deceiving</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.880" end="01:24:32.480" style="s2">themselves about if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">if if what they you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.480" end="01:24:37.040" style="s2">so like where is the mismatch between</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:37.040" style="s2">what and what</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:44.480" style="s2">i would think between what is</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.159" end="01:24:46.159" style="s2">i think you could bring the relevance</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.480" end="01:24:46.639" style="s2">and relevance realization into this part</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.159" end="01:24:48.320" style="s2">and you could</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.639" end="01:24:49.920" style="s2">argue that relevance could be construed</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.320" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">as as the</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.920" end="01:24:56.000" style="s2">odd part of the equation i think</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:57.520" style="s2">yeah but okay so if it should be</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.000" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">relevant then the idea is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.520" end="01:25:01.600" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">to me right so it&#39;s once again as me</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.600" end="01:25:06.480" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:08.000" style="s2">if i find it relevant so for example</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.480" end="01:25:09.679" style="s2">if i don&#39;t want to live anymore well</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.000" end="01:25:12.800" style="s2">then all of the stuff that could kill me</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.679" end="01:25:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer relevant like am i</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.800" end="01:25:16.719" style="s2">deceiving myself because i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.320" end="01:25:18.639" style="s2">live anymore</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.719" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2">the the idea of talking about this in</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.639" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2">terms of truth and falseness falls away</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.639" end="01:25:25.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s you see i&#39;m saying if you no</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:26.400" style="s2">longer have this division between true</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.760" end="01:25:29.360" style="s2">and false</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.400" end="01:25:30.000" style="s2">falseness then fundamentally realism</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.360" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.000" end="01:25:40.880" style="s2">as a as a cultural cognitive grammar it</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">fails to satisfy</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.880" end="01:25:44.400" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know if i could speak to that</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:48.320" style="s2">example very coherently but</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.400" end="01:25:50.159" style="s2">i guess i mean i&#39;ve heard uh yeah sorry</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.320" end="01:25:52.560" style="s2">paul vander clay make the argument</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.159" end="01:25:55.600" style="s2">against sam harris in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.560" end="01:25:56.000" style="s2">bringing things back to the the reality</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.600" end="01:25:59.120" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.000" end="01:26:00.880" style="s2">of the subject for norms um</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.120" end="01:26:02.800" style="s2">makes it you know purely individualized</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.880" end="01:26:04.639" style="s2">but that still</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.800" end="01:26:05.840" style="s2">feels to take into the into account the</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.639" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.840" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">um given the shared uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:14.639" style="s2">set of human biology and so on and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:16.239" style="s2">way the mind works</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.639" end="01:26:18.639" style="s2">there&#39;s generally going to be a large</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.239" end="01:26:21.360" style="s2">degree of what is relevant that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.639" end="01:26:23.120" style="s2">shared intrinsically um and then the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.360" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.120" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">or the more um</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:31.520" style="s2">i forget if john has returned good</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">relevance really</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">i i don&#39;t dispute the fact that there</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:37.040" style="s2">will be like you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.280" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">a consensus and that there will be</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.040" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">outliers and that people will be able to</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:40.800" style="s2">you know get rid of the outliers because</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.239" end="01:26:42.159" style="s2">well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.800" end="01:26:43.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not lying we don&#39;t want you in</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.159" end="01:26:44.560" style="s2">that kind of thing i don&#39;t dispute it</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.760" end="01:26:46.080" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.560" end="01:26:47.600" style="s2">that you can&#39;t tell their li the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.080" end="01:26:49.120" style="s2">outliers well you&#39;re suffering from</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.600" end="01:26:50.719" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.120" end="01:26:53.360" style="s2">like that that claim just doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.719" end="01:26:53.360" style="s2">sense anymore</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.239" end="01:26:59.360" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m trying to remember how john has</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.480" end="01:27:02.639" style="s2">described like</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.360" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">good relevance realization from poor</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.639" end="01:27:05.679" style="s2">uh which i guess you could say brings</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:07.600" style="s2">back a separate</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.679" end="01:27:09.679" style="s2">kind of value but i think you would</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.600" end="01:27:11.280" style="s2">answer something like that which i would</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.679" end="01:27:16.560" style="s2">agree with</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.280" end="01:27:17.840" style="s2">like yeah i don&#39;t know i i i would say</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.560" end="01:27:19.280" style="s2">yeah i suppose you could you would</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.840" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">probably say something about wisdom but</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.280" end="01:27:21.120" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.840" end="01:27:22.639" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about concrete</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.120" end="01:27:23.440" style="s2">particulates here then i would say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.639" end="01:27:26.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.440" end="01:27:29.120" style="s2">um how does he put it</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.880" end="01:27:30.639" style="s2">making meaning is making meaning makers</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.120" end="01:27:32.719" style="s2">because we are meaning makers</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.639" end="01:27:34.320" style="s2">and so the idea is you see it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.719" end="01:27:35.040" style="s2">tautological that we ought to make</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.320" end="01:27:36.480" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.040" end="01:27:38.719" style="s2">and that we make meaning by making</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.480" end="01:27:40.480" style="s2">meaning makers and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.719" end="01:27:42.400" style="s2">once again that that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.480" end="01:27:44.320" style="s2">kind of the the fertility and the making</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.400" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">kind of idea coming to the fore again as</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.320" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2">far as i see it</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.440" end="01:27:49.920" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t dispute that i think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.000" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">that that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.920" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">it&#39;s you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:55.760" style="s2">deeply accurate about it but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:28:00.159" style="s2">not you don&#39;t articulate that in terms</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.760" end="01:28:01.679" style="s2">of truth and falseness</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.159" end="01:28:03.120" style="s2">well i i think we&#39;ve gone over this</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:03.600" style="s2">slightly before i think you could say</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.120" end="01:28:05.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.600" end="01:28:06.880" style="s2">increasing the amount of meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.199" end="01:28:08.480" style="s2">meaning makers which is the only</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.880" end="01:28:11.840" style="s2">intrinsically relevant</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.480" end="01:28:15.440" style="s2">thing also increases the total</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.840" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">amount of intelligibility being</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.440" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">transjectively</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.960" end="01:28:23.679" style="s2">like not perceived but participated in</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.120" end="01:28:26.320" style="s2">by more individuals</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.679" end="01:28:28.639" style="s2">so in that sense maybe you could make</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.320" end="01:28:30.239" style="s2">the total increase or the total amount</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.639" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">of intelligibility as</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.239" end="01:28:36.560" style="s2">as the norm or the odd and then use that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:38.480" style="s2">definition of agape to to feed it back</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.560" end="01:28:40.400" style="s2">on itself</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.480" end="01:28:42.159" style="s2">yeah but the the problem is that when</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.400" end="01:28:44.080" style="s2">you when you adhere to that norm of</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.159" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">intelligibility in a personal way</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.080" end="01:28:47.520" style="s2">then you get up you hit the the goat</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:47.920" style="s2">all&#39;s in completeness they&#39;re a problem</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.520" end="01:28:49.679" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.920" end="01:28:52.960" style="s2">the whole thing just falls apart because</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.679" end="01:28:57.360" style="s2">the grammar doesn&#39;t make sense anymore</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.960" end="01:29:00.080" style="s2">like that&#39;s my objection</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.360" end="01:29:01.920" style="s2">um it seems like there&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.080" end="01:29:02.719" style="s2">two reasons to disagree with someone</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.920" end="01:29:07.679" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.719" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">um and if the people you&#39;re criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.679" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">equivocate those these two things and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a fair criticism</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:18.639" style="s2">but would you agree that um</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.280" end="01:29:22.960" style="s2">like if if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.639" end="01:29:27.040" style="s2">born with some innate desire</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.960" end="01:29:30.480" style="s2">to uh end their life</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.040" end="01:29:31.280" style="s2">for uh knowing they desire to preserve</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.480" end="01:29:34.560" style="s2">their life</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.280" end="01:29:36.320" style="s2">that um you can&#39;t claim that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.560" end="01:29:38.560" style="s2">deceiving themselves</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.320" end="01:29:41.520" style="s2">when they act in a self-destructive way</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.560" end="01:29:44.639" style="s2">um but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.520" end="01:29:47.440" style="s2">uh like in fact</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.639" end="01:29:48.639" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that they&#39;re simply</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.440" end="01:29:50.880" style="s2">definitively not</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.639" end="01:29:52.639" style="s2">deceiving themselves they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.880" end="01:29:56.000" style="s2">acting rationally</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.639" end="01:29:57.679" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.000" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">at the same time it is possible for</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.679" end="01:30:03.199" style="s2">someone to</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:04.400" style="s2">not be innately self-destructive and</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.199" end="01:30:07.840" style="s2">still [ __ ] themselves</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.400" end="01:30:07.840" style="s2">into self-destruction right</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.880" end="01:30:15.520" style="s2">um yeah i mean i don&#39;t see why that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.760" end="01:30:17.679" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be possible</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.520" end="01:30:18.960" style="s2">i think we just need to break down that</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.679" end="01:30:21.840" style="s2">the concept of the self</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.960" end="01:30:23.440" style="s2">and like for example plato&#39;s monster</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.840" end="01:30:27.199" style="s2">lion and the man</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.440" end="01:30:31.600" style="s2">um to problematize people claiming that</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.199" end="01:30:31.600" style="s2">they know they want to harm themselves</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.320" end="01:30:38.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting um and i guess</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.520" end="01:30:39.920" style="s2">in some sense there&#39;s some part of them</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.080" end="01:30:42.560" style="s2">that does want that outcome</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.920" end="01:30:44.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re just like resolving the</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.560" end="01:30:45.199" style="s2">conflict between internal parts of them</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.560" end="01:30:47.840" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.199" end="01:30:48.639" style="s2">submitting to some self-destructive part</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.840" end="01:30:51.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.639" end="01:30:54.960" style="s2">but i mean that&#39;s kind of beside the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.280" end="01:30:58.639" style="s2">point which is just that um</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.960" end="01:31:01.760" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.639" end="01:31:03.120" style="s2">i i guess i&#39;m trying to refine strengths</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.760" end="01:31:04.960" style="s2">well my understanding of strength</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.120" end="01:31:07.920" style="s2">criticism that</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.960" end="01:31:10.000" style="s2">like it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.920" end="01:31:14.719" style="s2">self-deception doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.000" end="01:31:16.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.719" end="01:31:18.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t summon like you can&#39;t reduce</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.960" end="01:31:20.800" style="s2">all disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.400" end="01:31:23.120" style="s2">to one person is wrong and the other</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.800" end="01:31:26.719" style="s2">person is right</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.120" end="01:31:29.840" style="s2">um and in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.719" end="01:31:33.600" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.840" end="01:31:35.440" style="s2">well yes and um the the the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.600" end="01:31:35.840" style="s2">crisis and the historical development</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.440" end="01:31:37.760" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.840" end="01:31:38.960" style="s2">actually been you can see it in our</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.760" end="01:31:40.639" style="s2">history it&#39;s like people have been</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.960" end="01:31:43.040" style="s2">trying to behave according to that that</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.639" end="01:31:45.440" style="s2">that norm and it&#39;s failed and we are</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.040" end="01:31:47.199" style="s2">here today</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.440" end="01:31:48.560" style="s2">in the rubble of the failure trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.199" end="01:31:53.120" style="s2">like figure out well</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.560" end="01:31:56.480" style="s2">what what&#39;s next if that&#39;s how i see it</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.120" end="01:31:56.480" style="s2">yeah that makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.719" end="01:32:00.080" style="s2">so if someone harmed them if they were</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.800" end="01:32:01.199" style="s2">just under the influence of like a</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.080" end="01:32:04.239" style="s2">shallow module</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.199" end="01:32:06.159" style="s2">harm themselves uh couldn&#39;t you argue</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.239" end="01:32:08.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re decreasing their</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.159" end="01:32:09.280" style="s2">capacity for meaning and intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.400" end="01:32:13.840" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.280" end="01:32:13.840" style="s2">it&#39;s they ought not to</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.000" end="01:32:16.960" style="s2">or if they&#39;re getting um</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.040" end="01:32:25.840" style="s2">well i mean yeah but the i i mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.639" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t really see how that solves the</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.840" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.800" end="01:32:35.600" style="s2">i mean like i i could argue well you</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:38.400" style="s2">ought to worship god so you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.600" end="01:32:38.400" style="s2">jump into the sun</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.520" end="01:32:46.480" style="s2">you know what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.800" end="01:32:49.520" style="s2">because if you&#39;re making is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.480" end="01:32:52.400" style="s2">like taking uh making</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.520" end="01:32:54.080" style="s2">is your ought all the way through like</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.400" end="01:32:57.600" style="s2">in a more comprehensive sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.080" end="01:33:00.719" style="s2">of intelligibility rather than like</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.600" end="01:33:02.000" style="s2">the empiricism or romanticism then</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.719" end="01:33:04.000" style="s2">you could argue that someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.000" end="01:33:04.800" style="s2">harming themselves or others or becoming</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.000" end="01:33:07.280" style="s2">addicted</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.800" end="01:33:08.719" style="s2">is decreasing their capacity for meaning</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.280" end="01:33:09.679" style="s2">and meaning making an intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.719" end="01:33:12.960" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.679" end="01:33:15.840" style="s2">they ought not to but you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.960" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">upping it in the stack at that point</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.840" end="01:33:19.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not resolving anything</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:23.840" style="s2">you&#39;re saying well okay so the sr</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.600" end="01:33:23.840" style="s2">distinction is one level up</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.000" end="01:33:33.440" style="s2">yeah i just i don&#39;t see what that would</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:34.480" style="s2">you can obviously say it but i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.440" end="01:33:35.840" style="s2">what it would accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.480" end="01:33:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna i mean if they disagree</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.840" end="01:33:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a i don&#39;t think that if you say</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.080" end="01:33:41.120" style="s2">to everybody well live according to this</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.520" end="01:33:42.320" style="s2">way of life and if if you see that they</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.120" end="01:33:44.239" style="s2">aren&#39;t they&#39;re decreasing their own</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.320" end="01:33:45.679" style="s2">intelligibility well then they</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.239" end="01:33:49.120" style="s2">they&#39;re harming themselves or whatever i</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.679" end="01:33:50.719" style="s2">mean yeah you you could say that but i</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.120" end="01:33:52.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think ultimately that it works i</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.719" end="01:33:52.800" style="s2">think that ultimately if everybody tries</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.080" end="01:33:54.320" style="s2">to live that way</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.800" end="01:33:55.920" style="s2">they discover things that that</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.320" end="01:34:04.320" style="s2">completely derails their</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.920" end="01:34:07.520" style="s2">their faith in the system as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.320" end="01:34:11.440" style="s2">living according to uh the art of</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.520" end="01:34:11.440" style="s2">increasing meaning</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.679" end="01:34:19.840" style="s2">uh if you&#39;re making the author if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.000" end="01:34:21.040" style="s2">well no that that&#39;s something else isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.840" end="01:34:23.040" style="s2">it that&#39;s not making</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.040" end="01:34:24.800" style="s2">is your ought in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.040" end="01:34:27.520" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.800" end="01:34:28.719" style="s2">increasing the amount of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.520" end="01:34:32.159" style="s2">like increasing right</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.719" end="01:34:34.960" style="s2">so are you are you are you drawing uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.159" end="01:34:36.400" style="s2">um are you saying that that meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.960" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">intelligibility are one and the same</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.400" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.440" end="01:34:44.560" style="s2">well i mean there could be meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.320" end="01:34:45.119" style="s2">is intelligible to others but not you</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.560" end="01:34:47.199" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.119" end="01:34:48.960" style="s2">people can&#39;t really access it without it</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.199" end="01:34:50.880" style="s2">being intelligible to them right so it</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.960" end="01:34:53.040" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t really be relevant</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.880" end="01:34:53.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you need both yeah but hang</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.040" end="01:34:55.600" style="s2">on hang on</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.920" end="01:34:57.199" style="s2">saying that that intelligibility is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.600" end="01:34:58.880" style="s2">necessary part of meaning isn&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.199" end="01:35:01.840" style="s2">thing as saying that intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.880" end="01:35:01.840" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.119" end="01:35:07.840" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t know like i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.480" end="01:35:09.840" style="s2">to make that claim</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.840" end="01:35:11.679" style="s2">personally maybe you do i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.840" end="01:35:12.560" style="s2">some people i think do but i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.679" end="01:35:15.520" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.560" end="01:35:16.960" style="s2">um i wouldn&#39;t well yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.520" end="01:35:18.560" style="s2">that&#39;s my whole discomfort because i</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.960" end="01:35:19.840" style="s2">think the people that do make that move</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.560" end="01:35:22.320" style="s2">then they use</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.840" end="01:35:24.080" style="s2">um intelligibility as an excuse to</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.320" end="01:35:25.360" style="s2">create a hierarchy and then they start</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.080" end="01:35:28.000" style="s2">bashing other people over the head with</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.360" end="01:35:29.520" style="s2">that hierarchy and um</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.000" end="01:35:31.040" style="s2">well ultimately it just doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.520" end="01:35:32.000" style="s2">does it it can&#39;t live up to its own</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.040" end="01:35:33.760" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.000" end="01:35:35.280" style="s2">to to borrow about you know from what</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.760" end="01:35:38.400" style="s2">the what i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.280" end="01:35:39.199" style="s2">from the post-structuralist yes so when</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.400" end="01:35:42.800" style="s2">john talks about</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.199" end="01:35:44.400" style="s2">susan wolf&#39;s idea of the making</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.800" end="01:35:46.320" style="s2">meaning and meaning makers as the only</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.400" end="01:35:49.119" style="s2">thing that&#39;s intrinsically relevant</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.320" end="01:35:50.239" style="s2">you think i think uh he is primarily</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.119" end="01:35:53.600" style="s2">talking about what you&#39;re defining as</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.239" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">meaning or intelligibility there</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.600" end="01:35:57.679" style="s2">with his definition of agape kind of no</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:35:58.159" style="s2">i think that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.679" end="01:35:59.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.159" end="01:36:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s speaking to something that</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.920" end="01:36:04.960" style="s2">is beyond intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.760" end="01:36:07.119" style="s2">and i mean i don&#39;t mean unintelligible i</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.960" end="01:36:10.239" style="s2">just mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.119" end="01:36:12.080" style="s2">um not expressly aimed at</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.239" end="01:36:15.360" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.080" end="01:36:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s meta-intelligible</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.360" end="01:36:19.520" style="s2">yeah i mean i think there&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.040" end="01:36:23.840" style="s2">a gradient between</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.520" end="01:36:26.960" style="s2">just pure intelligibility like as</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.840" end="01:36:27.440" style="s2">somewhat irrelevant fact and then deep</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.960" end="01:36:30.800" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.440" end="01:36:34.239" style="s2">but they&#39;re all necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.800" end="01:36:37.520" style="s2">intelligible in order to be like</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.239" end="01:36:38.159" style="s2">perceived by well i i i could say that</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.520" end="01:36:40.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.159" end="01:36:42.719" style="s2">intelligibility is necessary but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.000" end="01:36:42.719" style="s2">not sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.880" end="01:36:46.320" style="s2">and that that&#39;s yeah i mean not that in</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.639" end="01:36:48.159" style="s2">a deep sense that that gets to what my</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.320" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">grievance with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.159" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">to realism is</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.080" end="01:36:59.040" style="s2">yeah so if you added in meaning or an</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.040" end="01:37:01.920" style="s2">opt</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.040" end="01:37:03.600" style="s2">how do you connect it other than other</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.920" end="01:37:05.520" style="s2">than intelligibility being</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.600" end="01:37:06.719" style="s2">necessary but not sufficient how does</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.520" end="01:37:09.040" style="s2">that resolve the gap</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.719" end="01:37:10.480" style="s2">between the is and the ah even if you do</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.040" end="01:37:12.560" style="s2">bring back well then the</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.480" end="01:37:14.320" style="s2">then the the the is is necessary and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.560" end="01:37:16.400" style="s2">auth is sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.320" end="01:37:18.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s the it is the gap it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.400" end="01:37:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s basically partitioning the two and</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.400" end="01:37:21.040" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.280" end="01:37:22.480" style="s2">you then the question is well what is</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.040" end="01:37:25.119" style="s2">the relationship between necessity and</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.480" end="01:37:25.119" style="s2">sufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.320" end="01:37:29.679" style="s2">and that well i mean that is the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.679" end="01:37:30.880" style="s2">question whereas i&#39;m concerned maybe</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.679" end="01:37:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.880" end="01:37:33.760" style="s2">you know the world is exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.480" end="01:37:36.400" style="s2">relationship between necessity and</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.760" end="01:37:36.400" style="s2">sufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.520" end="01:37:45.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe that&#39;s entirely</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.880" end="01:37:45.360" style="s2">unhelpful</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.440" end="01:37:48.480" style="s2">well it still i guess brings the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.719" end="01:37:49.760" style="s2">question of where you&#39;re getting where</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.480" end="01:37:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the ought from</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.760" end="01:37:56.159" style="s2">aside from like innate biology so</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.800" end="01:38:00.080" style="s2">so well um</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.159" end="01:38:01.440" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m no yeah okay so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.080" end="01:38:01.840" style="s2">looking at the innate biology and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.440" end="01:38:05.280" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.840" end="01:38:05.280" style="s2">there&#39;s an is aha right</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.239" end="01:38:13.119" style="s2">so what i would say in in response is</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.159" end="01:38:14.560" style="s2">um for me that there is is dynamic i</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.119" end="01:38:16.480" style="s2">mean sorry there is a static and that</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.560" end="01:38:17.760" style="s2">does is dynamic and so if i&#39;m getting an</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.480" end="01:38:20.639" style="s2">auto i&#39;m not getting it from the is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.760" end="01:38:20.639" style="s2">getting it from the does</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.560" end="01:38:31.040" style="s2">and so that&#39;s also i mean that&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.000" end="01:38:32.480" style="s2">away from the big bottom</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.040" end="01:38:34.719" style="s2">all right did you say our last part</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.480" end="01:38:34.719" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.119" end="01:38:39.040" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;ve got like like you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.960" end="01:38:43.040" style="s2">being and becoming is and does</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.040" end="01:38:45.760" style="s2">right so the noun and the verb</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.040" end="01:38:46.880" style="s2">so i say the the the norm with respect</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.760" end="01:38:48.320" style="s2">to acting it&#39;s going to come from the</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.880" end="01:38:49.760" style="s2">verb not the noun</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.320" end="01:38:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like i mean that&#39;s to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.760" end="01:38:55.440" style="s2">almost self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.360" end="01:38:57.600" style="s2">like obviously yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.440" end="01:38:59.040" style="s2">because you need the norms make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.600" end="01:39:00.560" style="s2">the verbs not the nouns</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.040" end="01:39:02.000" style="s2">and you see but the attempt was with</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.560" end="01:39:02.880" style="s2">respect to this chain of being in this</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.000" end="01:39:05.840" style="s2">in this um</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.880" end="01:39:07.600" style="s2">and the nomological order and this um</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.840" end="01:39:09.920" style="s2">and the realism the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.600" end="01:39:12.320" style="s2">was to create well truth is the is the</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.920" end="01:39:13.920" style="s2">good and falseness is the bad i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.320" end="01:39:15.440" style="s2">no there is truth in falseness but there</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.920" end="01:39:18.639" style="s2">is also good and bad and these are kind</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.440" end="01:39:18.639" style="s2">of orthogonal to each other</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.119" end="01:39:22.320" style="s2">right yeah i thought it was also</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.960" end="01:39:25.360" style="s2">interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.320" end="01:39:27.119" style="s2">whitehead they were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.360" end="01:39:29.440" style="s2">him thinking one of the most important</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.119" end="01:39:32.000" style="s2">tasks of philosophy in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.440" end="01:39:33.119" style="s2">is to secularize the function of god i</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.000" end="01:39:35.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you guys wanted to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.119" end="01:39:35.679" style="s2">that also</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.000" end="01:39:39.840" style="s2">that seems to me like uh well yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.880" end="01:39:42.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.840" end="01:39:42.960" style="s2">it&#39;s acute terminology but i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.000" end="01:39:46.320" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.960" end="01:39:46.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a contradiction in terms</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.480" end="01:39:51.360" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know i mean what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.880" end="01:39:54.159" style="s2">by secular</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.360" end="01:39:54.560" style="s2">i mean sort of like what both vervice</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.159" end="01:39:56.159" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="01:39:56.159" end="01:40:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not the end point</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.600" end="01:40:02.320" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t imply in and of</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.480" end="01:40:02.880" style="s2">itself the reverence for the sacredness</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.320" end="01:40:06.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.880" end="01:40:08.960" style="s2">necessary for well for even just the</p>

<p begin="01:40:08.960" end="01:40:13.199" style="s2">talking about but it can get people to</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.719" end="01:40:14.480" style="s2">reflect upon why that is necessary in</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.199" end="01:40:17.360" style="s2">the first place and then eventually get</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.480" end="01:40:20.639" style="s2">to the point of worship or reverence</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.360" end="01:40:23.119" style="s2">yeah i understood it as um</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.639" end="01:40:24.960" style="s2">you you&#39;ve got the function of god and</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.119" end="01:40:28.159" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.960" end="01:40:29.920" style="s2">synthesize it with</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.159" end="01:40:32.719" style="s2">well it says secular but you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.920" end="01:40:32.719" style="s2">thinking of like</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.880" end="01:40:38.320" style="s2">maybe the individuality yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.119" end="01:40:40.480" style="s2">scientific world for you basically</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.320" end="01:40:43.199" style="s2">so because because at least at the</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.480" end="01:40:45.440" style="s2">moment it seems to me it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.199" end="01:40:46.639" style="s2">well they&#39;re non-overlapping magisteria</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.440" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.639" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">like don&#39;t even touch</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.239" end="01:40:55.600" style="s2">i i i would say that i like your</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.080" end="01:40:57.679" style="s2">thinking but</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.600" end="01:40:58.960" style="s2">i think at the end of the day based on</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.679" end="01:41:00.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do this sounds to</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.960" end="01:41:02.560" style="s2">me like you&#39;re trying to get the ought</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.080" end="01:41:05.840" style="s2">from the ears again</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.560" end="01:41:07.760" style="s2">i had i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.840" end="01:41:10.400" style="s2">i i don&#39;t have a problem with what</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.760" end="01:41:14.000" style="s2">peterson or viveki are doing obviously</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.400" end="01:41:15.119" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t know just just the the</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.000" end="01:41:16.719" style="s2">way of phrasing in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.119" end="01:41:17.679" style="s2">secularization i think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.719" end="01:41:21.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.679" end="01:41:24.480" style="s2">bull&#39;s errand is the goal</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.360" end="01:41:24.480" style="s2">just compatibility</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.920" end="01:41:31.040" style="s2">well i suppose yeah i mean um</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.199" end="01:41:34.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just a way to make it</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.239" end="01:41:39.360" style="s2">vibrate yeah i really i</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.960" end="01:41:42.320" style="s2">i i i yeah i certainly accept the idea</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.360" end="01:41:44.960" style="s2">of a recapitulation of god</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.320" end="01:41:46.960" style="s2">in in more modern terms or in in terms</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.960" end="01:41:49.280" style="s2">that a modern person could understand it</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.960" end="01:41:50.320" style="s2">and function you know and then like</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.280" end="01:41:53.440" style="s2">enacts</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.320" end="01:41:53.440" style="s2">the functionality of it</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.239" end="01:42:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t yes about i just i probably just</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.040" end="01:42:02.639" style="s2">nitpicking over the phrasing that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.880" end="01:42:04.639" style="s2">i think it&#39;s reasonable to point out the</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.639" end="01:42:07.679" style="s2">phrasing might not be</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.639" end="01:42:08.960" style="s2">optimal but i do feel like that was sort</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.679" end="01:42:12.480" style="s2">of what was meant</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.960" end="01:42:16.480" style="s2">recapitulating yeah i know sure</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.480" end="01:42:16.480" style="s2">um i i don&#39;t dispute that for a second</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.600" end="01:42:25.119" style="s2">there was one other minor point i had</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.600" end="01:42:26.480" style="s2">the last one was just that</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.119" end="01:42:28.480" style="s2">john i hadn&#39;t heard him mention before</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.480" end="01:42:30.880" style="s2">that he wanted to add exactation</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.480" end="01:42:32.320" style="s2">as the fifth e to 4u cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.880" end="01:42:36.159" style="s2">and with the brain circuit</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.320" end="01:42:38.880" style="s2">reuse hypothesis um and how cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.159" end="01:42:43.840" style="s2">like deeply analogous to evolution and</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.880" end="01:42:43.840" style="s2">emerging from it</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.400" end="01:42:50.639" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve talked about any</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.440" end="01:42:50.639" style="s2">of that before but i heard it</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.440" end="01:42:55.360" style="s2">ah he&#39;s mentioned it once or twice</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.520" end="01:42:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a big thing though well it</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.080" end="01:43:01.600" style="s2">depends</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.280" end="01:43:03.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i&#39;m not entirely happy with</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.600" end="01:43:07.679" style="s2">it but you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.600" end="01:43:07.679" style="s2">i feel like it could be useful in</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.320" end="01:43:13.440" style="s2">hashing out more specific things</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.080" end="01:43:15.679" style="s2">because it will because that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.440" end="01:43:19.040" style="s2">thing will sort of help</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.679" end="01:43:21.199" style="s2">maybe with stuff like symbolism</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.040" end="01:43:22.159" style="s2">or something yeah well actually yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.199" end="01:43:23.679" style="s2">i i i</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.159" end="01:43:25.840" style="s2">just wanted to bring that up um it</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.679" end="01:43:28.159" style="s2">actually maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.840" end="01:43:29.679" style="s2">there&#39;s um there&#39;s a lot of potential in</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.159" end="01:43:31.520" style="s2">it because</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.679" end="01:43:34.159" style="s2">well that that exact of tendency would</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.520" end="01:43:38.239" style="s2">really explain why um for example</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.159" end="01:43:40.480" style="s2">um you have 80 agreement that um</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.239" end="01:43:42.000" style="s2">uh what was it again the circle is good</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.480" end="01:43:44.560" style="s2">and square is bad</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.000" end="01:43:44.560" style="s2">or evil</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.199" end="01:43:49.119" style="s2">but you know the exact nature of</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.600" end="01:43:51.280" style="s2">cognition could it could</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.119" end="01:43:52.480" style="s2">precisely be what what the cause of that</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.280" end="01:43:55.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.480" end="01:44:00.159" style="s2">yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.520" end="01:44:03.760" style="s2">it also might be important for</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.159" end="01:44:07.119" style="s2">like uh specifying</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.760" end="01:44:09.600" style="s2">different religious traditions</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.119" end="01:44:10.960" style="s2">for what is viable for different people</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.600" end="01:44:14.239" style="s2">depending on</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.960" end="01:44:15.199" style="s2">um what like frameworks they&#39;ve grown up</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.239" end="01:44:16.800" style="s2">with especially</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.199" end="01:44:17.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i haven&#39;t looked into it</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.800" end="01:44:19.360" style="s2">but if the brain circuit reuse</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.920" end="01:44:22.080" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.360" end="01:44:22.560" style="s2">is somewhat dependent on age like if</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.080" end="01:44:25.520" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.560" end="01:44:26.159" style="s2">much more synaptic pruning um during</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.520" end="01:44:27.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.159" end="01:44:29.440" style="s2">adolescence or something and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.679" end="01:44:32.639" style="s2">certain symbols</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.440" end="01:44:34.719" style="s2">and frameworks for sacredness are going</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.639" end="01:44:36.880" style="s2">to be more or less viable for people</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.719" end="01:44:49.840" style="s2">which i think it&#39;s kind of an argument</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.880" end="01:44:49.840" style="s2">for pluralism to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.239" end="01:44:53.520" style="s2">do do we have a confirmation on whether</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.119" end="01:44:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.520" end="01:44:59.760" style="s2">true or that&#39;s just manifest</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.280" end="01:45:01.119" style="s2">what&#39;s crosstalk well the adaptability</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.760" end="01:45:04.480" style="s2">of the brain is there</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.119" end="01:45:07.760" style="s2">has it been a physical</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.480" end="01:45:10.320" style="s2">um yes it has at least if you can</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.760" end="01:45:12.800" style="s2">well you can for example um people with</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.320" end="01:45:15.600" style="s2">bad absolute epilepsy like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.800" end="01:45:16.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s before the age of seven um</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.600" end="01:45:18.159" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.400" end="01:45:20.080" style="s2">well there&#39;s two age gaps i remember</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.159" end="01:45:21.600" style="s2">really quick like there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.080" end="01:45:23.199" style="s2">gap between zero and two years and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.600" end="01:45:26.560" style="s2">two years and seven years</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.199" end="01:45:27.920" style="s2">um and there&#39;s this ah crap i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.560" end="01:45:29.119" style="s2">remember exactly specifics but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.920" end="01:45:32.239" style="s2">like a difference between</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.119" end="01:45:34.719" style="s2">exactly how severe the operation can be</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.239" end="01:45:36.239" style="s2">and still have a person recover from it</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.719" end="01:45:37.760" style="s2">after seven years of age it starts</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.239" end="01:45:39.520" style="s2">getting very very dicey and the point is</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.760" end="01:45:40.880" style="s2">that at that very young age the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.520" end="01:45:42.159" style="s2">so plastic</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.880" end="01:45:44.000" style="s2">that if you lose one hemisphere the</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.159" end="01:45:45.679" style="s2">other hemisphere can actually grow</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.000" end="01:45:47.119" style="s2">so that it takes over those operations</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.679" end="01:45:48.639" style="s2">it&#39;s still young enough but if it</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.119" end="01:45:50.639" style="s2">happens in your older age well</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.639" end="01:45:53.440" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna suffer seriously if you if</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.639" end="01:45:56.840" style="s2">you lose hemosphere</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.440" end="01:45:59.600" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not an argument</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.840" end="01:45:59.600" style="s2">against f4</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.000" end="01:46:03.280" style="s2">well it&#39;s proof that it happens right</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.560" end="01:46:05.199" style="s2">sure but</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.280" end="01:46:06.320" style="s2">exactly i already conceded that it</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.199" end="01:46:09.360" style="s2">happens right like</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.320" end="01:46:11.119" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to figure out the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.360" end="01:46:12.480" style="s2">it happens</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.119" end="01:46:14.080" style="s2">right like could you because you could</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.480" end="01:46:14.960" style="s2">just say right like when you have more</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.080" end="01:46:17.679" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.960" end="01:46:18.880" style="s2">changing structure is more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.679" end="01:46:20.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.880" end="01:46:22.480" style="s2">and especially if you have like</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.560" end="01:46:23.840" style="s2">dependencies upon dependencies upon</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.480" end="01:46:25.920" style="s2">dependencies if you take</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.840" end="01:46:28.000" style="s2">away fundamental dependencies you might</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.920" end="01:46:29.920" style="s2">like collapse the whole system right so</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.000" end="01:46:32.800" style="s2">that would be an argument</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.920" end="01:46:35.520" style="s2">for reduction in adaptability but that</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.800" end="01:46:39.119" style="s2">also it might be an argument for</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.520" end="01:46:41.840" style="s2">not having certain dependencies right</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.119" end="01:46:41.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.440" end="01:46:46.560" style="s2">black watch for example</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.480" end="01:46:56.639" style="s2">well you have developmental stages</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.920" end="01:47:01.600" style="s2">right so the developmental stages are</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.639" end="01:47:01.600" style="s2">in my opinion the</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.000" end="01:47:09.280" style="s2">having a sufficient way of relating</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.119" end="01:47:12.719" style="s2">on one level so that you can build a</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.280" end="01:47:12.719" style="s2">meta level on top of it</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.040" end="01:47:18.000" style="s2">right so but by that using that metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.719" end="01:47:20.080" style="s2">if you&#39;re getting rid of dependencies</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.000" end="01:47:21.040" style="s2">you&#39;re effectively keeping people in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.080" end="01:47:25.119" style="s2">childlike state</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.040" end="01:47:28.880" style="s2">because you you&#39;re denying development</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.119" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">not necessarily but</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.880" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">like that is a different discussion</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.719" end="01:47:39.280" style="s2">well then yeah i don&#39;t know i i guess</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.040" end="01:47:41.360" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.280" end="01:47:42.800" style="s2">maybe talking about the things then well</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.360" end="01:47:44.719" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m first talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.800" end="01:47:48.639" style="s2">principle and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.719" end="01:47:51.119" style="s2">we can discuss the validity of</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.639" end="01:47:51.840" style="s2">of having alternatives later like i</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.119" end="01:47:53.040" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.840" end="01:47:55.520" style="s2">think they need to be in the same</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.040" end="01:47:55.520" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.000" end="01:47:59.840" style="s2">i mean i think you&#39;re saying that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.159" end="01:48:02.840" style="s2">want to have enough resiliency</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.840" end="01:48:05.840" style="s2">by not having too many like excess</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.840" end="01:48:05.840" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.679" end="01:48:12.080" style="s2">well the i would i mean in this context</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.239" end="01:48:13.840" style="s2">i think the resiliency is the existence</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.080" end="01:48:15.840" style="s2">of the excess connections</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.840" end="01:48:17.280" style="s2">precisely but why after the pruning you</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.840" end="01:48:20.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have the resiliency anymore</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.280" end="01:48:20.400" style="s2">because you&#39;ve lost the excess</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.080" end="01:48:24.560" style="s2">actually yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.159" end="01:48:30.239" style="s2">so there would be a decrease in</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.040" end="01:48:33.600" style="s2">adaptability</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.239" end="01:48:36.000" style="s2">after adolescence right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.600" end="01:48:37.119" style="s2">like from from my mind it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.000" end="01:48:40.080" style="s2">trade-off it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.119" end="01:48:42.400" style="s2">yes you lose the the malleability but in</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.080" end="01:48:46.000" style="s2">in exchange you gain the the the</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.400" end="01:48:48.719" style="s2">the proficiency like you know expect</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.000" end="01:48:50.320" style="s2">expertise has to you have to solidify</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.719" end="01:48:53.119" style="s2">expertise at some point in order for it</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.320" end="01:48:56.239" style="s2">to become expertise</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.119" end="01:48:58.880" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;d be an increase in</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.239" end="01:48:58.880" style="s2">efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.920" end="01:49:04.639" style="s2">perhaps yeah i don&#39;t yeah i suppose i i</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.119" end="01:49:06.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i need to think like every</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.639" end="01:49:07.440" style="s2">single time john uses those terms i</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.159" end="01:49:08.000" style="s2">think he&#39;s using it the wrong way around</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.440" end="01:49:11.440" style="s2">and like</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.000" end="01:49:15.840" style="s2">my brain just flips around</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.440" end="01:49:15.840" style="s2">look at that really carefully</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.159" end="01:49:32.880" style="s2">just one quick um so do we have any more</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.719" end="01:49:35.040" style="s2">notes on the video because we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.880" end="01:49:38.719" style="s2">at two hours and it seems like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.040" end="01:49:41.199" style="s2">fair time to finish the recording</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.719" end="01:49:42.400" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m tired of discussing the video</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.199" end="01:49:44.239" style="s2">at this point i don&#39;t know if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.400" end="01:49:47.040" style="s2">else has anything to add but</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.239" end="01:49:47.040" style="s2">i think we can call it</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.239" end="01:49:51.280" style="s2">i mean it wasn&#39;t from the video directly</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.239" end="01:49:54.840" style="s2">but it was about</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.280" end="01:49:56.400" style="s2">that last point we were making the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.840" end="01:49:57.920" style="s2">exhaustion</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.400" end="01:49:59.840" style="s2">yeah well i&#39;m happy to continue the</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.920" end="01:50:01.360" style="s2">conversation i just i&#39;m i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.840" end="01:50:02.080" style="s2">about whatever we&#39;re talking about now</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.360" end="01:50:04.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.080" end="01:50:07.040" style="s2">um i&#39;ve i&#39;ve mined whatever it is out of</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.320" end="01:50:10.000" style="s2">the video and i&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.040" end="01:50:10.800" style="s2">okay well then we&#39;ll just put an end to</p>
