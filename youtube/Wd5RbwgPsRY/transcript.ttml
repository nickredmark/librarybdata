<p begin="00:00:14.280" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">eggie I&#39;m always pleased to be here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:22.470" style="s2">to answer questions we will take</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">questions first from the patrons and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.470" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">then we will take questions that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">been tweeted and then we will take</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">questions from the online chat so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">get right to it please so the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:38.790" style="s2">question is from the patron Quran it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s pronounced apparently in</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.790" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">Danish and the question is where does</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">our human animal instincts fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:46.890" style="s2">four kinds of knowing and how does</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:50.840" style="s2">knowledge of the four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.890" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">help us transform and transcend so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.840" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">human instinct the notion of instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">actually a very difficult notion to pin</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:04.229" style="s2">down because it&#39;s it&#39;s it generally has</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">referred to sort of completely innate</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.229" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">abilities not and that&#39;s very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">for organisms that don&#39;t do any learning</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">projects fighters it&#39;s unclear if it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">applies to mammals although there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:21.720" style="s2">probably some instinct or reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">behavior so I&#39;ll take it to mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">something that&#39;s innate and largely</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">reflexive and that is not altered</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">significantly in learning so I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.729" style="s2">expected behavior along that line I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">a looming reflex so if things suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.729" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">change the ratio in my visual field my</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">head will move I don&#39;t have to initiate</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">that I don&#39;t learn that it&#39;s unlearned</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">behavior it&#39;s sort of wired in by</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">evolution to be adaptive so I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s what we mean by instinct the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:58.020" style="s2">term is used very vaguely and sloppily</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">in general and many things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.020" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">called instinctive behavior really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">not quite clear that it should be called</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">that anyway so I won&#39;t get into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">academic cul-de-sac let&#39;s just take it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">that that&#39;s what it&#39;s meant by the term</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:15.950" style="s2">instinct so they are by</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:19.660" style="s2">that has been rendered largely innate</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.950" end="00:02:21.590" style="s2">due to our evolutionary history so</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.660" end="00:02:23.210" style="s2">notice that that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.590" end="00:02:24.920" style="s2">have to practice it either you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.210" end="00:02:26.960" style="s2">make a very good argument that walking</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:28.670" style="s2">is instinctive for us but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.960" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">mean that kids don&#39;t have to spend quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.670" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">a bit of time for the practicing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:35.930" style="s2">that innate ability to come online so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:40.430" style="s2">have to be very careful all of that said</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.930" end="00:02:41.990" style="s2">here&#39;s what I think I want to here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.430" end="00:02:48.410" style="s2">I think I would want to respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.990" end="00:02:51.980" style="s2">question in so far as evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.410" end="00:02:53.810" style="s2">shaped us in certain ways for perennial</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.980" end="00:02:54.950" style="s2">patterns across many different</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.810" end="00:02:57.830" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.950" end="00:03:00.350" style="s2">I think this would fit clearly into what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.830" end="00:03:03.080" style="s2">I call participatory node let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.350" end="00:03:05.020" style="s2">again about what participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.080" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2">is remember the four kinds are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.020" end="00:03:09.830" style="s2">propositional procedural perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.100" end="00:03:13.130" style="s2">and participatory participatory is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.830" end="00:03:15.290" style="s2">deepest and it&#39;s the way you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.130" end="00:03:15.830" style="s2">analyze it that sort of three-ton time</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.290" end="00:03:19.130" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:21.500" style="s2">there&#39;s the evolutionary scale in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.130" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.500" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">evolutionary processes have Co shaped</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:27.620" style="s2">the environment and the organism to fit</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">together this is called niche</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:31.850" style="s2">construction so what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:33.860" style="s2">because here&#39;s the environment here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.850" end="00:03:35.690" style="s2">the organism the environment could</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.860" end="00:03:38.090" style="s2">select the pressure on organisms but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.690" end="00:03:39.080" style="s2">organisms also interact in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.090" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">environment to change the environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.080" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">and you get a mutual reciprocal shaping</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:47.930" style="s2">and then for us at a higher level we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">also fortunate creatures of history</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:53.510" style="s2">because we exist culturally and culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">also is something that through the use</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.510" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">of tools and technology and simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:03:59.600" style="s2">systems culture is something that shapes</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:01.880" style="s2">the environment to me and me to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.600" end="00:04:03.350" style="s2">environment so this room around me this</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.880" end="00:04:06.410" style="s2">is all a tool and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.350" end="00:04:09.170" style="s2">unshaped see the tools on me to that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.410" end="00:04:11.500" style="s2">then it also practices there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.170" end="00:04:15.620" style="s2">ways I chose to talk and express myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.500" end="00:04:18.530" style="s2">etc and then on top of it so on top of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.620" end="00:04:19.850" style="s2">that so there&#39;s the biological shaping</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.530" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">at the evolutionary timescale the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.850" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">cultural post shaping of the historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:26.630" style="s2">scale and then at the cognitive scale</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:28.640" style="s2">there&#39;s the ongoing Co shaping of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.630" end="00:04:30.410" style="s2">in terms of the sensorimotor alert I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.640" end="00:04:32.090" style="s2">sensing that&#39;s the environment impacting</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.410" end="00:04:34.130" style="s2">on me but I&#39;m also moving and adjusting</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">that&#39;s me changing the environment this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.130" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">sensorimotor loop</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">so participatory learning is these three</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:42.890" style="s2">layers in which the organism and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">environment at a biological cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.890" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">cognitive level are mutually shaping</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:50.330" style="s2">each other that being said I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:53.390" style="s2">instinctive knowledge that you asked me</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.330" end="00:04:55.220" style="s2">about and the way I try to rein it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.390" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">and specify that it met it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.220" end="00:04:59.630" style="s2">would belong to the biological</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:01.700" style="s2">evolutionary biological level the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.630" end="00:05:03.860" style="s2">evolutionary timescale in which the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.700" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">organism and the environment have Co</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.860" end="00:05:09.110" style="s2">shaped each other so for example the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:12.170" style="s2">I gave walking is instinctive to human</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.110" end="00:05:14.750" style="s2">beings bipedal ISM predates our species</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.170" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">by several species and it&#39;s an innate</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.750" end="00:05:20.500" style="s2">characteristic and what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:23.330" style="s2">because we&#39;re bipedal we have also</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.500" end="00:05:25.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the way the environment selected</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.330" end="00:05:27.530" style="s2">but selective pressure on us but our</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.250" end="00:05:29.030" style="s2">bipedalism also enables us to do all</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.530" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">kinds of things that shape the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.030" end="00:05:33.290" style="s2">environment so that we make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">environment more walkable to us and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.290" end="00:05:37.850" style="s2">that brings something out what is all</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:39.140" style="s2">this participatory knowing generated</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.850" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t generate theories like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.140" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">propositional knowledge it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:43.310" style="s2">generate skills like procedural</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:45.140" style="s2">knowledge it does it generate</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">perspectives like respect eyeball</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">generates affordances it generates that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">most of what&#39;s around me is walkable</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:58.640" style="s2">being walkable right is not a property</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:06:02.180" style="s2">of the thing or me it&#39;s a real relation</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.640" end="00:06:04.430" style="s2">between us so disparate already knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.180" end="00:06:07.550" style="s2">that those three interim penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.430" end="00:06:09.770" style="s2">levels of the mutual shaping that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.550" end="00:06:13.760" style="s2">shaping creates affordances between the</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:24.680" style="s2">then that gives me my situational</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">awareness and then that allows me to</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.170" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">procedural knowing allows me to know how</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.610" end="00:06:44.330" style="s2">generates my proposition on the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:49.550" style="s2">how it how does that all relate to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.330" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">transformation and transcendence I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.550" end="00:06:57.380" style="s2">we should understand transcendence in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:07:01.350" style="s2">terms of a deep transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.380" end="00:07:04.289" style="s2">dynamic coupling between an organism and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.350" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">its environment and the deepest kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.289" end="00:07:10.229" style="s2">transformations are ones that and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:13.650" style="s2">is this is ultimately a platonic notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.229" end="00:07:15.300" style="s2">right that in a line stack those four</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.650" end="00:07:16.949" style="s2">kinds of knowing so they are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.300" end="00:07:22.620" style="s2">afforded in each of the constraining in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.949" end="00:07:25.889" style="s2">such a way that I am participating in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.620" end="00:07:29.099" style="s2">the generation of affordances and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.889" end="00:07:31.410" style="s2">am selecting the best optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.099" end="00:07:35.550" style="s2">within my perspective I will knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.410" end="00:07:38.190" style="s2">that I get the best set of skills best</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.550" end="00:07:44.120" style="s2">theories and what this affords is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:48.780" style="s2">ultimately hopefully a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.120" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">developmentally reliable in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.780" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">progression towards the overcoming of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:55.979" style="s2">self-deception systematically through</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:07:57.960" style="s2">all the kinds of knowing and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.979" end="00:08:05.610" style="s2">affordance of an enhanced coupling to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.960" end="00:08:09.560" style="s2">the world which would be an enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.610" end="00:08:12.210" style="s2">in both a sense of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.560" end="00:08:14.190" style="s2">interconnectedness our optimal inner</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.210" end="00:08:17.909" style="s2">alignment and our outer connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.190" end="00:08:20.880" style="s2">that to me would be the experience that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.909" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">would be properly called a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:25.349" style="s2">transcendence when we are going through</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:28.470" style="s2">that systematic and comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.349" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">developmental change so as the child is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.470" end="00:08:32.490" style="s2">to the adult the adult is of this age</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:35.240" style="s2">its development transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.490" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">ultimately if it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">transcendence in the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:41.370" style="s2">wisdom it&#39;s going to be that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:45.450" style="s2">overall comprehensive developmental</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.370" end="00:08:48.029" style="s2">shift and so the animal instincts have</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.450" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">to be included in that I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.029" end="00:08:53.940" style="s2">one of my favorite quotes from Ichi you</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:57.180" style="s2">know that the order can be flipped</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.940" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">it&#39;s German I wish Johanna says here the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.180" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">he knows German much better than I do if</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">the quote is basically along the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:05.340" style="s2">that the heights of my spirituality we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">reach into the depths of my sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.340" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">again with the sexuality is referring to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:12.060" style="s2">for my whole biological to Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:14.520" style="s2">heritage the spirituality is all those</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.060" end="00:09:18.960" style="s2">ways in which I can transform and engage</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.520" end="00:09:24.360" style="s2">in self transcendence so I can properly</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.960" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">situated within the stack of the four</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.360" end="00:09:30.600" style="s2">kinds of knowing and in a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:33.150" style="s2">trajectory in the dynamic couple into</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.600" end="00:09:36.780" style="s2">the world the animal instincts would</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.150" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">play an important role the my concern in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.780" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">answering this question has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:44.850" style="s2">throughout their hit there&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:48.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a version I always think of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.850" end="00:09:53.030" style="s2">decadent version of Romanticism that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.380" end="00:09:57.240" style="s2">tries to locate sort of authenticity or</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.030" end="00:09:58.770" style="s2">genuineness or an infallible way of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.240" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">infallible source of guidance for how we</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.770" end="00:10:03.570" style="s2">act in terms of our instinctive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:05.550" style="s2">and I think our instincts are just as</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.570" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">liable to drive us into self-destruction</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.550" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">and self-destructive behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">anything else but they should not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:16.830" style="s2">demon arts they are not the Beast Within</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.470" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">they are adaptive they are needed and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.830" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">they have to be properly situated within</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">an overall just culture of our psyche so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:31.410" style="s2">the next question is from the patron</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">Tostitos which I just got to meet and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.410" end="00:10:35.190" style="s2">then one-on-one conversation recently</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:38.540" style="s2">which I really enjoyed so I thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.190" end="00:10:41.010" style="s2">for that so this is really good question</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.540" end="00:10:43.589" style="s2">do all cognitive biases stem from an</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.010" end="00:10:45.450" style="s2">adaptive essence then its are they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.589" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">particularly modes of our otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.450" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">adaptive heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">well you some biases are sometimes just</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.400" style="s2">an artifact of how our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:55.589" style="s2">machinery slapped together by evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.400" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">such a difference exists would have also</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.589" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">influenced their impact on</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.790" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">self-deception this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">insightful question and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:09.689" style="s2">so it&#39;s what I need to give more thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.259" end="00:11:12.899" style="s2">to but I don&#39;t want to just pop out here</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.689" end="00:11:15.209" style="s2">so I want it I wanted under said that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.899" end="00:11:17.819" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna always try my best</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.209" end="00:11:23.399" style="s2">but this is really much just you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.819" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">our on the fly I think it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.399" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">case so I am convinced of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">the brain is a kludge this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:33.899" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s a bunch of machines</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.899" style="s2">that have been sort of slapped together</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.899" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">by evolution as Tostitos says but I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.899" end="00:11:42.420" style="s2">but i also counterbalance that with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:44.189" style="s2">lot of the more recent work by Michael</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.420" end="00:11:46.889" style="s2">Anderson and the circuitry used an</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.189" end="00:11:48.810" style="s2">exaptation hypothesis which is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.889" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like the brain as edgy as</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.810" end="00:11:53.730" style="s2">we thought because a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:56.459" style="s2">originally evolved for doing one</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.730" end="00:11:59.819" style="s2">particular job has been exacted to doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.459" end="00:12:02.310" style="s2">other other things so you know like my</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.819" end="00:12:04.759" style="s2">standard ones my tongue has been exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.310" end="00:12:07.019" style="s2">for speech the Broca&#39;s area for</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.759" end="00:12:08.939" style="s2">sophisticated control of their my right</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.019" end="00:12:10.949" style="s2">hand has been exacted for managing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.939" end="00:12:15.809" style="s2">syntax of my language and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.949" end="00:12:17.579" style="s2">whole host of these and so because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.809" end="00:12:19.319" style="s2">the increasing evidence for excitation</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.579" end="00:12:23.970" style="s2">the brain isn&#39;t quite as crutchy</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.319" end="00:12:26.670" style="s2">as it as we sort of thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.970" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">however I think it&#39;s also the case that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.670" end="00:12:33.439" style="s2">we fall prey to forms of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:35.699" style="s2">and self-destruction that are simply</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.439" end="00:12:39.389" style="s2">anachronistic and the way the trustee</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.699" end="00:12:42.209" style="s2">doe says so I think it&#39;s likely that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.389" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">have a problem with ice cream and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.209" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">people tend to over indulge in things</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">like ice cream because we evolved on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">savanna where you know and we&#39;re mammals</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:57.569" style="s2">so milk yeah right and then lots of fat</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:12:58.139" style="s2">lots of sugar thrown some salt make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.569" end="00:13:00.120" style="s2">cold</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.139" end="00:13:01.589" style="s2">oh my gosh we&#39;ve you&#39;re on the savanna</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.120" end="00:13:02.819" style="s2">so if you&#39;re going to come across</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.589" end="00:13:04.649" style="s2">anything that has any of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.819" end="00:13:06.180" style="s2">properties and and because of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.649" end="00:13:08.009" style="s2">rarity and because of the precariousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:10.769" style="s2">of your life you&#39;re going to gorge on</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.009" end="00:13:13.079" style="s2">them when you see them and that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.769" end="00:13:15.899" style="s2">machinery is still largely in place</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.079" end="00:13:17.840" style="s2">because it only was significantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.899" end="00:13:20.580" style="s2">challenged probably around</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.840" end="00:13:23.270" style="s2">10,000 maybe 20,000 years ago that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.580" end="00:13:25.860" style="s2">long enough revolution to do enough so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.270" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">we have this machinery in us that says</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.860" end="00:13:32.400" style="s2">gorge on the ice-cream and we go into</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">the store the supermarket and because of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.400" end="00:13:39.000" style="s2">runaway capitalism we have 17,000</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:41.280" style="s2">options of ice-cream and you can put in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.000" end="00:13:44.250" style="s2">you can buy them in various overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.280" end="00:13:45.930" style="s2">quantities and eat too much ice cream</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.250" end="00:13:48.410" style="s2">we just need too much ice cream and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.930" end="00:13:55.320" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.410" end="00:13:59.250" style="s2">so I think that I would still want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.320" end="00:14:01.050" style="s2">say that the majority and you see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.250" end="00:14:03.240" style="s2">problem with the plum with saying even</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.050" end="00:14:04.920" style="s2">that that&#39;s that that&#39;s maladaptive it</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.240" end="00:14:07.830" style="s2">is it&#39;s only maladaptive if we have this</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.920" end="00:14:10.110" style="s2">you know complex civilization wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.830" end="00:14:13.470" style="s2">around this civilization collapses god</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.110" end="00:14:16.440" style="s2">forbid then that machinery would again</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.440" end="00:14:20.550" style="s2">way that the subtlety of this I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.270" end="00:14:23.010" style="s2">sometimes you know we want really like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.550" end="00:14:25.280" style="s2">or it&#39;s not that easy there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.010" end="00:14:30.450" style="s2">hypothesis that&#39;s gaining plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.280" end="00:14:32.490" style="s2">that the disorder we call it a disorder</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.450" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">and I mean no moral criticism by this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.490" end="00:14:39.020" style="s2">you know the ADHD hyperactive attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:43.290" style="s2">deficit hyperactive disorder right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">it looks like that that form of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.290" end="00:14:49.950" style="s2">cognition is actually deeply adaptive at</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:54.150" style="s2">- it&#39;s it&#39;s really good in a context of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.950" end="00:14:55.830" style="s2">being a hunter-gatherer and for 99.9% of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.150" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">our history we were hunter-gatherers so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.830" end="00:14:59.460" style="s2">that behavior wouldn&#39;t have been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">disorder it would have been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.460" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">adaptive and probably can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:06.120" style="s2">considerable social social social status</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">on these individuals and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.120" end="00:15:09.750" style="s2">reproductive success which is why this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:11.550" style="s2">form of behavior is so prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.750" end="00:15:12.930" style="s2">it&#39;s just now we wait you take these</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.550" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">individuals we take them out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.930" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies and we stick</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:22.770" style="s2">them in this sedentary suffocating</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:27.330" style="s2">purely you know superficially symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.770" end="00:15:30.579" style="s2">world and they don&#39;t fit in without</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.330" end="00:15:32.799" style="s2">difficulty now is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.579" end="00:15:34.089" style="s2">piece of it being maladaptive is that a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.799" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">case of them suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.089" end="00:15:40.899" style="s2">self-deception it&#39;s very great so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:43.329" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting in this as I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.899" end="00:15:46.649" style="s2">unfold this in a nuanced fashion there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.329" end="00:15:50.499" style="s2">probably a continuum of how we should</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.649" end="00:15:53.709" style="s2">address the question of how adaptive the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.499" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">machinery of self-deception is I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.709" end="00:15:57.610" style="s2">it was always to some degree adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.470" style="s2">because if it wasn&#39;t at least for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.610" end="00:16:01.689" style="s2">significant part of our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.470" end="00:16:04.299" style="s2">heritage adopted it wouldn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.689" end="00:16:06.730" style="s2">motivational compulsion that it does so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.299" end="00:16:08.379" style="s2">maybe thing like that but then you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.730" end="00:16:12.939" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.379" end="00:16:15.970" style="s2">is it even maladaptive don&#39;t know so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.939" end="00:16:19.470" style="s2">question is I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.970" end="00:16:21.309" style="s2">clearly patterns of self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.470" end="00:16:25.209" style="s2">self-destructive behavior that are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.309" end="00:16:28.179" style="s2">running off sort of standard cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.209" end="00:16:29.980" style="s2">biases and heuristics I still think they</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.179" end="00:16:32.920" style="s2">are running off of adaptive machinery</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.980" end="00:16:35.889" style="s2">but how adaptive that machinery is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.920" end="00:16:40.019" style="s2">not a yes/no kind of quantifiable answer</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.889" end="00:16:45.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s relative to our particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.019" end="00:16:48.790" style="s2">historical and environmental context so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.100" end="00:16:51.429" style="s2">I think that does make a difference to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.790" end="00:16:56.759" style="s2">how we try and deal with patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.429" end="00:16:59.079" style="s2">self-deception so there it means and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.759" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">this is this is converted with something</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.079" end="00:17:03.730" style="s2">I have argued that we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:06.039" style="s2">different kinds and this goes back to my</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.730" end="00:17:07.959" style="s2">answer to the first question and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.039" end="00:17:11.319" style="s2">think of different kinds of intervention</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.959" end="00:17:13.689" style="s2">strategies that are working at all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.319" end="00:17:15.309" style="s2">the levels of the stack of the four</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.689" end="00:17:18.429" style="s2">kinds of knowing they can reach down</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.309" end="00:17:21.939" style="s2">into the animal instinct level and up to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.429" end="00:17:26.110" style="s2">our most highest personal cultural level</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.939" end="00:17:29.110" style="s2">of cognition which means and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.110" end="00:17:30.519" style="s2">something that I have been putting quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.110" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">a bit of thought it because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.519" end="00:17:33.399" style="s2">trying to think about the design</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">principles for an ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.399" end="00:17:38.889" style="s2">and we need to have practices that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:40.870" style="s2">complementary complementary</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.889" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">relationships with each other but we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.870" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">also need to have practices that afford</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.580" end="00:17:49.100" style="s2">of the four kinds of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2">layering of practices so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.100" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">be properly exact &#39;add in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:55.130" style="s2">developmental progression so all of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">ties together I wish I could give you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.130" end="00:17:58.970" style="s2">sort of succinct clear answer because</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good question but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:04.730" style="s2">the answer is that we have to posit a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:07.340" style="s2">continuum and then we have to put that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.730" end="00:18:09.530" style="s2">into the dimensions of our design space</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.340" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">for how we try to think about creating</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.530" end="00:18:14.540" style="s2">an ecology of practices so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.440" end="00:18:16.070" style="s2">that most excellent question I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.540" end="00:18:17.660" style="s2">for the rest of you usually oh as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.070" end="00:18:19.610" style="s2">going on so long but I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.660" end="00:18:21.070" style="s2">really important question questions like</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.610" end="00:18:24.070" style="s2">this that go to the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.070" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">self-deception and the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.070" end="00:18:27.890" style="s2">strategies for intervening I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:29.930" style="s2">they&#39;re ones that we shouldn&#39;t we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.890" end="00:18:34.760" style="s2">turn to and keep trying to get better</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.930" end="00:18:38.990" style="s2">and better answers on so Rob gray hi Rob</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.760" end="00:18:40.490" style="s2">I have every month I look forward to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.990" end="00:18:45.190" style="s2">meetings I have with Rob they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.490" end="00:18:49.400" style="s2">they&#39;re wonderful the discussions and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.190" end="00:18:51.650" style="s2">the sense of connection and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.400" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">great to have this ongoing relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.650" end="00:18:56.420" style="s2">with robinus Rob I believe is coming</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:58.670" style="s2">also to the Sangha pretty regularly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.420" end="00:19:01.100" style="s2">just great - Rob asks a really good</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.670" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">question you have any personal observed</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.100" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">dead end practices in other words</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:05.960" style="s2">practices you thought would be fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.340" end="00:19:08.780" style="s2">but waste of your or the practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.960" end="00:19:10.490" style="s2">time are there any practices you used to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.780" end="00:19:12.530" style="s2">do or wish you could do but our two time</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.490" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">resource intensive to do given the rest</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:17.030" style="s2">of your goals this is an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:20.420" style="s2">question the answer is yes it was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.030" end="00:19:22.730" style="s2">practice that I took up that I had such</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.420" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">high expectations for and I pursued it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.730" end="00:19:27.260" style="s2">very diligently and I proceeded at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:29.420" style="s2">couple times in my life the sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.260" end="00:19:31.670" style="s2">practices take at different stages in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.420" end="00:19:33.020" style="s2">your development and so you should come</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.670" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">back to them at some point I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.020" end="00:19:39.230" style="s2">this and this was the practice I read a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:41.570" style="s2">book and I recommend a book because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.230" end="00:19:43.910" style="s2">think this were true for people I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.570" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">I came from the first investment Wagoner</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.910" end="00:19:50.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s about lucid dreaming and and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">saw and I know also about Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.630" end="00:19:55.400" style="s2">traditions that are similar green yoga</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:59.750" style="s2">within Buddhist and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.400" end="00:20:02.059" style="s2">tantric lineages and so I had done some</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.750" end="00:20:05.420" style="s2">earlier lucid dreaming work in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.059" end="00:20:09.230" style="s2">twenties and when I was going through</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.420" end="00:20:11.300" style="s2">Union therapy and I still do sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.230" end="00:20:13.490" style="s2">deep dream work and so that is conducive</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.300" end="00:20:15.320" style="s2">to lucid dreaming and what he proposed</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.490" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">and you know I bought a bunch of books</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.320" end="00:20:20.390" style="s2">on this or various programs to induce</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.710" style="s2">more lucid dreaming and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.390" end="00:20:23.090" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a lot of effort you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.710" end="00:20:24.680" style="s2">do these reality checks throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.090" end="00:20:25.850" style="s2">day as well do these trainings like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.680" end="00:20:30.020" style="s2">was doing it I was being extremely</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.850" end="00:20:31.700" style="s2">diligent my sadistic ego super-ego might</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.020" end="00:20:35.420" style="s2">as well softly also may be sadistic evil</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.700" end="00:20:37.160" style="s2">or my sadistic super-ego you know it one</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.420" end="00:20:39.170" style="s2">fit one of the benefits from it is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.160" end="00:20:41.870" style="s2">tends to make me willing to be very</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.170" end="00:20:43.670" style="s2">diligent in the project yourself self</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.870" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">transformation so I pursued it quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.670" end="00:20:49.309" style="s2">diligently and I not and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">all the books say it takes a long time</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.309" end="00:20:53.750" style="s2">yep and and and that&#39;s true for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:56.570" style="s2">wisdom practices so I hung in and I hung</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.750" end="00:20:59.150" style="s2">in and this is no criticism of this I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.570" end="00:21:01.790" style="s2">know that other people this works for</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.150" end="00:21:03.620" style="s2">them I got one or two lucid dreams the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.790" end="00:21:05.990" style="s2">other thing is I&#39;m a long-term meditator</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.620" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">that&#39;s also deeply predictive of lucid</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.990" end="00:21:11.000" style="s2">dreaming and you know I talked to people</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:14.630" style="s2">about it like my friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.000" end="00:21:16.760" style="s2">Anderson Todd and and I had one lucid</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.630" end="00:21:18.500" style="s2">dream and I had that powerful experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.760" end="00:21:21.350" style="s2">that Wagner talks about I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.500" end="00:21:24.650" style="s2">sort of within the lucid dream talk to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.350" end="00:21:26.929" style="s2">the Dreamweaver and it was oh wow and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.650" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">then you get a sense of you know coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.929" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">into contact with sort of the numinous</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:34.670" style="s2">depths of the psyche and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.670" style="s2">that was it and it just sort of and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.670" end="00:21:39.800" style="s2">was and the cost to benefit ratio was</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.670" end="00:21:42.260" style="s2">just getting diminishing returns I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.800" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">putting more and more time and it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.260" end="00:21:48.820" style="s2">like no that&#39;s it that&#39;s all you get and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.440" end="00:21:51.410" style="s2">I and I I&#39;m not sure why that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.820" end="00:21:53.990" style="s2">so I obviously I haven&#39;t developed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.410" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">expertise in the practice to get a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.990" end="00:21:59.510" style="s2">sense of why it&#39;s not working and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:02.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not because I can&#39;t remember my</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.510" end="00:22:05.090" style="s2">dreams I can all that dream work needs I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.510" end="00:22:10.300" style="s2">can remember like names</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.090" end="00:22:12.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it it&#39;s been disappointing</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.300" end="00:22:16.030" style="s2">it&#39;s just been disappointing because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.920" end="00:22:20.060" style="s2">thought that I saw this as a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.030" end="00:22:23.450" style="s2">plausible way of trying to bring into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.060" end="00:22:25.960" style="s2">naturalistic context some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">theoretic practices from neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.960" end="00:22:32.270" style="s2">and also make another connection between</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:37.490" style="s2">my current practice and uni of practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.270" end="00:22:39.740" style="s2">and it just didn&#39;t gel for me so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.490" end="00:22:42.380" style="s2">reflected on quite a bit why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.740" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">sometimes these things Yelp and why is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.380" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">it sometimes they go and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:52.190" style="s2">that there&#39;s a whole host of reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">none of these are definitive in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.190" end="00:22:58.130" style="s2">it might be that oh I mean sorry this</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:23:00.650" style="s2">sounds oh sorry so try to take this the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.130" end="00:23:03.320" style="s2">right way but it might be by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.650" end="00:23:04.970" style="s2">mycology of practices the the it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.320" end="00:23:08.450" style="s2">complex dynamical system maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.970" end="00:23:11.270" style="s2">working well enough that there really</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.450" end="00:23:12.740" style="s2">wasn&#39;t much of a place for this or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.270" end="00:23:15.320" style="s2">not getting much of a functional purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.740" end="00:23:18.230" style="s2">purchase or it could be that I have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.320" end="00:23:20.900" style="s2">resistance to it that because of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.230" end="00:23:23.990" style="s2">videos in chronic background perhaps my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.900" end="00:23:26.300" style="s2">my particular you know religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.990" end="00:23:28.160" style="s2">heritage is somehow interfering on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.300" end="00:23:30.620" style="s2">level I&#39;m not aware of perhaps it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.160" end="00:23:36.380" style="s2">age I&#39;m getting older and so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.620" end="00:23:38.150" style="s2">capacity for that kind of vivid imagery</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.380" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2">is stunning to say to me which is also</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.150" end="00:23:42.590" style="s2">makes things like active imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.860" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">more of a challenge for me so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.590" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">know but the thing to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:52.430" style="s2">is again first of all what I said before</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:54.410" style="s2">if a practice doesn&#39;t work but you had</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.430" end="00:23:56.510" style="s2">some sort of intuitive sense try it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.410" end="00:23:58.490" style="s2">again at another at significantly other</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.510" end="00:24:00.680" style="s2">time another point in your life because</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.490" end="00:24:04.010" style="s2">it might be just your the idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.680" end="00:24:09.160" style="s2">place in your psychobiological</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.010" end="00:24:11.180" style="s2">development but it also might be that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.160" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">certain things won&#39;t work for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.180" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">because of sort of more permanent</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">conditions within you or also because</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:24.609" style="s2">like I say the relative success of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.859" end="00:24:28.779" style="s2">functionality of other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.609" end="00:24:29.230" style="s2">happening for you so it should have</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.779" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.230" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">all the predictors I did all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:34.359" style="s2">research all the particulars there I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.850" style="s2">all and it just didn&#39;t gel for me and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.359" end="00:24:41.889" style="s2">I hope it&#39;s helpful for people to hear</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.850" end="00:24:44.649" style="s2">that because what was helpful for me he</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.889" end="00:24:48.429" style="s2">was wrestling with the fact I of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.649" end="00:24:52.149" style="s2">I was disappointed because I saw it as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.429" end="00:24:53.739" style="s2">potentially powerful II but also to step</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.149" end="00:24:56.529" style="s2">back and realize well there might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.739" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">good reasons also why it&#39;s not taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.529" end="00:25:00.970" style="s2">for me or there might be reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:04.539" style="s2">have to do with my mortality that I need</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.970" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">to deeply accept and so I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.539" end="00:25:12.129" style="s2">a very helpful question Robin I hope I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.350" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">was able to answer it about once I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.129" end="00:25:18.279" style="s2">wish I could do more I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:20.769" style="s2">take up sacred geometry which was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.279" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">practice of sort of doing a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.769" end="00:25:28.419" style="s2">as you&#39;re sort of doing geometric proofs</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">sort of Allah you cleared it was part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.419" end="00:25:32.590" style="s2">the Neoplatonic heritage because I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:36.549" style="s2">a strong suspicion that sacred geometry</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.590" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">really bridges powerfully and extends</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.549" end="00:25:42.100" style="s2">rationality through that bridging</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">between propositional and prospective of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.100" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">knowing because of the way geometry</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:49.960" style="s2">brings in perspective and shape and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:52.269" style="s2">construction procedural element but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:25:55.029" style="s2">also deeply rational and inferential</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.269" end="00:25:58.119" style="s2">and analytic but I just don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.029" end="00:25:59.649" style="s2">time to undertake it right now so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.119" end="00:26:00.970" style="s2">was another great question deserving of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.649" end="00:26:06.190" style="s2">a long answer and I hope you found that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.970" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">helpful Rob next question is from</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.190" end="00:26:14.350" style="s2">another patron I believe is Janet</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.669" end="00:27:17.169" style="s2">because that&#39;s how all the models are</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.409" end="00:27:22.610" style="s2">being generated in terms of language I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.169" end="00:27:27.429" style="s2">had an impact on me and part of it is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.610" end="00:27:30.679" style="s2">think my upbringing I was my father was</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.429" end="00:27:32.929" style="s2">quite absent I don&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.679" end="00:27:37.370" style="s2">with us but he was all like not present</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.929" end="00:27:40.429" style="s2">for a lot and so I was very much brought</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.370" end="00:27:46.659" style="s2">up in a household of women my mother and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.429" end="00:27:53.270" style="s2">three sisters and so they taught me very</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.659" end="00:27:55.490" style="s2">deeply that I should treat them even</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.270" end="00:27:57.380" style="s2">saying this feels wrong but I should</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.490" end="00:27:59.090" style="s2">look I shouldn&#39;t have to say it or even</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.380" end="00:28:02.600" style="s2">it sounds even pretentious to be saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.090" end="00:28:07.640" style="s2">it but they taught me that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.600" end="00:28:09.049" style="s2">I should treat them as whole persons and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.640" end="00:28:11.419" style="s2">I don&#39;t need to say that they sacked me</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.049" end="00:28:14.630" style="s2">down and oh no it just it was like it</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.419" end="00:28:18.200" style="s2">was like an atmosphere around me that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.630" end="00:28:21.020" style="s2">just internalized a very significant I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.900" end="00:28:33.950" style="s2">was brought up in a certain way it</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.610" end="00:28:38.179" style="s2">helped me to realize things and then I</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.950" end="00:28:41.510" style="s2">noticed that and I&#39;m also as I have</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.530" end="00:29:25.780" style="s2">wanted to try and make my work more</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.840" end="00:29:27.430" style="s2">inclusive of women not just because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.780" end="00:29:30.070" style="s2">my upbringing but also something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.430" end="00:29:31.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed in my classrooms so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.070" end="00:29:34.150" style="s2">important to set up the culture of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.450" end="00:29:38.010" style="s2">classroom very well and so for many</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.150" end="00:29:40.810" style="s2">years now I make an explicit statement</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.010" end="00:29:43.990" style="s2">asking women to participate more in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.810" end="00:29:45.430" style="s2">class and I don&#39;t have any hard class</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.990" end="00:29:47.650" style="s2">scientific evidence about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.430" end="00:29:49.780" style="s2">have reliable and internal evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.650" end="00:29:53.080" style="s2">when I do that more women participate</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.780" end="00:29:57.130" style="s2">and then what I inevitably find is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.080" end="00:29:59.710" style="s2">class goes better for everybody and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.130" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">it came to my mind that that would also</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.710" end="00:30:03.580" style="s2">be the case for but if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:05.560" style="s2">the analogy and I don&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.580" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">pretentious fire but that would make</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.560" end="00:30:13.150" style="s2">this classroom go better and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:15.670" style="s2">wanted as much as fossil fuel be</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.150" end="00:30:19.030" style="s2">inclusive in that way I want to be as</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.670" end="00:30:21.250" style="s2">inclusive as it&#39;s possible in all ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.030" end="00:30:22.930" style="s2">but I&#39;m addressing a specific thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.250" end="00:30:26.050" style="s2">right now and like I say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.930" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">particularly sensitive to it because of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.050" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">my upbringing and then like I said the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:34.180" style="s2">influence of some pretty powerful works</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:35.890" style="s2">of science fiction that really called</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.180" end="00:30:38.280" style="s2">this out for me I&#39;ve also had the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.890" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2">reverse experience when when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.280" end="00:30:43.540" style="s2">teenager I read stranger in a strange</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:45.280" style="s2">land by Robert Heinlein and it may put</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.540" end="00:30:47.260" style="s2">an impact on me in the notion of rocking</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:49.870" style="s2">things sort of my first introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.260" end="00:30:55.300" style="s2">you know what ultimately turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.870" end="00:30:56.980" style="s2">a Neoplatonic idea of new synthesis so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.300" end="00:30:59.080" style="s2">decided as an out okay I go back</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.980" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">we I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t read that book</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.080" end="00:31:04.210" style="s2">I was I was about you know 30 or 40</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">pages in and is it&#39;s so incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.210" end="00:31:09.250" style="s2">sexist and there&#39;s a figure in there</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.540" end="00:31:16.809" style="s2">it&#39;s just ah</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.250" end="00:31:18.520" style="s2">and so I like I said I&#39;ve had both</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.809" end="00:31:21.010" style="s2">positive it I have very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.520" end="00:31:23.530" style="s2">positive and negative experiences around</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.010" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">its any particular in science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.530" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">and perhaps that&#39;s because science</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">fiction is the genre I know what to put</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:34.630" style="s2">down on but oh who reads that right</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:36.460" style="s2">except look around look around you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.630" end="00:31:39.400" style="s2">why because science fiction is a genre</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.460" end="00:31:41.799" style="s2">that in which the main character is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.400" end="00:31:44.860" style="s2">any person the main character is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.799" end="00:31:46.630" style="s2">world so science fiction is the form of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.860" end="00:31:49.330" style="s2">fiction that is most playful</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.630" end="00:31:52.150" style="s2">of our worldviews and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.330" end="00:31:54.280" style="s2">actually deeply relevant to the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.150" end="00:31:56.620" style="s2">of wisdom and the transformation of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.280" end="00:31:59.350" style="s2">fundamental understanding of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.620" end="00:32:01.030" style="s2">and reality and so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.350" end="00:32:03.610" style="s2">any coincidence that both my most</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.030" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">positive and negative interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.610" end="00:32:10.780" style="s2">the phenomena ask me about head comic</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:14.470" style="s2">science fiction so that&#39;s sort of the is</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.470" end="00:32:20.380" style="s2">my pedagogical motivation for why I try</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:24.250" style="s2">to be so sensitive about this and well I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.380" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">think we should all make an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.250" end="00:32:30.130" style="s2">address this it concerns me for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:32.919" style="s2">and then what I can&#39;t do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.130" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">it and it concerns me that you know most</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.919" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">of the people that I talked about in</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:41.260" style="s2">historically were men but if you notice</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.260" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">cutting edge stuff the figures that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.480" end="00:32:48.280" style="s2">most influential in my thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:50.919" style="s2">now like la Paul and Agnes Callen and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.280" end="00:32:53.380" style="s2">Iris Murdoch are all women and that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.919" end="00:32:55.990" style="s2">coincidence either because just like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.380" end="00:32:59.290" style="s2">classroom if we bring in the women</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.990" end="00:33:02.770" style="s2">everybody benefits everybody benefits I</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.290" end="00:33:07.090" style="s2">wish we could get past this I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.770" end="00:33:09.710" style="s2">largely useless you know polarization on</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.090" end="00:33:12.590" style="s2">this sorry but</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.270" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">world network information of communities</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.820" end="00:36:21.230" style="s2">and so I&#39;m also getting on trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.310" end="00:36:26.090" style="s2">deeply involved with community building</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:30.140" style="s2">and then this takes me to something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.090" end="00:36:33.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about which is well</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.140" end="00:36:40.630" style="s2">two things bridging all over this</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.400" end="00:36:44.200" style="s2">verbiage right with art and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.630" end="00:36:47.800" style="s2">hear the dawn recently and this was on</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.200" end="00:36:50.570" style="s2">also screwed together in stone has taken</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.800" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">some of my work and I&#39;ll talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.570" end="00:36:55.240" style="s2">it is in a second and then put it into</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:57.950" style="s2">meaning way putting it to use it and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.240" end="00:37:00.860" style="s2">disseminating these ideas artistically</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.950" end="00:37:05.090" style="s2">through popular culture I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.860" end="00:37:08.930" style="s2">important but it has to be growing I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.090" end="00:37:11.720" style="s2">mean it has to be handled like in a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.930" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">so keep it love me if we you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.720" end="00:37:16.040" style="s2">to speak a little provocatively how do</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">we propagate ideas without getting into</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.040" end="00:37:23.930" style="s2">propaganda and my hope is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:26.330" style="s2">artistic expertise</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.930" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">dissemination of the ideas will keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.330" end="00:37:31.820" style="s2">close pace and be constrained by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:36.170" style="s2">degree to which communities are forming</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.820" end="00:37:38.359" style="s2">and networking into higher art of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.170" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">you know not a hierarchy like I said</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.359" end="00:37:42.980" style="s2">annex what I want an extended small</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.980" end="00:37:47.000" style="s2">what I want to do and this is what Acura</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:50.650" style="s2">the dawn put to music is I want to steal</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.000" end="00:37:55.819" style="s2">the culture and what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.650" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">what I mean by that is I&#39;m not try I my</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">issues of policy my position is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.020" end="00:38:05.390" style="s2">ultimately not political it&#39;s meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:07.910" style="s2">political I think exact time for</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.390" end="00:38:09.109" style="s2">pointing that out to me because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.910" end="00:38:12.980" style="s2">want something like the French</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.109" end="00:38:15.020" style="s2">Revolution or you know the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.980" end="00:38:16.670" style="s2">Revolution or the Chinese Revolution or</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.020" end="00:38:18.619" style="s2">the Iranian Revolution these revolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.670" end="00:38:21.940" style="s2">revolutions have not generally turned</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.619" end="00:38:24.589" style="s2">out to be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.940" end="00:38:27.579" style="s2">political revolutions but I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.589" end="00:38:30.230" style="s2">something like with the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.579" end="00:38:32.809" style="s2">well what we got were in the combination</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.230" end="00:38:37.160" style="s2">of the Renaissance the Reformation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.809" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">the Scientific Revolution but my primary</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.160" end="00:38:42.680" style="s2">model that sort of splits the difference</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:47.900" style="s2">between them is what you saw in</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.680" end="00:38:50.270" style="s2">Christianity Christianity didn&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.900" end="00:38:53.059" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t a political revolution to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.270" end="00:38:55.099" style="s2">try and like topple the government or</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.059" end="00:38:57.950" style="s2">anything like that and not because there</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.099" end="00:38:59.720" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been Slade revelations in Rome</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.950" end="00:39:03.730" style="s2">that person had been Spartacus comes to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.720" end="00:39:07.549" style="s2">mind but instead what happened was they</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.730" end="00:39:09.859" style="s2">they built a new way of being and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.549" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">a new ecology of practices and that was</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.859" end="00:39:14.559" style="s2">commensurate with community building and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:17.240" style="s2">it was commensurate with artistic</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.240" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">and what happened is this networked out</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:27.109" style="s2">and in a bottom-up fashion the culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:28.970" style="s2">shifted until the state which have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.109" end="00:39:31.700" style="s2">even trying to oppress and suppress</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.970" end="00:39:34.849" style="s2">Christianity had to had to accommodate</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.369" end="00:40:04.899" style="s2">is an argument made by Tom Horner but</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.169" end="00:40:06.719" style="s2">before right that that Christian will</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.409" end="00:40:45.069" style="s2">culture had fundamentally shifted and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.179" end="00:40:47.949" style="s2">I think I think we&#39;re at a point in</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.329" end="00:41:55.299" style="s2">at least in the West</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.920" end="00:42:12.730" style="s2">gathered the candles of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:15.070" style="s2">knowledge and the new forms of</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.260" end="00:42:39.640" style="s2">then we have to be able to connect to</p>

<p begin="00:42:46.930" end="00:42:53.140" style="s2">time for larger visions because and</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.140" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">me because you know we do need larger</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.869" end="00:45:28.030" style="s2">would be to try to separate out these</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.780" end="00:45:29.410" style="s2">various things in your mind because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.030" end="00:45:31.240" style="s2">do have a tendency for what&#39;s called</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:45.130" style="s2">if you could sort of pull them apart</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.950" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">because you need to respond to them in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.130" end="00:45:58.780" style="s2">different ways so there is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:46:05.230" style="s2">anyone can say to you about grief other</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.450" end="00:46:43.620" style="s2">that the size of the hole that grief</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.620" end="00:46:51.290" style="s2">don&#39;t really get rid of that hole what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.370" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">you do is you grow a self and the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.290" end="00:46:57.780" style="s2">that is more encompassing such that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:47:03.540" style="s2">hole is comparatively not as large in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.780" end="00:47:06.600" style="s2">you but it if the idea is I will stop</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.540" end="00:47:09.410" style="s2">missing my father that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.600" end="00:47:12.300" style="s2">happen and you wouldn&#39;t want to be</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.300" end="00:47:20.150" style="s2">incapable of grief the kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:23.640" style="s2">that would stop remembering your father</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.150" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">what does happen and there&#39;s no quick</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.640" end="00:47:28.460" style="s2">way through this any of the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">short-circuit grief are damaging or</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.460" end="00:47:41.070" style="s2">damaging what can happen though as I say</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:44.250" style="s2">is if in community with others grow into</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.070" end="00:47:47.550" style="s2">a different more expansive person in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.250" end="00:47:52.470" style="s2">deeper world is in that hole only in</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.550" end="00:47:57.120" style="s2">comparison shrinks then the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.470" end="00:48:00.570" style="s2">which you relive your relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.120" end="00:48:04.860" style="s2">your father diminishes so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.570" end="00:48:07.860" style="s2">have to be as biting to you it will</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.860" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">always I predict we&#39;re always come with</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.860" end="00:48:15.150" style="s2">a sense of loss but right now that sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">of loss is tending to mas you know a</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.150" end="00:48:22.470" style="s2">more a fuller picture of your father the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:24.780" style="s2">loss the loss of super salient to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.470" end="00:48:27.930" style="s2">right now and so the salience of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.780" end="00:48:30.630" style="s2">loss through this comparative shrinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.930" end="00:48:33.930" style="s2">of the hole in your world because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.630" end="00:48:38.220" style="s2">what a death is every person is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.930" end="00:48:39.960" style="s2">doorway to a way of being in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.220" end="00:48:41.430" style="s2">being in the universe and the way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.960" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">being inside of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.430" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">right your father is a doorway into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:48.840" style="s2">depths of your psyche and it was away</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.500" end="00:48:51.480" style="s2">and your your father you know as a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.840" end="00:48:55.640" style="s2">of for you seeing into the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.480" end="00:49:01.020" style="s2">world and that is taken away it&#39;s a cap</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:06.349" style="s2">so the loss is super salient to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.020" end="00:49:10.920" style="s2">right now but if you go through this</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.349" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">long process what could happen is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.920" end="00:49:16.830" style="s2">loss isn&#39;t so super salient and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:20.250" style="s2">that whole it is such a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.830" end="00:49:23.550" style="s2">privation right now does it it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.250" end="00:49:26.369" style="s2">less comprehensive in your experience of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.550" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">the world and of yourself and other</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.369" end="00:49:31.470" style="s2">other aspects in which your dad is woven</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:33.960" style="s2">into that come to the fore for you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.470" end="00:49:35.580" style="s2">then you start to experience again this</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.960" end="00:49:37.859" style="s2">won&#39;t happen this will not happen soon</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.580" end="00:49:40.920" style="s2">but you start to experience gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.859" end="00:49:42.750" style="s2">and also forgiveness for the ways you</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.920" end="00:49:47.490" style="s2">that might have hurt you</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.750" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s about the grief about your</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.490" end="00:50:02.190" style="s2">expecting your child there&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.340" end="00:52:31.830" style="s2">adaptivity so those are things you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:33.000" style="s2">do so try to keep the problems separate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.830" end="00:52:34.520" style="s2">and because there are different</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.000" end="00:52:41.430" style="s2">strategies for the different problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.520" end="00:52:43.860" style="s2">and I hope that was helpful for you it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.430" end="00:52:46.560" style="s2">won&#39;t always be the way it is now and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.860" end="00:52:52.890" style="s2">know that&#39;s a stupid least simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.560" end="00:52:53.910" style="s2">proposition but if you start to do some</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.890" end="00:52:57.270" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s I&#39;m recommending</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.910" end="00:53:00.690" style="s2">what you want to do is can you start to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.270" end="00:53:03.190" style="s2">get a taste of the future you won&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.190" end="00:53:07.960" style="s2">nothing&#39;s that up sleep in but if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.560" end="00:53:11.500" style="s2">can start to get a taste of the future</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.960" end="00:53:16.630" style="s2">that that acts as a powerful reminder</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.500" end="00:53:20.110" style="s2">not just in thought but in the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.630" end="00:53:22.060" style="s2">of your being that it won&#39;t always be</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.110" end="00:53:22.620" style="s2">this way and you won&#39;t always be this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.060" end="00:53:26.820" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.620" end="00:53:29.340" style="s2">don&#39;t give in to reciprocal narrowing I</p>

<p begin="00:54:25.810" end="00:54:31.800" style="s2">towards that sort of meta point and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.020" end="00:54:35.460" style="s2">one I like to return to again and again</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.800" end="00:54:41.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s one that our culture keeps</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.460" end="00:54:44.200" style="s2">forgetting there are so here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.650" end="00:54:46.690" style="s2">Tillich is very helpful to me we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.200" end="00:54:51.730" style="s2">always pulled between individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.690" end="00:54:55.360" style="s2">participation and there and when if the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.730" end="00:54:58.090" style="s2">individual Asian pole is too strong we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.360" end="00:55:03.100" style="s2">can become autodidactic and then we fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.090" end="00:55:06.520" style="s2">prey to bias and self-deception but if</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.100" end="00:55:09.690" style="s2">the participation pole is too strong we</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.520" end="00:55:12.250" style="s2">can fall prey to cult-like behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.690" end="00:55:15.630" style="s2">groupthink and diffusion of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.250" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">responsibility and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.630" end="00:55:23.610" style="s2">like Brazil I grew up in such a</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">situation and I found it quite hurtful</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.610" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">and to some degree traumatized it to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:37.710" style="s2">and so the answer is that you we need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:40.230" style="s2">create and this is telling sensors on my</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.710" end="00:55:42.750" style="s2">answer we need to create persons within</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.230" end="00:55:45.600" style="s2">a community with it we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.750" end="00:55:48.320" style="s2">persons within a community that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.600" end="00:55:52.470" style="s2">committed to the creation of persons</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.320" end="00:55:55.710" style="s2">which means that we what should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.470" end="00:55:58.530" style="s2">foremost in any community we want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.710" end="00:56:04.170" style="s2">belong to is a recognition of these two</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.530" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">polar dangers that we want people to</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.170" end="00:56:10.860" style="s2">have ongoing and richly rewarding access</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:16.230" style="s2">to distributed cognition but we also</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.860" end="00:56:19.260" style="s2">want people to be able to to hold it</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.230" end="00:56:21.900" style="s2">they when they need to individuate pull</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.260" end="00:56:26.040" style="s2">apart and offer critical reflection upon</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.900" end="00:56:28.740" style="s2">group dynamics and we want individuals</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.040" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">who have been brought up to respect what</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.740" end="00:56:34.830" style="s2">the community has to say but also</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">because the community has been committed</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.830" end="00:56:40.410" style="s2">to a process of self correction be</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">encouraged to participate in the self</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.410" end="00:56:45.840" style="s2">correction machinery other community</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:47.850" style="s2">this was supposed to be and when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.840" end="00:56:50.100" style="s2">redo it I mean that we could do what</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.850" end="00:56:52.920" style="s2">Duty is are you John Dewey the American</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.100" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">private is philosopher and educate an</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.920" end="00:57:00.660" style="s2">educational thinker I mean this is what</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:57:02.190" style="s2">the but you know Julie saw that these</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.660" end="00:57:03.300" style="s2">two things were supposed to always be</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.190" end="00:57:08.220" style="s2">together there&#39;s these two great</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.300" end="00:57:09.720" style="s2">self-correcting systems we have science</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.220" end="00:57:12.390" style="s2">is a self-correcting system and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.720" end="00:57:14.490" style="s2">democracy and the idea is and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.390" end="00:57:18.120" style="s2">why they tend to know well together is</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.490" end="00:57:20.120" style="s2">to both self-correcting systems and when</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.120" end="00:57:22.110" style="s2">people are in them they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.120" end="00:57:26.220" style="s2">self-correcting systems of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.110" end="00:57:28.500" style="s2">cognition that nevertheless in</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.220" end="00:57:31.430" style="s2">individuals to try and make a critical</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.500" end="00:57:35.430" style="s2">difference and that encourage</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.430" end="00:57:37.650" style="s2">individuals to be different from those</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.430" end="00:57:40.950" style="s2">around them and so in democracy we try</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.650" end="00:57:43.380" style="s2">to balance the power of the majority off</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.950" end="00:57:47.150" style="s2">against constitutional rights of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.380" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">individual and that&#39;s how and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.150" end="00:57:52.710" style="s2">scientific practice we you know we you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:53.700" style="s2">have peer review and all this thing all</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.710" end="00:57:56.070" style="s2">these things but the individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.700" end="00:57:58.200" style="s2">scientists and the individual lab can is</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.070" end="00:58:00.600" style="s2">basically doing their own thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.200" end="00:58:01.860" style="s2">where there&#39;s that constant and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.600" end="00:58:03.990" style="s2">these two things were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.860" end="00:58:07.730" style="s2">self-correct on each other so science</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.990" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">science was most do not be commodified</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.730" end="00:58:14.370" style="s2">right and become largely driven by you</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.640" end="00:58:17.880" style="s2">know funding and sort of publication</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.370" end="00:58:20.100" style="s2">motives that are external to the quest</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.880" end="00:58:22.140" style="s2">for knowledge and was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.100" end="00:58:24.600" style="s2">held in check by sort of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.140" end="00:58:27.210" style="s2">constantly remind reminding science of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.600" end="00:58:29.610" style="s2">its commitment to the community at large</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.210" end="00:58:32.790" style="s2">and then if democracy was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.610" end="00:58:35.700" style="s2">responsive to the way which science gave</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.790" end="00:58:37.650" style="s2">us facts and information and whether or</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.700" end="00:58:41.610" style="s2">not that&#39;s the case right now of course</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.650" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">is highly questionable but it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.610" end="00:58:46.650" style="s2">possible that there happen it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:50.100" style="s2">possible that given what Dewey has</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.650" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">argued that we can get a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.100" end="00:58:56.850" style="s2">system of opponent processing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:59.700" style="s2">optimizes the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.850" end="00:59:02.340" style="s2">individuation of participation so that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.700" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">we can constantly steer between and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.340" end="00:59:08.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what every virtue does it steers</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">you between you know particular vices of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.550" end="00:59:14.280" style="s2">excess or deficit we can get a virtue a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:18.120" style="s2">virtual engine that steers us between</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.280" end="00:59:22.260" style="s2">other didacticism and group thing so</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.120" end="00:59:24.330" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s very much on my</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.260" end="00:59:27.540" style="s2">mind and the mind of people I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.330" end="00:59:31.340" style="s2">with I know in this in trying to do this</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.340" end="00:59:36.600" style="s2">what role does temporality play in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.650" end="00:59:38.100" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and agogic paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.600" end="00:59:38.650" style="s2">the Attic seems to lack vision or even</p>

<p begin="00:59:40.750" end="00:59:46.450" style="s2">directly right Pete I think that when</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.450" end="00:59:50.680" style="s2">narrowing and the world can&#39;t be any</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.190" end="01:05:07.810" style="s2">something like quantum computation but</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.619" end="01:05:10.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve now seen some arguments that look</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.810" end="01:05:12.970" style="s2">like they&#39;re almost a priori arguments</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.510" end="01:05:15.400" style="s2">then even quantum computation can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.340" end="01:05:27.520" style="s2">really an open question I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.580" end="01:05:29.560" style="s2">classical machines will ever get to that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.520" end="01:05:32.490" style="s2">possibility and I think it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:05:32.490" end="01:05:37.660" style="s2">machines will but what we could say in</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:39.609" style="s2">answer to question is they certainly</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.660" end="01:05:42.100" style="s2">could maybe explore the space get to a</p>
