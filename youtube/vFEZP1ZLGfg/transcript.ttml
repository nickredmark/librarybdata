<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:56.729" style="s2">issues I guess there&#39;s the biological</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.059" end="00:00:59.729" style="s2">reproductive notion of gender right</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.729" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">sexual the necessary necessity for sex</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.729" end="00:01:06.090" style="s2">is to create variation this is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">then there is the cultural construct of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.090" end="00:01:12.690" style="s2">gender assigning characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">roles to people based if not entirely</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:29.549" style="s2">ways so there&#39;s that but then umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">in both of those is the the eternal</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:34.859" style="s2">right that the first division if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">were one of the first divisions of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.859" end="00:01:50.090" style="s2">like have equated in to the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">and the feminine it&#39;s interesting we</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.090" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">assign all sorts of genders especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">not in English languages like French and</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:05.789" style="s2">all sorts of things and and it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">difficult really to unravel what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.789" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">really going on when we say the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">Feminine or the masculine and start to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">assign these things to different genders</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:20.069" style="s2">for us in fact when we look at gender in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">humanity those divisions don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.069" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">seem to well perhaps they they apply</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:30.450" style="s2">some more stereotypically but they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.400" style="s2">often broken within the stereotype one</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.450" end="00:02:34.549" style="s2">wonders how</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">how how useful it is really to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.549" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">those individual divisions according to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">agenda yeah it&#39;s the it&#39;s the conflation</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:53.299" style="s2">of the masculine and the feminine with</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:55.190" style="s2">the man and the woman it&#39;s a failure to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.299" end="00:02:58.099" style="s2">recognize that the masculine and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.190" end="00:03:03.799" style="s2">feminine reside in both men and women</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.099" end="00:03:07.910" style="s2">right and that the biological necessity</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.799" end="00:03:10.819" style="s2">for having men and women necessitates</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.910" end="00:03:13.879" style="s2">certain physical differences right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.819" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">so there are stereotypical physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.879" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">differences women have more fat in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">bodies women are generally shorter</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.829" style="s2">weaker and so on of course you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.810" style="s2">always find examples of peak tall strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.829" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">women and short weak men of course that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.810" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">is that if that is the case but broadly</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:31.730" style="s2">speaking and so part of the gender</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:34.760" style="s2">assignation that has gone on it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.730" end="00:03:37.069" style="s2">surely due to this biological thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:43.069" style="s2">because men are stronger they do more</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.069" end="00:03:46.639" style="s2">physical labor for example some</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.069" end="00:03:48.200" style="s2">interesting things especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.639" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">go to something like the yin and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.200" end="00:03:53.269" style="s2">yang and they talk about the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:55.669" style="s2">and the masculine where where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.269" end="00:03:58.180" style="s2">masculine perhaps represents order and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.669" end="00:04:02.810" style="s2">light and force and the feminine action</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.180" end="00:04:04.849" style="s2">represent chaos and negative things so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.810" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely this extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.849" end="00:04:13.480" style="s2">interesting thing perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:13.480" style="s2">unfortunate perhaps is unfortunate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">feminine the masculine are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.950" end="00:04:24.199" style="s2">separate rather than opposite ends of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:32.900" style="s2">scale in which we we enjoy all sorts of</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.900" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">rather than saying masculine is like</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.419" end="00:04:51.560" style="s2">as with any duality it is what it is the</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.560" end="00:04:57.470" style="s2">is is one of the ways subjects an object</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.849" end="00:05:09.620" style="s2">polarities that we use to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.770" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">the world the difficulties arise when</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.620" end="00:05:16.190" style="s2">you start assigning virtuous or evil</p>
