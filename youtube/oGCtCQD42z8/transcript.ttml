<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">bring language to for this together so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:42.040" style="s2">would imagine I can kind of almost feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:44.590" style="s2">like if we&#39;re talking about I could kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.040" end="00:04:46.900" style="s2">of feel his hand right underneath</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.590" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">underneath underneath that kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.900" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">that possible I mean I read some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:53.590" style="s2">stuff that he&#39;s in what people have said</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">about him for one it&#39;s like depending on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.590" end="00:04:58.150" style="s2">who&#39;s describing them it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">Gurdjieff which is fascinating hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:04.140" style="s2">and and some of the stuff oh my god this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">is really kind of out there and strange</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.140" end="00:05:12.910" style="s2">at a Content level but like but just</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:15.640" style="s2">this notion of that that a person who</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.910" end="00:05:18.460" style="s2">works and is in the world he can</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.640" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">actually treat transcendence in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.460" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">meaningful ways if that wasn&#39;t even a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">consideration before like it seems like</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.050" end="00:07:09.530" style="s2">phrase you used in one of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:13.370" style="s2">conversations with Jordan I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.530" end="00:07:16.759" style="s2">secure attachment mmhmm yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.370" end="00:07:18.740" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s novel</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.759" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">again that&#39;s like something I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.740" end="00:07:28.669" style="s2">think that that could happen to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.650" end="00:07:30.110" style="s2">like me yeah I would imagine it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.669" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">funny because he talked about being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">walker between worlds and wanderer and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">said I can&#39;t help but think of Hermes</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:41.900" style="s2">right like Hermes is you know the it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:45.050" style="s2">Hermes is this kind of unique God you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.900" end="00:07:48.340" style="s2">know herb you nedick&#39;s like like the you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.050" end="00:07:51.770" style="s2">know the kind of God of language which</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.340" end="00:07:54.440" style="s2">which is this in-between world right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.770" end="00:07:56.900" style="s2">Hermes isn&#39;t like is not completely a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.440" end="00:08:01.699" style="s2">god and not not completely human but</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.900" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">this this between worlds but like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.699" end="00:08:06.409" style="s2">home is the place where they</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">paradoxically come together so language</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.409" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">right so it&#39;s on one level it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.690" end="00:08:13.580" style="s2">language is very paradoxical obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:15.620" style="s2">because it&#39;s like the word isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.580" end="00:08:17.779" style="s2">thing that it describes yet it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.620" end="00:08:18.620" style="s2">thing available and it couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.779" end="00:08:23.509" style="s2">without it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.620" end="00:08:27.409" style="s2">that whole home homelessness kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.509" end="00:08:30.529" style="s2">thing and I think I think it was I in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.409" end="00:08:34.219" style="s2">I think it was Hillman pointed this out</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.529" end="00:08:38.140" style="s2">I think it was Hillman where he talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.219" end="00:08:38.140" style="s2">about it&#39;s interesting he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.169" end="00:08:46.279" style="s2">that Hermes I think mythically is wedded</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.070" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">to Hestia or one of the goddesses that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.279" end="00:08:52.500" style="s2">is the goddess of domesticity</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:58.019" style="s2">right and he and he talked about like in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.500" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">his clinical practice where how if home</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.019" end="00:09:04.620" style="s2">if Hermes goes manic and like divorces</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:09.149" style="s2">his wife you end up with these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.620" end="00:09:11.220" style="s2">poo air yeah like you know boys you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.149" end="00:09:12.899" style="s2">or Icarus going you know flying too</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.220" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">close to the Sun and then falling right</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.899" end="00:09:19.139" style="s2">you both but when hermes is in right</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:23.910" style="s2">relationship right it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.139" end="00:09:28.139" style="s2">like how this this this homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.910" end="00:09:31.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s is wedded to domesticity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.139" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">so when you said truly yeah that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.560" end="00:09:39.930" style="s2">very trying yeah my life it also made me</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">think of you know the Buddhist teacher</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.930" end="00:09:43.320" style="s2">took him trippy he talks about you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">if you become a Buddhist you take refuge</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.320" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">in being homeless so so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">sort of like was the sort of paradox is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.500" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">is like is like okay you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:55.829" style="s2">be attached to some place but at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:10:00.570" style="s2">same time you&#39;re making a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.829" end="00:10:04.110" style="s2">something yeah um yes say that against</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.570" end="00:10:08.310" style="s2">it so that kind of hit me being refuge</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.110" end="00:10:10.890" style="s2">to how did you put that well you take</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.310" end="00:10:14.100" style="s2">refuge is like a traditional Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.890" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">thing right you take refuge in and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.100" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">take refuge in being homeless right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">not being attached to you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:24.180" style="s2">different levels of it not attached to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.820" end="00:10:27.449" style="s2">place but also not attached to an</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.180" end="00:10:28.920" style="s2">identity or not attached to something at</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.449" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.920" end="00:10:35.209" style="s2">commitment so so I guess that&#39;s the did</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:42.660" style="s2">that when I thought of the domesticity</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.209" end="00:10:44.940" style="s2">and the let&#39;s say the wildness me being</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.660" end="00:10:48.300" style="s2">and creating something that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.940" end="00:10:51.810" style="s2">alive does that not make sense totally</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.300" end="00:10:55.529" style="s2">well I would imagine in some level you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.810" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">know there&#39;s you know if I look if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.529" end="00:10:59.880" style="s2">watch you for example like all of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:01.800" style="s2">sudden kind of hearing I get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.880" end="00:11:02.150" style="s2">of like oh yeah but maybe the right cuz</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.800" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">I know</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.150" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">for me marriage and this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:10.520" style="s2">never had secure attachment before yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:13.460" style="s2">no well yeah I didn&#39;t like until I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.520" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">it I was I I started to experience it I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.460" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">was like whoa what the hell is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:21.740" style="s2">right this is what I used to what used</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">to look like prison to me feels like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.740" end="00:11:26.360" style="s2">deepest freedom in the world right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:29.300" style="s2">you know and one of those so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.360" end="00:11:34.430" style="s2">simple but but I kind of got this sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.300" end="00:11:35.960" style="s2">of oh yeah like the right thing goes in</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.430" end="00:11:40.580" style="s2">the center of the mandala and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.960" end="00:11:44.510" style="s2">whole mandala yeah I think right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.580" end="00:11:47.300" style="s2">I know yeah I just kind of got that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.510" end="00:11:49.190" style="s2">sense of just like here you are like on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.300" end="00:11:51.740" style="s2">some level one at least my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.190" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">you is your things are gathering around</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.740" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2">you like your channels right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:12:01.610" style="s2">right there&#39;s a stability in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:02.930" style="s2">presence at least not lying and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.610" end="00:12:04.280" style="s2">hearing you talk about like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.930" end="00:12:06.740" style="s2">get you as a place where you there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.280" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">some kind of stability that some</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.740" end="00:12:12.410" style="s2">gathering or it&#39;s coming yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:14.090" style="s2">seem to have the knack for meeting</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.410" end="00:12:16.280" style="s2">interesting people that&#39;s for sure I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.090" end="00:12:19.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to be a student and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.280" end="00:12:21.890" style="s2">to have you know on some level right</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.220" end="00:12:23.780" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.890" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">that&#39;s missing in this culture is is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.780" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">that people people who you know people</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:34.220" style="s2">don&#39;t look for older people you know as</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">models models for them and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.220" end="00:12:40.700" style="s2">done that so I&#39;ve always I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:44.660" style="s2">almost met very powerful older older men</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">usually yeah uh-huh and and learned</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.660" end="00:12:51.620" style="s2">learned that way what happens in my own</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.310" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">family situation it was very let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.620" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">I spent most of my teenage taught tied</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:13:00.200" style="s2">with my with my mother right yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">know and I and I kind of experienced the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.200" end="00:13:04.400" style="s2">feminine world very very intensely as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:07.730" style="s2">younger person and I I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.400" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">relate to the masculinity and the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.730" end="00:13:13.340" style="s2">time I guess there was a search for for</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:15.110" style="s2">like cosmic father figure on some level</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.340" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.110" end="00:13:24.700" style="s2">oh yeah totally so that there&#39;s a sipper</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:27.649" style="s2">there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a way where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.700" end="00:13:32.360" style="s2">would have met for one as I late to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.649" end="00:13:35.180" style="s2">right I relate to that sense of what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.360" end="00:13:38.180" style="s2">personally had people that have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.180" end="00:13:42.100" style="s2">just really really deep and smart and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.180" end="00:13:45.709" style="s2">wise and multiple dimensions um</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.100" end="00:13:50.570" style="s2">throughout my life that take me under</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.709" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">their wing and and and in some way one</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.570" end="00:13:55.220" style="s2">of the things that they did is they</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:57.890" style="s2">taught me how to learn I think right</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.220" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">like the Emmy stories they relate to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.890" end="00:14:04.100" style="s2">in some way that would have some wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">right and I they they on one level I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.100" end="00:14:08.360" style="s2">learning everything that they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.540" end="00:14:14.779" style="s2">teaching me but at another level I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.360" end="00:14:18.589" style="s2">I was they were simultaneously teaching</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.779" end="00:14:21.410" style="s2">me how to be taught how to learn mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.589" end="00:14:23.930" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s got really deep in me</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.410" end="00:14:25.970" style="s2">made me think of you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.930" end="00:14:28.339" style="s2">Heidegger and I remember there&#39;s a quote</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.970" end="00:14:30.380" style="s2">Heidegger saying the bet that the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.339" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">teacher is the top learner like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.380" end="00:14:34.520" style="s2">learning all the time and people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.260" style="s2">just being lifted up with him yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.520" end="00:14:38.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not that he&#39;s teaching people he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.260" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">he&#39;s learning and then he&#39;s lifting up</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.450" end="00:14:42.410" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:44.510" style="s2">right totally yes exactly letting learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.410" end="00:14:47.329" style="s2">I think he&#39;s so so being around somebody</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.929" end="00:17:25.660" style="s2">we need that you brought up in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.220" end="00:17:28.179" style="s2">beginning of being a walker of</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.669" end="00:17:49.210" style="s2">situating ourselves right but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">situating is is a verb right it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.210" end="00:17:53.169" style="s2">think that we have to I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">like for baekje what he talks about is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.169" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">like you know on some level he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:18:02.650" style="s2">really it seems to me that a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:05.110" style="s2">work is he&#39;s really trying to put the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.650" end="00:18:07.419" style="s2">propositional in the rights not get rid</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.110" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">of the propositional right now get rid</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.419" end="00:18:16.120" style="s2">of the definite certainty but but reveal</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">reveal the knowing upon which those</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.120" end="00:18:22.570" style="s2">certainties arose out of so we can stand</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:24.520" style="s2">on them to to to dive deeper in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.570" end="00:18:26.890" style="s2">mystery in stick because he seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.520" end="00:18:28.450" style="s2">to me what it seems like is he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.890" end="00:18:31.000" style="s2">like look we got a look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.450" end="00:18:33.880" style="s2">emerging we have to look at the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.000" end="00:18:37.299" style="s2">and the intelligibility of the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.880" end="00:18:40.030" style="s2">right and not be blinded to it by our</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.299" end="00:18:41.409" style="s2">heed for certainty and all the all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.030" end="00:18:43.780" style="s2">stuff that goes underneath that so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.409" end="00:18:45.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a I would say that that there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.780" end="00:18:47.559" style="s2">a commonality of all the people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.700" end="00:18:51.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking to that have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.559" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">quality of being a walker of two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.460" end="00:19:01.960" style="s2">and and and and our so our home in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:05.620" style="s2">way is continually deepening a that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.960" end="00:19:07.450" style="s2">which situates right you know which</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.620" end="00:19:11.320" style="s2">seems to be more or less of a period and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.450" end="00:19:15.700" style="s2">more of a question mark right you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.320" end="00:19:17.559" style="s2">to restore the question and yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.700" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">know as as you were talking about I had</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">psychological terms there have become</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.860" end="00:22:14.010" style="s2">more about signaling a social in group</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:17.400" style="s2">of some kind of some kind like mmm like</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.130" end="00:22:40.200" style="s2">presuppose that all those things have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.810" end="00:22:42.210" style="s2">particular meaning yeah don&#39;t the Dunkel</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.200" end="00:22:44.160" style="s2">on being questioned and so what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.210" end="00:22:45.660" style="s2">thinking is not happening right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.160" end="00:22:47.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like what Heidegger would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.660" end="00:22:51.090" style="s2">thinking the thinking is not happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.610" end="00:22:57.270" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s kind of yeah it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.090" end="00:22:59.790" style="s2">of salon activity yes yes yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.270" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like that so you&#39;re you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.790" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">like the like that like the earth around</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:09.570" style="s2">it is I think it&#39;s intelligent I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s really really intelligent because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.570" end="00:23:13.590" style="s2">there&#39;s something else available you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.090" end="00:23:17.780" style="s2">know which i think is we&#39;re circling</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.590" end="00:23:20.490" style="s2">there the circling for me and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.780" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">historically like how it started at my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.490" end="00:23:26.490" style="s2">grappling with it in the in the in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">the trenches with the people like as we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.490" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">were discovering it it wasn&#39;t really the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:35.730" style="s2">essence of it wasn&#39;t about it had</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:38.730" style="s2">nothing to do with even personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.730" end="00:23:43.680" style="s2">the notion of personal growth it was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.730" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">about evoking a wonder right a in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.680" end="00:23:52.110" style="s2">phenomenological that there&#39;s an that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:54.330" style="s2">that there is at all right like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.110" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">this sense of I think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.330" end="00:24:00.779" style="s2">were all</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:24:02.909" style="s2">at the beach around the fire that as we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.779" end="00:24:05.190" style="s2">were circling what what were we doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.909" end="00:24:07.049" style="s2">when we were doing all of that like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.190" end="00:24:09.539" style="s2">irritable was is like well I kept</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.049" end="00:24:11.460" style="s2">feeling like that fire kept circling</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.539" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">around that fire together and like going</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.460" end="00:24:19.879" style="s2">through this and talking about our lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:22.529" style="s2">would lead to these the presence of life</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.879" end="00:24:24.749" style="s2">in the moment and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.529" end="00:24:26.759" style="s2">describe it and then realizing it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.749" end="00:24:28.859" style="s2">go away in the description but something</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.759" end="00:24:30.989" style="s2">would come come forward and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.859" end="00:24:34.039" style="s2">away and then bringing language to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.989" end="00:24:36.869" style="s2">and that sense of kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.039" end="00:24:43.109" style="s2">philosophical intimacy right that sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.869" end="00:24:46.019" style="s2">of Ray exoticness that constantly eludes</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.109" end="00:24:50.940" style="s2">you but yet constitutes you at the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.019" end="00:24:54.479" style="s2">time yeah so that to me that&#39;s the heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.940" end="00:24:56.809" style="s2">of circling right I think I can feel why</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.479" end="00:24:59.159" style="s2">you are so influenced by Heidegger right</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.809" end="00:25:00.389" style="s2">and in doing that when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.159" end="00:25:02.759" style="s2">about this this sort of getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.389" end="00:25:05.220" style="s2">underneath concepts right getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.759" end="00:25:07.259" style="s2">underneath everything and keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.220" end="00:25:10.349" style="s2">keeping it all dynamic and alive without</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.259" end="00:25:13.259" style="s2">getting fixed in some kind of way no</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.349" end="00:25:14.519" style="s2">keeping that like as I think everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.259" end="00:25:17.249" style="s2">in Heidegger should have moves towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.519" end="00:25:22.169" style="s2">poetry at some level but poor time</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.249" end="00:25:26.099" style="s2">between people absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.169" end="00:25:28.669" style="s2">totally yeah so that so on one level I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.099" end="00:25:28.669" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.889" end="00:25:32.919" style="s2">because then I really heard you when he</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.359" end="00:25:40.899" style="s2">said like keep everything alive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.919" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">it&#39;s more like keep noticing how how the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.899" end="00:25:48.309" style="s2">how I how I don&#39;t recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:50.499" style="s2">aliveness right it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.309" end="00:25:53.139" style="s2">like revealing that everything&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.499" end="00:25:58.809" style="s2">right it&#39;s like there&#39;s a that there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.139" end="00:26:03.149" style="s2">something alive and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.809" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">something about our time that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.149" end="00:26:11.979" style="s2">take that alive this and make it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:14.169" style="s2">extract it Montag arise make it you kill</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.979" end="00:26:16.329" style="s2">it make it dead dead you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.169" end="00:26:18.339" style="s2">walking around with it with corpses</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.329" end="00:26:21.099" style="s2">everywhere I mean yeah and we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.339" end="00:26:25.839" style="s2">know so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the zombie image</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.099" end="00:26:29.199" style="s2">right yeah so there&#39;s and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.839" end="00:26:32.859" style="s2">inside of ourselves where we slip into</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.199" end="00:26:36.729" style="s2">kind of a dull State yeah we&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.859" end="00:26:38.199" style="s2">alive as we could be yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.729" end="00:26:41.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons for that one</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.199" end="00:26:46.809" style="s2">reason is it&#39;s just that we&#39;re all so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.709" end="00:26:50.469" style="s2">hyper socially conscious and you know of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.809" end="00:26:53.319" style="s2">our role in our you know our job and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.469" end="00:26:56.499" style="s2">know how can we be ourselves how can we</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.319" end="00:27:02.139" style="s2">flourish as our you know well ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.499" end="00:27:04.209" style="s2">but how can we just you know yeah within</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.139" end="00:27:06.369" style="s2">the the actual work like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.209" end="00:27:08.649" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to make it sound like just</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.369" end="00:27:10.690" style="s2">being yourself being authentic is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.649" end="00:27:12.369" style="s2">point it&#39;s it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.690" end="00:27:14.859" style="s2">it&#39;s a discipline and a work as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.369" end="00:27:16.779" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to things and we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.859" end="00:27:21.249" style="s2">about this notion of authenticity right</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.779" end="00:27:23.559" style="s2">is yeah his is yeah if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.249" end="00:27:26.679" style="s2">it psychologically it usually means</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.559" end="00:27:30.690" style="s2">something like alright so thing inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.679" end="00:27:33.099" style="s2">you know he matches the thing outside</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.690" end="00:27:36.039" style="s2">inside matches outside I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.099" end="00:27:39.609" style="s2">authentic you know which is is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.039" end="00:27:42.310" style="s2">usually can can turn into like like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.609" end="00:27:45.010" style="s2">know I just keep revealing myself review</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.310" end="00:27:49.480" style="s2">myself revealing myself right however I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.010" end="00:27:53.350" style="s2">think that&#39;s a on to flop gray</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:54.940" style="s2">authenticity is something I think more</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.350" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">primordial than that I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.940" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">right I mean more like it you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:28:01.150" style="s2">it&#39;s right there&#39;s a discipline to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:05.920" style="s2">like when I think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.150" end="00:28:10.990" style="s2">authenticity like author right it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.920" end="00:28:12.940" style="s2">it&#39;s more like if you&#39;re well you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.990" end="00:28:15.610" style="s2">touch with the muse on some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.940" end="00:28:17.350" style="s2">not you yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.610" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">personality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.350" end="00:28:22.120" style="s2">why it&#39;s not even your it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:24.100" style="s2">your multiple you&#39;re not even your you</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.120" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">know Gert chef says or something man is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.100" end="00:28:27.700" style="s2">legion we have all these millions of sub</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">personnel is it&#39;s not even those voices</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.700" end="00:28:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s on link something coming from</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:35.500" style="s2">beyond right that multiplicity I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.040" end="00:28:40.120" style="s2">and yeah being being be having a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.500" end="00:28:43.750" style="s2">coherent tonality to it or yeah nato-led</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.120" end="00:28:48.040" style="s2">a Co hate Co here this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.750" end="00:28:50.610" style="s2">about about I think authenticity if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.040" end="00:28:54.100" style="s2">say authenticity is something like on</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.610" end="00:28:56.590" style="s2">concealment and in authenticity is it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.100" end="00:28:58.300" style="s2">something like concealment right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.590" end="00:29:02.590" style="s2">something about those two things right</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.300" end="00:29:05.050" style="s2">um so so like authenticity I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:08.500" style="s2">primarily has to do with a way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.050" end="00:29:11.980" style="s2">tending and listening to what is most</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.500" end="00:29:13.870" style="s2">primordial right and I think in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.980" end="00:29:17.020" style="s2">times it&#39;s like listening to that which</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.870" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">is most near right that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.020" end="00:29:24.220" style="s2">horizon that that I&#39;m seeing with that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.480" end="00:29:26.260" style="s2">don&#39;t see right that and so on some</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.220" end="00:29:29.560" style="s2">level yeah I think I&#39;m some level in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.260" end="00:29:33.310" style="s2">acting authenticity is more like not</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.560" end="00:29:35.800" style="s2">just like if I wanna so I want to like</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.310" end="00:29:38.980" style="s2">if I want to like if I have to bathe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.800" end="00:29:41.170" style="s2">public public or like right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.980" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">famous Greek philosopher I forget yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.170" end="00:29:46.060" style="s2">totally that&#39;s craziness you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:51.850" style="s2">it but I think it&#39;s more like taking up</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.060" end="00:29:54.100" style="s2">a role in the culture right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.850" end="00:29:57.370" style="s2">and not just doing what I want but</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.100" end="00:29:59.559" style="s2">really taking it on is like similar to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.370" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">reading a text right it&#39;s like reading</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.559" end="00:30:05.289" style="s2">the text so deeply right so like reading</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">all of it right so we&#39;ve kind of tried</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.289" end="00:30:10.809" style="s2">to read it like where the word if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">where you&#39;re waking up the dead author</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.809" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">because you feel you feel so right to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:20.169" style="s2">the point where you read it so fully but</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:22.919" style="s2">at some point you turn the next chapter</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.169" end="00:30:27.270" style="s2">and do you find yourself writing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.919" end="00:30:30.730" style="s2">right in that sense of that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.270" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">authorship is well you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.730" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why I said about being a student</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:36.850" style="s2">right that&#39;s probably the beginning part</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:38.169" style="s2">when you&#39;re reading the book and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.850" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">keep reading the book and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.169" end="00:30:43.990" style="s2">reading the book and keep it and all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:45.669" style="s2">different you know nuances and shades</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.990" end="00:30:47.590" style="s2">and colors of the book kinda you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.669" end="00:30:49.659" style="s2">and until you&#39;re actually yeah you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.590" end="00:30:51.970" style="s2">you are you&#39;re writing the book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.659" end="00:30:53.650" style="s2">yeah absolutely you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.970" end="00:30:55.929" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re the one writing the book</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.650" end="00:30:59.080" style="s2">absolutely the book of your life or</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.929" end="00:31:01.240" style="s2">whatever yes yes and so I think you like</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.080" end="00:31:03.010" style="s2">it for example in in the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.240" end="00:31:05.020" style="s2">circling and so one thing I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.010" end="00:31:07.659" style="s2">say it&#39;s like I there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.020" end="00:31:09.250" style="s2">definitely circling there&#39;s circling and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.659" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">then there&#39;s guys saying stalks and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.250" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:16.120" style="s2">right in fact I think if anything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:17.860" style="s2">always I&#39;m always the one at the edges</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.120" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">of everything kind of listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.860" end="00:31:21.610" style="s2">whistle istening to circling and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:23.890" style="s2">listening to what what&#39;s beyond it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.610" end="00:31:29.169" style="s2">what&#39;s under it right so I I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.890" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">more disruptive to circling then I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.169" end="00:31:34.809" style="s2">it&#39;s always just been my proclivity the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:37.240" style="s2">but I think one of the things that when</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.809" end="00:31:40.090" style="s2">you learn how to circle right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.240" end="00:31:42.970" style="s2">much that listening that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:46.210" style="s2">thing you&#39;re practicing it&#39;s the booby</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.970" end="00:31:49.090" style="s2">prize is connection right the booby</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.210" end="00:31:50.950" style="s2">prize is intimacy right yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.090" end="00:31:53.289" style="s2">like it&#39;s like what it takes to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.950" end="00:31:55.900" style="s2">intimate or all of these deep things</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.289" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">right and you because if you just think</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.900" end="00:32:01.540" style="s2">about it if you&#39;re I mean if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:05.650" style="s2">get closer to the cosmos right if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.540" end="00:32:08.980" style="s2">wanna if you want to really know</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.650" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">about reality no you might as well look</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.980" end="00:32:15.550" style="s2">in the most complex part of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:19.630" style="s2">right which it seems to be the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.550" end="00:32:21.730" style="s2">face and probably talk they probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.630" end="00:32:25.540" style="s2">want to look at the part of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.730" end="00:32:26.710" style="s2">that can actually talk well I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.540" end="00:32:28.600" style="s2">thinking about when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.710" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">about intimacy I was thinking about my</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.600" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">wife and I and our intimacy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:36.040" style="s2">something that you can&#39;t really define</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:39.160" style="s2">and in any kind of way and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.040" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">very different than what you would</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.160" end="00:32:42.460" style="s2">imagine it would be right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.190" style="s2">different like if you&#39;re a young person</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.460" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re looking for a partner or</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.190" end="00:32:48.490" style="s2">something and you&#39;re you you have all</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.400" style="s2">these needs and you want this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.490" end="00:32:53.740" style="s2">person and and and then you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.400" end="00:32:54.820" style="s2">know you meet this kind of person and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.740" end="00:32:55.930" style="s2">then you meet another printer that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.820" end="00:33:01.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out and you meet another</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.930" end="00:33:02.980" style="s2">person and you kind of and then then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.300" end="00:33:04.750" style="s2">discover intimacy yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.980" end="00:33:07.090" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s completely different right</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.750" end="00:33:09.610" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.090" end="00:33:11.140" style="s2">whatever it is you were desire ignore</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.610" end="00:33:13.390" style="s2">whatever it is you wanted that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.140" end="00:33:15.880" style="s2">thought would fulfill you in its in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.390" end="00:33:20.620" style="s2">kind of a way it&#39;s it&#39;s something far</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.880" end="00:33:23.320" style="s2">deeper and and I don&#39;t want you to - hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.620" end="00:33:26.620" style="s2">it&#39;s almost so wantable what its</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.320" end="00:33:30.460" style="s2">unwanted oh yeah it&#39;s like because to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.620" end="00:33:33.910" style="s2">get it to experience intimacy is to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.460" end="00:33:38.110" style="s2">transformed by it so it&#39;s like if I say</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.910" end="00:33:39.640" style="s2">want intimacy yeah it&#39;s almost gross or</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.110" end="00:33:43.090" style="s2">something isn&#39;t it it&#39;s almost like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.640" end="00:33:46.840" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re imposing on on</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.090" end="00:33:50.770" style="s2">on Hunt&#39;s on something yeah that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.840" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s already there or yeah already</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.770" end="00:33:54.850" style="s2">the case like I would wear like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:57.550" style="s2">like it&#39;s just yeah that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.850" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">something primordial we primordial II</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.550" end="00:34:07.330" style="s2">revealing about being our being my</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:11.470" style="s2">existing and that&#39;s the comes in in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.330" end="00:34:13.540" style="s2">through the intimacy it&#39;s it&#39;s and and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.470" end="00:34:16.390" style="s2">think Jay people genuinely want intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.540" end="00:34:19.659" style="s2">right but but there is phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.390" end="00:34:21.819" style="s2">quality of that when you actually get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.659" end="00:34:24.220" style="s2">there&#39;s this experience of like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.819" end="00:34:26.819" style="s2">god this is there&#39;s no way I could like</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.220" end="00:34:30.279" style="s2">whatever I was thinking about it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.819" end="00:34:32.379" style="s2">fright it is way more than I could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.279" end="00:34:35.529" style="s2">ever even have wanted or known to watch</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.379" end="00:34:41.619" style="s2">and in order and through having it I am</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.529" end="00:34:43.960" style="s2">now somebody that can I&#39;m now somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.619" end="00:34:46.210" style="s2">different right that can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.960" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">it and that&#39;s the thing about intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.210" end="00:34:55.029" style="s2">it&#39;s like it is very very man it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it creates it generate constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.029" end="00:35:00.039" style="s2">ourselves right like those moments if</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.569" style="s2">you think about I really appreciated the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.039" end="00:35:03.460" style="s2">way that you talked about that like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.569" end="00:35:06.069" style="s2">yeah if I think about like what I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.460" end="00:35:08.859" style="s2">doing talking to my friends over here</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.069" end="00:35:10.599" style="s2">maybe dating over here and then I had</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.859" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">this intimacy with my wife and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.599" end="00:35:18.309" style="s2">completely different universe yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:21.640" style="s2">heard you say oh I was thinking about we</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.309" end="00:35:26.529" style="s2">the product we tend to be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.640" end="00:35:29.589" style="s2">the product and and it&#39;s not just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.529" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">not the process that that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.589" end="00:35:38.710" style="s2">for the intimacy but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">just it&#39;s just the living texture of mmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.710" end="00:35:42.940" style="s2">how would you describe actually what</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:46.950" style="s2">when he when you look at that contrast</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.940" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">right as you said how would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.950" end="00:35:57.279" style="s2">the experience of yourself it with with</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:59.349" style="s2">your partner that is surprising what is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.279" end="00:36:02.380" style="s2">the phenomenology of it like what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.349" end="00:36:11.470" style="s2">it look like feel like how has it</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.380" end="00:36:15.130" style="s2">transformed you if it has what is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.470" end="00:36:17.980" style="s2">tone us and as you recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.130" end="00:36:21.819" style="s2">well it&#39;s love but love us it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.980" end="00:36:23.380" style="s2">it&#39;s such an abused word right so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.819" end="00:36:27.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.380" end="00:36:30.329" style="s2">even though that&#39;s what it is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.880" end="00:36:30.329" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.380" end="00:36:36.490" style="s2">again although all of these words are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.820" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">just are just words right so I the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.490" end="00:36:43.630" style="s2">word that came to me is divinity or</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">divine or you know I was listening a jar</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.630" end="00:36:49.840" style="s2">of aching he was saying you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">was wanted to talk about the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.840" end="00:36:55.810" style="s2">uh-huh and I would say no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:57.550" style="s2">sacred it&#39;s divine and in other words</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.810" end="00:36:59.950" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just completely divine</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.550" end="00:37:03.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not sacred sacred is something a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.950" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">little bit outside right it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.400" end="00:37:08.440" style="s2">that you bow down to are you you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it has an aspirational quality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.440" end="00:37:13.620" style="s2">but it but but intimacy in its ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">sense is fully divine isn&#39;t it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.620" end="00:37:19.150" style="s2">yeah well what I think what I am</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.690" end="00:37:26.110" style="s2">imagining when I hear the word divine I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.150" end="00:37:28.900" style="s2">get the sense of something behind what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.490" end="00:37:52.270" style="s2">the main the between is is is is is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.210" end="00:37:55.960" style="s2">is larger and deeper than the two</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.270" end="00:37:59.110" style="s2">separate beings who are yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.960" end="00:38:00.730" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re up to yeah why would</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.110" end="00:38:02.530" style="s2">imagine it&#39;s kind of like I just what</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.530" end="00:38:07.240" style="s2">the so here&#39;s the dialogue oh right like</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.680" end="00:38:09.250" style="s2">like it&#39;s just like it&#39;s just like all</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.240" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">of a sudden I&#39;m starting to something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.250" end="00:38:14.530" style="s2">coming to me that I wasn&#39;t a whip I</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:16.150" style="s2">wasn&#39;t thinking about it like that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.530" end="00:38:19.230" style="s2">some you know you can kind of fit I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.150" end="00:38:21.460" style="s2">could kind of feel the like there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.230" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.460" end="00:38:27.840" style="s2">like and then mmm kind of it going up</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:29.800" style="s2">leading to the slick sense of going ah</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.840" end="00:38:31.630" style="s2">something&#39;s transcending because now</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.800" end="00:38:33.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve never quite thought of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.630" end="00:38:36.700" style="s2">or the difference between the two in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.910" end="00:38:41.530" style="s2">this way but I think that you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.700" end="00:38:43.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like there is this sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.530" end="00:38:46.970" style="s2">I&#39;m experiencing in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.340" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">this intimacy with my wife does have</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.970" end="00:38:54.350" style="s2">this constant experience of recognizing</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.350" end="00:38:58.610" style="s2">wanted this like I couldn&#39;t do I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.660" end="00:39:00.260" style="s2">definitely couldn&#39;t have earned it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.610" end="00:39:03.110" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t have even tried to earn it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.260" end="00:39:07.070" style="s2">because whatever it is is so present and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.110" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">breaks through that&#39;s so beyond what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.070" end="00:39:11.150" style="s2">did or it didn&#39;t do or all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">stuff</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:14.950" style="s2">something about um that things are upped</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.790" end="00:41:19.329" style="s2">in the space between us right like</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.950" end="00:41:21.819" style="s2">things like that it seems so in</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.329" end="00:41:24.220" style="s2">something grabbing that there something</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.819" end="00:41:26.260" style="s2">about the the conversation seems you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.220" end="00:41:29.410" style="s2">evoke those things and you&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.260" end="00:41:32.950" style="s2">yourself they become really salient yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.410" end="00:41:40.290" style="s2">exactly yeah yeah and the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.950" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">stuff seems back rounded yeah yeah no no</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:47.859" style="s2">like my only intention was I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.210" end="00:41:52.210" style="s2">I&#39;d like listen to podcasts and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.859" end="00:41:55.500" style="s2">like that I would go like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.210" end="00:41:57.970" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more possible in these</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.500" end="00:42:00.010" style="s2">conversations with these people I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.970" end="00:42:01.630" style="s2">Jesus like it was so much like so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.010" end="00:42:03.220" style="s2">things that were missed and they were</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.630" end="00:42:05.950" style="s2">giant kind of driving me nuts and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.220" end="00:42:07.630" style="s2">thought it was like somebody said guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.950" end="00:42:09.730" style="s2">you ought to do a podcast you&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.630" end="00:42:11.079" style="s2">good interviewer that&#39;s like okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.730" end="00:42:14.230" style="s2">started thinking about it and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.079" end="00:42:18.760" style="s2">okay well maybe I can justify doing it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.230" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">out maybe this is a good way to to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.760" end="00:42:24.700" style="s2">to kind of get the word out so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.690" end="00:42:26.440" style="s2">and I was thinking like it&#39;d be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.700" end="00:42:29.800" style="s2">interesting just to try to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.440" end="00:42:31.630" style="s2">conversation where it was like it was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.800" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">sweet spot between like you could say</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.630" end="00:42:36.700" style="s2">like a normal conversation or interview</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:39.819" style="s2">and and something like circling like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.700" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">what would be the sign not to beard</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.819" end="00:42:44.740" style="s2">where people are like what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">that right and it&#39;s so it&#39;s really kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:49.569" style="s2">of hits that sweet spot and yeah well I</p>

<p begin="00:43:01.780" end="00:43:07.829" style="s2">marketing to to infect a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.560" end="00:43:11.560" style="s2">with somebody</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.220" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">music at the beginning of the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.720" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">but I make it very short and III don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:31.300" style="s2">need production I don&#39;t need any of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.510" style="s2">these things I guess I get a bench</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.300" end="00:43:36.819" style="s2">eventually perhaps if if this takes off</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.510" end="00:43:40.089" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll have to think more about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.819" end="00:43:43.510" style="s2">those things but the raw the raw stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.089" end="00:43:45.670" style="s2">is always more interesting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.510" end="00:43:48.130" style="s2">like if we think about the raw stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.670" end="00:43:50.859" style="s2">you&#39;re making a distinction between like</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.130" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">like oh yeah I don&#39;t want to do this one</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.859" end="00:43:53.770" style="s2">thing yeah and I do want to do this</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.810" end="00:44:04.990" style="s2">what it is but this marketing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.880" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">imagining is something like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.990" end="00:44:11.349" style="s2">to I don&#39;t want to like frame and and</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:19.930" style="s2">the question comes up for me and that is</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.930" end="00:44:27.700" style="s2">allegiance to or that maybe it was the</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.930" end="00:45:19.830" style="s2">certain situations that in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.180" end="00:45:21.780" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.830" end="00:45:23.490" style="s2">but it&#39;s in other ways it&#39;s an advantage</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.840" end="00:47:26.340" style="s2">practicing circling for like the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.750" end="00:47:29.170" style="s2">years if I think about like them the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.340" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">machinery it exercises mm-hmm</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.299" end="00:47:42.130" style="s2">and what listening is is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.180" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">than just in quiet and paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:51.990" style="s2">right it&#39;s it doing that over and over</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">and over again I feel like I feel more</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.990" end="00:48:00.490" style="s2">oriented to I think the revealing of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:02.530" style="s2">that which I continually find myself an</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.490" end="00:48:05.829" style="s2">allegiance in which is something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.530" end="00:48:08.619" style="s2">that more ness or the like that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.829" end="00:48:12.490" style="s2">the inexhaustible intelligibility that</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.410" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">want to get you at the deepest level I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.569" end="00:48:36.220" style="s2">want to understand why you exist in how</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:39.460" style="s2">you exist and and those things have you</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.460" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">right here right now but they</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.839" end="00:48:49.170" style="s2">simultaneously like have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:52.990" style="s2">deep primordial transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.170" end="00:48:54.760" style="s2">contextual disclosures of the holes</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.990" end="00:48:56.290" style="s2">right that I mean that&#39;s what a human</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.760" end="00:48:59.799" style="s2">being is in the moment what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.290" end="00:49:03.430" style="s2">else is it but like an awkward thing</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.430" end="00:49:08.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s the human face that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.280" end="00:49:10.030" style="s2">probably why when somebody walks into a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.170" end="00:49:13.950" style="s2">room we&#39;re like it changes the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.030" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">moment right like if mm-hmm like it or</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.950" end="00:49:21.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say afterwards you know that</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.240" end="00:49:26.049" style="s2">after this podcast this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.710" end="00:49:28.420" style="s2">completely different moment right go</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.049" end="00:49:30.280" style="s2">shooting what do you mean like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.420" end="00:49:32.470" style="s2">like yeah he&#39;s like somebody are you</p>

<p begin="00:49:37.020" end="00:49:42.619" style="s2">play in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.859" end="00:49:46.579" style="s2">some way what&#39;s constituting this moment</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.619" end="00:49:50.089" style="s2">are these are these these this</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.579" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">recognition of one time right temper</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.089" end="00:49:55.009" style="s2">ality but also this sense of like when</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:57.109" style="s2">were when we&#39;re in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.009" end="00:50:00.739" style="s2">another human being it&#39;s not just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.109" end="00:50:03.470" style="s2">another object it&#39;s a completely it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.739" end="00:50:06.710" style="s2">changes the texture of the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.470" end="00:50:09.609" style="s2">the moment right if you know them if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.710" end="00:50:13.130" style="s2">don&#39;t know them it&#39;s okay it&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.609" end="00:50:15.349" style="s2">so so you&#39;re looking at pure meaning</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.130" end="00:50:17.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at another human</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.349" end="00:50:20.119" style="s2">being and if then if you look at what</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.420" end="00:50:22.460" style="s2">what is meaning so it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.119" end="00:50:24.680" style="s2">is one of the things like when I really</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.460" end="00:50:26.509" style="s2">got this when I was in art school I</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.680" end="00:50:27.799" style="s2">can&#39;t I moved to San Francisco to go to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.509" end="00:50:31.099" style="s2">go to the San Francisco Art Institute</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.799" end="00:50:33.380" style="s2">the sculptor in a painter yeah yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.099" end="00:50:35.059" style="s2">had this like I had this life this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.380" end="00:50:37.460" style="s2">amazing teacher this life drawing</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.059" end="00:50:40.069" style="s2">teacher right where we would you know we</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.460" end="00:50:41.749" style="s2">would like constantly draw you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.069" end="00:50:43.190" style="s2">they&#39;d have like nude models and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.749" end="00:50:46.309" style="s2">like that so we were constantly drawing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.190" end="00:50:49.339" style="s2">nude models and and to hear him talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.309" end="00:50:51.380" style="s2">about it&#39;s really fun when he would do</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.339" end="00:50:55.999" style="s2">his critiques because to hear him talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.380" end="00:50:58.789" style="s2">about like what it was to render a human</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.999" end="00:51:03.069" style="s2">being he&#39;s he would say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.789" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">it&#39;s weird you can get away with like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.069" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">like drawing an animal you know in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:13.910" style="s2">that you can&#39;t get away with in drawing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.869" style="s2">the human being and he says because</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.910" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">every single part of the human being is</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.869" end="00:51:23.269" style="s2">dynamic and expressive and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:27.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to understand that is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.269" end="00:51:30.589" style="s2">there&#39;s not one inch of the figure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.220" end="00:51:33.009" style="s2">doesn&#39;t communicate a world mmm right</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.589" end="00:51:37.069" style="s2">there&#39;s not one part of it that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.009" end="00:51:39.559" style="s2">express right a whole culture a whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.069" end="00:51:45.609" style="s2">world a whole lifetime a whole future</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.559" end="00:51:47.809" style="s2">ever so if you if you render it either</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.609" end="00:51:49.940" style="s2">realistically or abstractly in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.809" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">that like if any part of it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.940" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">speak or say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:57.609" style="s2">somehow doesn&#39;t really show its humanity</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:51:59.010" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t show its figurative this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.609" end="00:52:02.530" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.010" end="00:52:04.990" style="s2">and I just I wonder that maybe think of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.530" end="00:52:07.660" style="s2">is that when you tried to create the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.990" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">whole of a person if you are sketching</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.660" end="00:52:14.740" style="s2">them or drawing them you could only do</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:16.420" style="s2">that if it was incomplete like the human</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.740" end="00:52:18.069" style="s2">being is incomplete right whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.420" end="00:52:20.290" style="s2">animal would be complete already right</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.069" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">there as if you&#39;re drawing a human being</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.650" end="01:02:10.570" style="s2">especially now because people don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.450" end="01:02:11.830" style="s2">about poetry you know and most poetry</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.570" end="01:02:14.500" style="s2">has just swallowed up by it</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.830" end="01:02:20.320" style="s2">by the Machine right right by that by</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.500" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">the endless discussions and yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.320" end="01:02:26.410" style="s2">a way where he just dwells there like</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:31.030" style="s2">the way man the way that language loves</p>

<p begin="01:02:39.970" end="01:02:47.770" style="s2">match that somehow comes out like you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.720" end="01:02:49.180" style="s2">get the woven tapestry of a wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.770" end="01:02:51.340" style="s2">match of just something like where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.180" end="01:02:54.070" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s fuck it&#39;s like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.340" end="01:02:56.859" style="s2">bucks of intelligibility and he weaves</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.070" end="01:02:59.560" style="s2">these two things of like the deft hand</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.859" end="01:03:01.750" style="s2">and right that which be holds is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.560" end="01:03:04.090" style="s2">which was beholden and he just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.750" end="01:03:05.619" style="s2">this world coming on and there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.090" end="01:03:07.960" style="s2">which I currently get with them there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.619" end="01:03:10.990" style="s2">a ton there&#39;s it and he&#39;s so young at</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.960" end="01:03:12.670" style="s2">the same time which is so odd yeah odd</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.990" end="01:03:19.380" style="s2">to talk to somebody who&#39;s thirty years</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.670" end="01:03:22.359" style="s2">old who has that kind of ability to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.380" end="01:03:25.510" style="s2">speak I guess just speak words you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.359" end="01:03:28.260" style="s2">in that feelings you did you notice that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.510" end="01:03:30.910" style="s2">feel like for me it&#39;s like I there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.260" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like in a way that when as</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.910" end="01:03:35.980" style="s2">we&#39;re talking with it up talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:38.470" style="s2">Chris there&#39;s a way in which I feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.980" end="01:03:44.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve just evoke to spirit of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.470" end="01:03:46.450" style="s2">I feel like a context in his in a in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.050" end="01:03:50.890" style="s2">room of some kind or a different space</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.450" end="01:03:52.910" style="s2">and just a bulking his name and I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.890" end="01:03:56.509" style="s2">say that like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.910" end="01:04:00.979" style="s2">but I think what I feel it evoked by</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.509" end="01:04:02.599" style="s2">right and invoked into it is I would</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.979" end="01:04:05.420" style="s2">imagine would be something like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.599" end="01:04:08.029" style="s2">whatever it is that calls Chris into</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.420" end="01:04:09.619" style="s2">being like I&#39;m wondering about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.029" end="01:04:11.150" style="s2">another thing about the text I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.619" end="01:04:14.509" style="s2">trying to get this notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.150" end="01:04:16.130" style="s2">double right yeah like one of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.509" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">questions was what is your divine double</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.130" end="01:04:20.539" style="s2">aspect man it just seems like whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:22.700" style="s2">if I could answer that question it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.539" end="01:04:26.630" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t it probably isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.700" end="01:04:29.390" style="s2">there&#39;s this this mmm the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.630" end="01:04:31.069" style="s2">beyond the horizon right I thought of</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.390" end="01:04:34.220" style="s2">the quote by Rilke you know he says</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.069" end="01:04:36.170" style="s2">every angel is terrifying yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.220" end="01:04:36.619" style="s2">that&#39;s not a divine double and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.170" end="01:04:39.349" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.619" end="01:04:41.690" style="s2">yes which can&#39;t be defined and it also</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.349" end="01:04:45.190" style="s2">destroys us in that in some sense and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.690" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">does a currently disdains to annihilate</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.190" end="01:04:53.180" style="s2">various trains to annihilate us</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:54.829" style="s2">exactly yeah oka is pretty so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.180" end="01:04:57.440" style="s2">like there&#39;s something about I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.829" end="01:04:59.569" style="s2">this is this is part of the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.440" end="01:05:00.979" style="s2">Chris is what are you folks and me and</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.569" end="01:05:05.749" style="s2">it sounds like very something very</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.979" end="01:05:07.729" style="s2">similar for you is is he he evokes</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.749" end="01:05:09.950" style="s2">whatever it is that calls him to</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.729" end="01:05:12.200" style="s2">language it&#39;s like it but it goes beyond</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.950" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">Chris right there&#39;s this quality of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.200" end="01:05:19.099" style="s2">there is something really transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:23.239" style="s2">in just a voguing his name he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.099" end="01:05:27.430" style="s2">transparent to something mm-hmm that his</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.239" end="01:05:29.989" style="s2">language calls in and comes from mom I</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.430" end="01:05:32.420" style="s2">so I just end up really just like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.989" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">really like him I just really like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.420" end="01:05:38.359" style="s2">guy a lot he&#39;s such a such a well I</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:41.509" style="s2">guess that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.359" end="01:05:46.579" style="s2">those likable is is allowing yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.509" end="01:05:49.190" style="s2">be open to that transparency yeah which</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.579" end="01:05:51.170" style="s2">makes somebody it makes you feel like</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.190" end="01:05:56.390" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to somebody who&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.170" end="01:05:58.309" style="s2">persona who&#39;s not a mask who&#39;s not a it</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.390" end="01:06:01.460" style="s2">was not mechanical in this his way of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.309" end="01:06:05.259" style="s2">being somebody who&#39;s like he was like I</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.460" end="01:06:05.259" style="s2">guess opened up to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.300" end="01:06:15.040" style="s2">Oh on some level yeah me almost and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.340" end="01:06:17.570" style="s2">think to share in the way that he does I</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.040" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">think one of the things maybe that gets</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.570" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">communicated for me in that sharing is</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.980" end="01:06:29.060" style="s2">there something Trent yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.270" end="01:06:33.470" style="s2">quality when he speaks so lyrically and</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.060" end="01:06:36.680" style="s2">poetically and espouses in this way and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.470" end="01:06:38.900" style="s2">how it is like rolls off of him that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.680" end="01:06:41.510" style="s2">there is there is a way in which he</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.900" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">because he talks about Simba symbolism a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.510" end="01:06:47.540" style="s2">lot about even the way the Tillich does</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:50.450" style="s2">um where a symbol is transparent you</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.540" end="01:06:52.400" style="s2">look through a simple right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.450" end="01:06:55.340" style="s2">the symbols like speaks to what&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.400" end="01:06:59.690" style="s2">itself in some ways embodies it but</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.340" end="01:07:02.780" style="s2">beyond it so you actually live a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.690" end="01:07:06.590" style="s2">to you an act to simple right and as</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.780" end="01:07:09.290" style="s2">well as complex it&#39;s not opaque and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.590" end="01:07:12.560" style="s2">when you imagine like like Chris is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.290" end="01:07:15.080" style="s2">speaking symbology right but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.560" end="01:07:17.060" style="s2">pointing to whatever symbol it is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.080" end="01:07:20.440" style="s2">would speak symbology at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.060" end="01:07:25.310" style="s2">and there&#39;s this reverent saying that</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.440" end="01:07:27.110" style="s2">that is fills fills you up and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.310" end="01:07:30.760" style="s2">noticed that with Kristen with people</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.110" end="01:07:34.250" style="s2">like Chris mhm that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.760" end="01:07:37.460" style="s2">evocative yeah he&#39;s evocative that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:11:30.950" end="01:11:35.540" style="s2">revoking I like a voguing Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.780" end="01:11:37.160" style="s2">right the and the Greeks and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.540" end="01:11:39.700" style="s2">pre-socratics right which is this kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.160" end="01:11:44.600" style="s2">of notion the original notion of truth</p>

<p begin="01:12:00.140" end="01:12:05.390" style="s2">that lay Thea was a river or sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.230" end="01:12:08.600" style="s2">it&#39;s also portrayed as a lake in Queen</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.390" end="01:12:10.730" style="s2">pathology right in the river or lake of</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.600" end="01:12:12.020" style="s2">forgetfulness which is really</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.730" end="01:12:14.900" style="s2">interesting when you think about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.020" end="01:12:17.390" style="s2">because I realized I didn&#39;t really quite</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.920" end="01:14:36.619" style="s2">sort of endless process yes and I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.610" end="01:14:38.749" style="s2">what unfolds</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.619" end="01:14:43.129" style="s2">because of what I think that what what</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.749" end="01:14:46.579" style="s2">Heidegger was was reeling was</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.129" end="01:14:48.949" style="s2">remembering in going back and in into</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.579" end="01:14:51.379" style="s2">the the notion of truth in ilithyia I</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.949" end="01:14:54.139" style="s2">think what he was pointing out was</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.379" end="01:14:55.969" style="s2">something that that got lost and I which</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.139" end="01:14:57.949" style="s2">is what Heidegger I think kind of does</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.969" end="01:15:01.699" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s so cool about reading</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.949" end="01:15:04.129" style="s2">him is that you walk back into these</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.699" end="01:15:06.199" style="s2">places and it&#39;s a complete to do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.129" end="01:15:07.879" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.199" end="01:15:10.459" style="s2">hell he&#39;s talking about just the attempt</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.879" end="01:15:15.800" style="s2">to as you do these acrobats that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.459" end="01:15:18.769" style="s2">just like my to be deep deeply evoking</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.800" end="01:15:22.369" style="s2">and transformative almost you know and</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.769" end="01:15:24.649" style="s2">Alethea I started to realize that I</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.369" end="01:15:25.249" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s it&#39;s about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.649" end="01:15:27.499" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.249" end="01:15:30.709" style="s2">I think what&#39;s actually the real thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.499" end="01:15:34.399" style="s2">that got unconcealed is concealment</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.709" end="01:15:38.780" style="s2">itself is the is the revelation of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.399" end="01:15:42.079" style="s2">being right for being to be disclosed is</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.780" end="01:15:45.709" style="s2">it is it reveals that it was disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.079" end="01:15:48.079" style="s2">that its nature is concealment that when</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.709" end="01:15:52.159" style="s2">it reveals itself what it reveals is</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.079" end="01:15:54.349" style="s2">that there is concealment and that being</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.159" end="01:16:01.010" style="s2">is that thing which you can never become</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.349" end="01:16:03.709" style="s2">completely CLE clear about the vision</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.010" end="01:16:07.849" style="s2">itself health quality maybe being is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.709" end="01:16:13.129" style="s2">last concealment yeah yes and like in</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.849" end="01:16:15.349" style="s2">revealing it right it it reveals and in</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.129" end="01:16:17.719" style="s2">a certain sense conceals its revealing</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.349" end="01:16:21.320" style="s2">right kind of like light like light</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.719" end="01:16:25.699" style="s2">lights up everything but yet it it</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.320" end="01:16:28.699" style="s2">withdrawals in its disclosure right so</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.699" end="01:16:31.489" style="s2">it&#39;s like and win it withdrawals it does</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.699" end="01:16:34.489" style="s2">something but animates everything that</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.489" end="01:16:37.039" style="s2">we are and the thing about it so so like</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.489" end="01:16:38.689" style="s2">like a good example of this would be see</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.039" end="01:16:42.340" style="s2">it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like you like these are</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.689" end="01:16:42.340" style="s2">the things that I I II</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.350" end="01:16:45.890" style="s2">this is kind of very ilithyia Nazz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.420" end="01:16:47.510" style="s2">talking about it because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.890" end="01:16:50.240" style="s2">talking I&#39;ve been grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.510" end="01:16:51.710" style="s2">ilithyia my whole life but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.240" end="01:16:53.560" style="s2">this experience of like because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.710" end="01:16:56.150" style="s2">because it&#39;s a genuine idea isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.560" end="01:16:58.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a genuine idea because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.150" end="01:17:01.910" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to what it can reveal</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.190" end="01:17:03.680" style="s2">about itself yeah exactly so just sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.910" end="01:17:07.580" style="s2">of get close to it it&#39;s like it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.680" end="01:17:09.170" style="s2">intimate like I&#39;m like I I&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.580" end="01:17:11.930" style="s2">said this over and over again but what</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.170" end="01:17:13.730" style="s2">has me say it is that I feel like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.930" end="01:17:16.070" style="s2">more the closer I get to it the more</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.730" end="01:17:22.280" style="s2">withdrawals and reveals at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.070" end="01:17:24.950" style="s2">it&#39;s very much pregnant with what it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.280" end="01:17:27.950" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting I think the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.950" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">movie that exemplifies this is is the is</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.950" end="01:17:32.780" style="s2">the movie The Sixth Sense remember that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:35.390" style="s2">movie with Bruce Willis yeah it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.780" end="01:17:37.250" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t he was dead yeah I see what</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.390" end="01:17:39.800" style="s2">you mean yeah yeah he was dead the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.250" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">time right and and so you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.800" end="01:17:44.570" style="s2">the movie and he&#39;s dead and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:46.310" style="s2">know it right and in none of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.570" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">audience knows it either so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.310" end="01:17:50.270" style="s2">like it&#39;s all kind of weird something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:51.620" style="s2">kind of strange or something there</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.270" end="01:17:53.840" style="s2">anything in the movie I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.620" end="01:17:56.480" style="s2">exactly what happens but somehow like</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.840" end="01:18:00.890" style="s2">out of the corner of his eye he kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.480" end="01:18:04.100" style="s2">starts to get and then as he gets the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.890" end="01:18:07.370" style="s2">whole audience gets there&#39;s this moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.100" end="01:18:11.660" style="s2">of Alethea it starts to become revealed</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.370" end="01:18:13.490" style="s2">he&#39;s dead and like and as it&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.660" end="01:18:15.590" style="s2">you can kind of feel it go through the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.490" end="01:18:18.140" style="s2">movie theater right this revelation he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.590" end="01:18:22.790" style="s2">like oh my god I&#39;m dead</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.140" end="01:18:25.610" style="s2">and then like a moment later once that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.790" end="01:18:27.320" style="s2">recognition the revealing comes in then</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.610" end="01:18:30.050" style="s2">it goes back to the very beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.320" end="01:18:32.210" style="s2">the movie and if it flashes these like</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.050" end="01:18:36.500" style="s2">the main frames of everything that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.210" end="01:18:38.930" style="s2">just had watched and you can you can you</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.500" end="01:18:42.860" style="s2">see that it was obvious the whole time</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.930" end="01:18:45.860" style="s2">yeah right hmm there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.860" end="01:18:50.870" style="s2">that like that revelation of concealment</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.860" end="01:18:54.210" style="s2">in it&#39;s obvious in its nearness right so</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.870" end="01:18:56.850" style="s2">I think I think one of the good faith</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.210" end="01:18:59.040" style="s2">like wonder what are we what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.850" end="01:19:02.040" style="s2">what draws on this good faith in these</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.040" end="01:19:05.520" style="s2">conversations right is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.040" end="01:19:09.420" style="s2">desert that we&#39;re all oriented towards</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.520" end="01:19:12.450" style="s2">truth but in this Alethea sense that</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.420" end="01:19:17.610" style="s2">that that that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.450" end="01:19:21.090" style="s2">implicit understanding or quality that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.610" end="01:19:22.770" style="s2">we embody right in our search which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.090" end="01:19:26.040" style="s2">the sense of like that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.770" end="01:19:28.410" style="s2">that were it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.040" end="01:19:31.020" style="s2">dominate or get clear about something</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.410" end="01:19:35.130" style="s2">it&#39;s more like looking and loving truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.020" end="01:19:37.770" style="s2">and to look for truth is to look towards</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.130" end="01:19:40.080" style="s2">concealment right so to be oriented</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.770" end="01:19:44.250" style="s2">towards that which is is yet unveiled</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.080" end="01:19:46.410" style="s2">and I think I think that&#39;s why a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.250" end="01:19:48.870" style="s2">the conversation is about the times that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.410" end="01:19:53.160" style="s2">we live in and as I think as Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.870" end="01:19:57.090" style="s2">would say is is is is that the time that</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.160" end="01:19:59.100" style="s2">we&#39;re living that technol framing age of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.090" end="01:20:00.989" style="s2">technology that we&#39;re in is not</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.100" end="01:20:04.650" style="s2">technological devices and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.989" end="01:20:07.380" style="s2">technology itself it&#39;s the UH the way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.650" end="01:20:09.630" style="s2">understanding everything at all</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.380" end="01:20:12.239" style="s2">everything that&#39;s anything at all by</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.630" end="01:20:16.800" style="s2">virtue of which we understand it as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.239" end="01:20:21.000" style="s2">kind of standing in reserved fully</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.800" end="01:20:24.660" style="s2">available right you optimized to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.000" end="01:20:26.219" style="s2">extracted to be ordered to fungus the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.660" end="01:20:28.920" style="s2">death that you&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.219" end="01:20:31.620" style="s2">annoying yeah yes in what it conceals</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.920" end="01:20:33.420" style="s2">and what he would say is the danger and</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.620" end="01:20:36.060" style="s2">he also said this is the saving power</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.420" end="01:20:40.739" style="s2">within the danger is the same a bonus</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.060" end="01:20:43.980" style="s2">folder in there right is is is is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.739" end="01:20:46.200" style="s2">danger is that this is what demarcates</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.980" end="01:20:48.120" style="s2">this understanding of everything that is</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.200" end="01:20:52.860" style="s2">the understanding of being of our time</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.120" end="01:20:55.290" style="s2">is that it is what it what it on what it</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.860" end="01:20:59.820" style="s2">conceals is that there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.290" end="01:21:02.870" style="s2">concealed right okay optimizes so</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.820" end="01:21:05.850" style="s2">everything&#39;s available everything is</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.870" end="01:21:07.650" style="s2">including ourselves we are now part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.850" end="01:21:09.150" style="s2">the standing reserve in</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.650" end="01:21:10.949" style="s2">which if you just look at our attitudes</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.150" end="01:21:12.420" style="s2">about ourselves is like we look at her</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.949" end="01:21:15.860" style="s2">bodies like it&#39;s something dislike look</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.420" end="01:21:19.590" style="s2">let&#39;s hack the shit out of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.860" end="01:21:22.590" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s extract all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.590" end="01:21:24.510" style="s2">and make and release all the potential</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.590" end="01:21:29.250" style="s2">out of ourselves so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.510" end="01:21:34.980" style="s2">harnessed it and order it and that is so</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.250" end="01:21:41.340" style="s2">deep in its both outside and it&#39;s him</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.980" end="01:21:43.730" style="s2">and I think what what verb a key is is</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.340" end="01:21:49.020" style="s2">talking about with the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.730" end="01:21:53.460" style="s2">what Jordan Hall his determination is</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.020" end="01:21:57.030" style="s2">sense of like deep urgency right all</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.460" end="01:21:59.429" style="s2">like fierce urgency and like systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.030" end="01:22:03.960" style="s2">thinking so all on some level it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.429" end="01:22:06.270" style="s2">it&#39;s through harkening this sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.960" end="01:22:10.530" style="s2">concealment of all that is right then</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.270" end="01:22:12.300" style="s2">get fullness of me right and in that and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.530" end="01:22:15.210" style="s2">that I think this is what really</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.300" end="01:22:18.360" style="s2">Heidegger brings to for that I really</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.210" end="01:22:21.060" style="s2">resonate with which is like we&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="01:22:21.060" end="01:22:28.230" style="s2">complete withdrawal and that so if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.020" end="01:22:31.949" style="s2">want to read if you want to reveal like</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.230" end="01:22:33.739" style="s2">being notice like look at where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.949" end="01:22:36.510" style="s2">withdrawing because that&#39;s where it is</p>

<p begin="01:22:36.510" end="01:22:42.540" style="s2">something is it is that you have to look</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.710" end="01:22:46.800" style="s2">at the Putra fication or you have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.540" end="01:22:50.280" style="s2">look at that at the at the image of you</p>

<p begin="01:23:14.850" end="01:23:18.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s the question I think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.070" end="01:23:21.060" style="s2">we&#39;re on some level whether or not we</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.750" end="01:23:24.060" style="s2">can conceptualize it or</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.060" end="01:23:26.820" style="s2">not like like there&#39;s a I think one</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.060" end="01:23:29.160" style="s2">other thing that is gathering this we</p>

<p begin="01:23:41.490" end="01:23:45.450" style="s2">in our lives and the structures of</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.200" end="01:23:48.300" style="s2">institution that they they&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.450" end="01:23:51.060" style="s2">things don&#39;t have any sense to them they</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.300" end="01:23:54.090" style="s2">like hmm they don&#39;t hannah and sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.060" end="01:23:56.460" style="s2">right and and I think this is I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.090" end="01:23:59.070" style="s2">that a lot of a lot of the symptom but</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.460" end="01:24:02.130" style="s2">symptom ology is why we&#39;re like people</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.070" end="01:24:04.800" style="s2">are getting so moralistic because on</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.130" end="01:24:07.200" style="s2">some level they&#39;re trying to bring sense</p>

<p begin="01:24:08.990" end="01:24:15.840" style="s2">morality then you get shallow morality</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.810" end="01:24:19.230" style="s2">instead of genuine ethics or genuine</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.840" end="01:24:21.240" style="s2">action or or you know yeah the schools</p>

<p begin="01:25:41.850" end="01:25:47.040" style="s2">because he says a lot of again yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.500" end="01:25:48.960" style="s2">has a sort of offensive yeah comes on in</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.040" end="01:25:51.510" style="s2">this offensive way but then he always</p>

<p begin="01:25:55.490" end="01:26:01.290" style="s2">continental philosophy which is not not</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.230" end="01:26:05.490" style="s2">that present in in theologian so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.290" end="01:26:08.970" style="s2">very living about his thinking he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.490" end="01:26:11.010" style="s2">he like he&#39;s encountered Heidegger and</p>

<p begin="01:26:13.050" end="01:26:19.190" style="s2">the things he said so a lot a lot of how</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.960" end="01:26:21.090" style="s2">he&#39;s become popular amongst you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.190" end="01:26:24.810" style="s2">non-academics is is through writing</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.090" end="01:26:28.980" style="s2">books in response to the to atheism to</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.810" end="01:26:30.390" style="s2">the you know the new yes ran and I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.980" end="01:26:34.010" style="s2">and I really kind of got this and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.390" end="01:26:37.410" style="s2">think this exemplifies real did you um</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.010" end="01:26:41.250" style="s2">when he was speaking to a claim by I</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.410" end="01:26:42.870" style="s2">think Dawkins is like well like how can</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.250" end="01:26:45.330" style="s2">you say that there&#39;s a God how can you</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.870" end="01:26:46.650" style="s2">prove it like put like how can you prove</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.330" end="01:26:48.480" style="s2">it like you know that that whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.650" end="01:26:51.120" style="s2">I&#39;m sure they&#39;re gonna be like well okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.480" end="01:26:53.100" style="s2">so if we were to run like well if we</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.120" end="01:26:56.850" style="s2">were to run an experiment what we would</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.100" end="01:27:01.200" style="s2">need to do mr. Dawkins is you need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.850" end="01:27:03.870" style="s2">like in the way that he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.200" end="01:27:05.760" style="s2">God right the way that like I David Hart</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.870" end="01:27:08.420" style="s2">in the crook like the Christian at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.760" end="01:27:11.760" style="s2">deepest sense of the word the theistic</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.420" end="01:27:13.230" style="s2">sensibility about God is like well what</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:16.350" style="s2">you would need to do is he would need to</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.230" end="01:27:19.920" style="s2">probably spend two three years going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.350" end="01:27:24.360" style="s2">church praying going in contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:26.520" style="s2">prayer doing lectio divina going through</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.360" end="01:27:29.040" style="s2">the river right the ceremonies the</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.520" end="01:27:32.730" style="s2">confessions the he&#39;s like and then like</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.040" end="01:27:35.400" style="s2">two three years later right then we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.730" end="01:27:37.260" style="s2">take a look then we can have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.400" end="01:27:39.600" style="s2">conversation about religion right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.260" end="01:27:42.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like like then then and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.600" end="01:27:44.700" style="s2">start to talk about the presence it the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.150" end="01:27:46.860" style="s2">proof of the presence of God and I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:48.120" style="s2">this is what I think for Becky I&#39;m my</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.860" end="01:27:49.860" style="s2">understanding of her Becky</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.120" end="01:27:52.740" style="s2">is when he&#39;s talking about participatory</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.860" end="01:27:54.870" style="s2">knowing that there&#39;s participatory</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.740" end="01:27:57.060" style="s2">knowing is part of what it&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.870" end="01:27:59.820" style="s2">through being presents and so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.060" end="01:28:04.110" style="s2">enactment of participating in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.820" end="01:28:07.470" style="s2">religion right is so intimately woven</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.110" end="01:28:09.300" style="s2">with God right so you can just get the</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.470" end="01:28:11.160" style="s2">sense of like if Dawkins went and did</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.300" end="01:28:12.600" style="s2">that for three years it&#39;s very feasible</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.160" end="01:28:15.960" style="s2">that he would come out at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.600" end="01:28:19.710" style="s2">that you&#39;d be like yeah whoa the</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.960" end="01:28:21.930" style="s2">presence of God right is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.710" end="01:28:25.440" style="s2">devote you can&#39;t uncollapse it from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.930" end="01:28:27.390" style="s2">the knowing of participation yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.440" end="01:28:29.580" style="s2">I think for Becky&#39;s kind of basically</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.390" end="01:28:33.330" style="s2">coming along with like religio is like</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.580" end="01:28:36.720" style="s2">well perhaps perhaps what we just need</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.330" end="01:28:40.260" style="s2">to do is not pretend like we can have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.720" end="01:28:43.320" style="s2">proposition that&#39;s unscientific like lo</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.260" end="01:28:45.320" style="s2">let&#39;s you can&#39;t kiss you can&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.320" end="01:28:48.420" style="s2">already happened we&#39;re so imbued with</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.320" end="01:28:50.490" style="s2">science and technology that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.420" end="01:28:53.130" style="s2">understand ourselves in it right you</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.490" end="01:28:55.890" style="s2">can&#39;t just decide not to be so I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.130" end="01:28:59.460" style="s2">what what what Verbeck he&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.890" end="01:29:02.100" style="s2">he&#39;s not trying to piss in the wind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.460" end="01:29:04.770" style="s2">history he&#39;s basically kind of really</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.100" end="01:29:06.930" style="s2">taking our fate and seeing and this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.770" end="01:29:10.140" style="s2">what I think is the right way to respond</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.930" end="01:29:12.930" style="s2">to this age of technology is not not</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.140" end="01:29:15.960" style="s2">being again but like developing it</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.930" end="01:29:18.150" style="s2">beyond itself mmm I think I think I</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.960" end="01:29:20.160" style="s2">sense that sensibility in verb aching</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.150" end="01:29:23.310" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s he&#39;s not trying</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.160" end="01:29:27.300" style="s2">to start a religion he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.310" end="01:29:29.580" style="s2">disclose the the intelligibility of all</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.300" end="01:29:32.790" style="s2">those practices well actually that was</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.580" end="01:29:35.610" style="s2">Birds kind of criticism of him that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.790" end="01:29:38.070" style="s2">like oh you you&#39;re actually what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.610" end="01:29:41.280" style="s2">talking about is religion you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.070" end="01:29:42.990" style="s2">that is a religion well the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.280" end="01:29:45.450" style="s2">is the what your credits what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.990" end="01:29:48.630" style="s2">criticizing what Dawkins is criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.450" end="01:29:52.320" style="s2">you know is it a dead religion you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.630" end="01:29:55.890" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have to believe in the God</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.320" end="01:29:56.790" style="s2">that Dawkins doesn&#39;t believe in right</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.890" end="01:29:58.740" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.790" end="01:29:59.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s something we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.740" end="01:30:03.020" style="s2">about we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.760" end="01:30:03.020" style="s2">fundamental sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.290" end="01:30:10.730" style="s2">communal aspect of humanity and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.670" end="01:30:14.330" style="s2">that&#39;s that begins in the first stone</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.730" end="01:30:18.940" style="s2">yeah that you that you build of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.330" end="01:30:22.460" style="s2">first temple right yeah totally so yeah</p>

<p begin="01:30:25.460" end="01:30:27.860" style="s2">to go we don&#39;t want to go back to an</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.960" end="01:30:30.650" style="s2">Iron Age</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.860" end="01:30:34.130" style="s2">really yeah but but we wanted as you say</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.650" end="01:30:35.990" style="s2">disclosed and this is where I think the</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.130" end="01:30:36.890" style="s2">essence of it I think with bard and in</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.990" end="01:30:41.390" style="s2">response to bard</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.890" end="01:30:43.340" style="s2">first of all bark like bard it i I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.390" end="01:30:45.740" style="s2">been listening to bard everything I can</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.340" end="01:30:49.490" style="s2">like all the videos that come out in his</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.740" end="01:30:50.630" style="s2">books a bard is like he&#39;s something man</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.490" end="01:30:55.460" style="s2">I like him a lot</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.630" end="01:30:58.850" style="s2">yeah in in a he&#39;s I just get this sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.460" end="01:31:00.560" style="s2">he&#39;s on fire like there&#39;s used to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.850" end="01:31:03.080" style="s2">he&#39;s Nietzsche with the hammer</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.560" end="01:31:04.580" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s exactly exactly what you do</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.080" end="01:31:07.430" style="s2">with the hammer in the same and the way</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.580" end="01:31:11.600" style="s2">that John is Socrates are you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.430" end="01:31:13.220" style="s2">Socrates with the question you know Bart</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.600" end="01:31:16.100" style="s2">is Nietzsche with the hammer it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.220" end="01:31:18.350" style="s2">actually we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.100" end="01:31:19.670" style="s2">those two together in Toronto and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.350" end="01:31:22.310" style="s2">looking I&#39;m looking forward to that</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.670" end="01:31:23.930" style="s2">April yeah looking forward to that and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.310" end="01:31:26.990" style="s2">have a feeling that there is something</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.930" end="01:31:29.660" style="s2">paradoxical there yeah right cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.990" end="01:31:31.820" style="s2">like when he says so for example in in</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.660" end="01:31:33.920" style="s2">bards response to it he&#39;s like like no</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.820" end="01:31:36.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to get rid</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.920" end="01:31:40.790" style="s2">of the religion and like and do this</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.740" end="01:31:42.710" style="s2">kind of weird kind of emergent sense of</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.790" end="01:31:44.270" style="s2">you know you know he talks about when he</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.710" end="01:31:47.060" style="s2">starts breaking things apart right</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.270" end="01:31:49.610" style="s2">hitting with with the hammer actually I</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.060" end="01:31:53.780" style="s2">think when he says no we need to be more</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.610" end="01:31:56.000" style="s2">religious yeah right - I sense an echo</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.780" end="01:31:58.370" style="s2">of that is I think that there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.000" end="01:31:59.840" style="s2">which they&#39;re actually I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.370" end="01:32:01.550" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about the same thing but</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.840" end="01:32:03.860" style="s2">I think they&#39;re talking about that which</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.550" end="01:32:06.050" style="s2">has multiple aspects to it</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.860" end="01:32:07.820" style="s2">MMH right but there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.050" end="01:32:10.850" style="s2">there&#39;s something there wedded to and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.820" end="01:32:13.070" style="s2">have a feeling that C so the phallus</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.850" end="01:32:15.080" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t know if I understand</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.070" end="01:32:17.330" style="s2">exactly what he means by that but I</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.080" end="01:32:19.670" style="s2">but based on what I do understand or my</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.330" end="01:32:22.880" style="s2">misunderstanding see it strikes me is</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.670" end="01:32:26.210" style="s2">like it it&#39;s actually very penetrating</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.880" end="01:32:30.160" style="s2">to like there&#39;s a penetration quality to</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.210" end="01:32:36.890" style="s2">it but the penetration right now is like</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.160" end="01:32:40.000" style="s2">if for example we can no longer have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.890" end="01:32:44.690" style="s2">proposition right that demarcates</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.000" end="01:32:47.150" style="s2">metaphysics right like that you just we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.690" end="01:32:50.060" style="s2">can tweak we can&#39;t make ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.150" end="01:32:52.100" style="s2">believe in that anymore like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.060" end="01:32:55.910" style="s2">that&#39;s our fate we are in a new age</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.100" end="01:32:58.010" style="s2">right that even even deeply rather about</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.910" end="01:33:01.700" style="s2">that maybe we can make ourselves believe</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.010" end="01:33:02.990" style="s2">in that maybe maybe there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.700" end="01:33:07.760" style="s2">things that happen that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.990" end="01:33:12.050" style="s2">understand exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.760" end="01:33:14.600" style="s2">well that thing that we we can believe</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.050" end="01:33:18.320" style="s2">in that we don&#39;t understand all right I</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.600" end="01:33:21.110" style="s2">think what I think what it&#39;s that right</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.320" end="01:33:24.350" style="s2">which is where the phallus needs to</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.110" end="01:33:27.860" style="s2">penetrate right mm-hmm it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.350" end="01:33:31.490" style="s2">to propose and make a claim right of</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.860" end="01:33:34.520" style="s2">like this is it right then you start to</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.490" end="01:33:36.710" style="s2">evoke all of the fucking things that</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.520" end="01:33:39.350" style="s2">like historically have just made things</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.710" end="01:33:41.920" style="s2">go to shit right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.350" end="01:33:44.000" style="s2">but I think the penetration is in is</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.920" end="01:33:45.730" style="s2">actually being able to stay with the</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.000" end="01:33:51.880" style="s2">mystery and reveal the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.730" end="01:33:55.970" style="s2">mystery with to that which cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.880" end="01:33:59.680" style="s2">proposed be housed in a proposition and</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.970" end="01:34:04.300" style="s2">that that actually besides that that is</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.680" end="01:34:04.300" style="s2">the thing that animates our lives</p>
