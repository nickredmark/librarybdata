<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:06.600" style="s2">I talked about what we&#39;re going to cover last time, but there I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.600" end="00:00:10.120" style="s2"> not finished yet. So I&#39;m going to finish that. For those who weren&#39;t there last time:</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.120" end="00:00:16.250" style="s2"> you can view the lecture, because it is online. We stopped at the depth psychologists,</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:22.159" style="s2"> that&#39;s the psychoanalysts. And the psychoanalysts are concerned with ...</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.159" end="00:00:29.890" style="s2"> To a psychoanalyst you are, as it were, a collection of somewhat integrated minds.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.890" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2"> This is how you can see it as sub-personalities. You are not a unity.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:40.100" style="s2"> And those sub-personalities are anchored in ... in all kinds of things.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.100" end="00:00:46.370" style="s2"> They can arise from past experiences, especially from traumatic experiences. Or through socialization patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.370" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2"> characteristic of your family. But they can also be rooted in basic biologicals</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:58.540" style="s2"> motivation systems. For example, a psychoanalyst would conceptualize anger or sexual attraction as</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.540" end="00:01:04.390" style="s2"> a subpersonality. And the reason for that is ... you know what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.390" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2"> when you get angry. You get mad at someone you love</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:14.630" style="s2"> and in a way you want to harm someone. You may just be arguing</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.630" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2"> want to win, and bring the other down while doing that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2"> But there is a desire that comes with anger. But many other things also happen.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:27.430" style="s2"> For example, if someone annoys you even though you love them,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.430" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2"> you will probably have easy access to all the memories you have at that point</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.440" style="s2"> how annoying he is, and difficult to access the memories of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.440" end="00:01:41.120" style="s2"> how good he has been to you. You know that because sometimes you get angry</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.120" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2"> on someone, and you have a discussion. And only later do you realize what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:50.030" style="s2"> you come back to your senses, out of that possessed state, and you think, &quot;Yes, I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.030" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2"> didn&#39;t really take context into account, and I was kind of blunt. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.510" style="s2"> Then you think, &quot;Who&#39;s in charge?&quot; And that is the question where the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.510" end="00:02:04.280" style="s2"> are very interested in, and their answer is, &quot;Not generally you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.280" end="00:02:08.229" style="s2"> In a way, it is terrifying reading, because people like to think of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.229" end="00:02:14.940" style="s2"> as the boss of their own house, so to speak, and that&#39;s only somewhat true.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.940" end="00:02:22.450" style="s2"> You know that, because at the turn of the year you have ... what are those things called?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.450" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2"> Good intentions. How you will improve yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.640" style="s2"> One of the most common is: You will go to the gym three times a week.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.640" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2"> Not so. Very few people do that,</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.849" style="s2"> because it is difficult, and people don&#39;t like to do difficult things.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.849" end="00:02:41.819" style="s2"> Because they are difficult, so that requires little explanation. But it also comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.819" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2"> because you can&#39;t just tell yourself what to do. And that is annoying, because life</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:50.660" style="s2"> would be much easier if you could just say, &quot;Okay, sit down, study for two hours,</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.660" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2"> don&#39;t watch cat videos on YouTube, or whatever you watch. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:57.849" style="s2"> But no, it doesn&#39;t work like that. You sit there and study for a while,</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.849" end="00:03:01.569" style="s2"> and then you start thinking about cats, and before you know it, you&#39;re off to haunted houses</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.569" end="00:03:09.629" style="s2"> in London, or something like that. It&#39;s a scary idea because</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.629" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2"> if you are not in charge of your own house ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.110" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2"> If you&#39;re not completely in control of yourself, which is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:18.770" style="s2"> what controls you then?</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.770" end="00:03:23.590" style="s2"> And Freud is interesting in that regard, because he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.590" end="00:03:28.030" style="s2"> the driving force of fundamental motivation systems. For Freud these were mainly aggression and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.030" end="00:03:31.660" style="s2"> sexuality. And those are important drivers, make no mistake.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.660" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2"> He saw you as ... saw the conscious part of your personality ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2"> like the captain of a ship with a very headstrong crew. That&#39;s a nice metaphor.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:47.900" style="s2"> For the ship is on the sea, and the sea can be very rough.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.900" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2"> You can only set a course, and then you have to deal with what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2"> And the stubborn shipmen, those are your urges ... but you shouldn&#39;t see them as drifts.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2"> I like the psychoanalytic idea of ​​subpersonality because a subpersonality</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:10.629" style="s2"> has a perspective. It wants things and has plans. It&#39;s a living entity,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.629" end="00:04:15.819" style="s2"> not a lifeless cognitive system. Freud was more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.819" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2"> the biological foundation of the sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2"> Because he was highly biologically oriented and he realized sexuality and aggression</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.820" end="00:04:28.570" style="s2"> were very basic sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.570" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2"> And then you have Jung, and Jung is far more terrifying than Freud. Which is telling,</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:37.970" style="s2"> because Freud is pretty scary. But Jung is incredibly terrifying.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.970" end="00:04:44.440" style="s2"> According to Jung, the sub-personalities that make up you are thousands of years old.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.440" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2"> They are cultural constructions that are thousands of years old,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:53.389" style="s2"> and who have you in their grip. For example, Jung said,</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.389" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2"> i don&#39;t remember where i love this phrase it&#39;s so accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2"> You can think about it for five years, and still after that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2"> Jung said, &quot;People don&#39;t have ideas, ideas own people.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2"> That&#39;s something to think about, because think about your own situation.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:16.889" style="s2"> No doubt you have political ideas, and you think, &quot;I have political ideas.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.889" end="00:05:21.389" style="s2"> No, not really, because you share those ideas with a lot of other people.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.389" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2"> So they are definitely not yours. And not only that, they have had a long historical development</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2"> before you were there at all. They are grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2"> the depth of your culture. And they have been elaborated extensively by</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2"> one philosopher after another over the past two or three hundred years.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:45.979" style="s2"> There&#39;s that whole system of thought, and &quot;poof!&quot; it takes over your brain, and you think:</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.979" end="00:05:53.220" style="s2"> &quot;I have political ideas.&quot; Um, no, the political ideas own you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.220" end="00:05:58.919" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a wholesome thought, because that&#39;s one of the ways of controlling your obsession</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.919" end="00:06:03.669" style="s2"> to stop. Because people are constantly possessed by ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.669" end="00:06:07.970" style="s2"> That&#39;s what happened in Nazi Germany, that&#39;s what happened in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.970" end="00:06:13.570" style="s2"> It happens all the time everywhere. You may think, &quot;Possession is a bit strong.&quot; But that&#39;s not true.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.570" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2"> Obviously it is a metaphor, but it is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:23.690" style="s2"> appropriate metaphor, for a collection of ideas, such as political ideas, are a living thing.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.690" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2"> They are not lifeless, dusty words on a bookshelf, somewhere. They are part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:35.729" style="s2"> a dynamic society. And the driving force of those ideas motivates you. They have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.729" end="00:06:40.770" style="s2"> in their grasp. You can tell when you talk to someone who is completely obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.770" end="00:06:45.650" style="s2"> an idea system, or an ideological system, because that is deadly boring.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.650" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2"> Unless you happen to believe the same. They will be some of their own</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:55.350" style="s2"> ventilate fundamental axioms, and then you can see to which system they belong. And then they express</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.350" end="00:06:59.770" style="s2"> only clichés, and can you predict everything they will say,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.770" end="00:07:06.310" style="s2"> if you know the axioms of the system. That is very inauthentic language.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.310" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2"> For example, someone like Rogers or Abraham Maslow, humanists would explain</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.169" style="s2"> the sixties, talk about it. Because that person does not speak from the depth</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.169" end="00:07:21.310" style="s2"> of his own experience, or his physical knowledge. He&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.310" end="00:07:23.940" style="s2"> mouthpiece for abstract ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.940" end="00:07:29.590" style="s2"> It is very frightening to realize how much you can be the mouthpiece</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.590" end="00:07:34.509" style="s2"> for abstract ideas. And that&#39;s one of the dangers of education</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.509" end="00:07:38.389" style="s2"> especially in a mass system such as the university. Because what happens a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.389" end="00:07:45.880" style="s2"> when you go to university, you are presented with a number of preconceived ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.880" end="00:07:50.199" style="s2"> so you can see it. And it is very easy to think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.199" end="00:07:56.630" style="s2"> now your ideas are. That is not true. You have to earn a lot of ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.630" end="00:08:01.259" style="s2"> and if it&#39;s a great idea, you really have to earn it. Why would you just</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.259" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2"> adopt a great idea? It doesn&#39;t work like that. Things that are valuable</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:08.190" style="s2"> you have to earn.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.190" end="00:08:12.060" style="s2"> Regardless, the depth psychologists are so good at that, it&#39;s a pleasure to read them.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.060" end="00:08:15.990" style="s2"> The problem with many of the people that we will discuss is that it is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.990" end="00:08:21.130" style="s2"> to summarize their work. Because the details are often very important.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.130" end="00:08:24.590" style="s2"> Take Piaget for example, the constructivist where we put it</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.590" end="00:08:28.840" style="s2"> briefly mentioned. That man has written dozens of books, you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.840" end="00:08:34.409" style="s2"> not really summarize. It is not one coherent theory that can be reduced to ten axioms,</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.409" end="00:08:38.550" style="s2"> which you can read when flying from Toronto to Montreal, and &quot;poof!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.550" end="00:08:43.419" style="s2"> you are a piagetian psychologist. It doesn&#39;t work like that. The people who formulated these theories</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.419" end="00:08:49.459" style="s2"> were very intelligent, and often very good writers.</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.459" end="00:08:53.699" style="s2"> Much of the knowledge is in how they write, not what you can get out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.699" end="00:08:58.689" style="s2"> With most theorists, Freud, with Jung it is more difficult,</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.689" end="00:09:03.329" style="s2"> but with Freud, Rogers, such people ... You can distil the most important thing from their theories,</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.329" end="00:09:11.259" style="s2"> then you can make a stereotype or caricature of it,</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.259" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2"> and you can point out that that caricature is absurd, and then you can, you get smarter</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:20.550" style="s2"> then feel Freud. But you are not. So that&#39;s not a good idea.</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.550" end="00:09:24.519" style="s2"> These people should be treated with respect because they have so much to tell you.</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.519" end="00:09:25.709" style="s2"> It&#39;s so useful.</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.709" end="00:09:31.119" style="s2"> All right, we&#39;ve been talking about the depth psychologists, and we&#39;ve been talking about the constructivists.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.119" end="00:09:35.980" style="s2"> We have not yet talked about the humanists and the existentialists and the phenomenologists.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.980" end="00:09:42.079" style="s2"> Those are a lot of difficult words, so let&#39;s build a foundation for it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.079" end="00:09:48.129" style="s2"> To be a humanist means to be a child of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.129" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2"> Humanistic ideas, at least that is how the humanists see it,</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:59.089" style="s2"> is &quot;post-religious.&quot; According to them, it places humanistic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.089" end="00:10:04.509" style="s2"> the value of man at the center of the world. Appreciate a person</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.509" end="00:10:12.790" style="s2"> as he is, and also appreciate how he could be. And promoting the ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.790" end="00:10:17.929" style="s2"> of development that enables humans to become what they could be, as creatures</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.929" end="00:10:24.949" style="s2"> which are valuable as such. For example, a humanist would be skeptical of claims ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.949" end="00:10:32.449" style="s2"> let&#39;s say Christian assertions, and I use that example because it is the domain of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.449" end="00:10:38.139" style="s2"> where these thinkers appeared was almost always Judeo-Christian.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.139" end="00:10:41.759" style="s2"> The background of their ideas is formed by those systems, and you cannot understand their thinking,</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.759" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2"> without understanding it. In part, humanism was a rebellion against the idea of ​​life on Earth</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:51.369" style="s2"> had only limited value, because the important things only</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.369" end="00:10:56.249" style="s2"> after death would take place in the afterlife. &quot;No, it&#39;s about the here and now.</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.249" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2"> The present moment is important. This life is important.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:05.379" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t need an afterlife, or the belief in a transcendent reality,</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.379" end="00:11:10.019" style="s2"> to find value in the here and now. &quot;Good. That idea has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.019" end="00:11:11.399" style="s2"> good aspects.</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.399" end="00:11:17.610" style="s2"> The idea that you can improve yourself is, in a sense, a humanistic idea.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.610" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2"> How many of you believe you can improve yourself? Is there anyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:29.699" style="s2"> who doesn&#39;t believe that? And would like to admit that? Usually people don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.699" end="00:11:33.499" style="s2"> if they are very depressed or desperate. But it cannot be taken for granted.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.499" end="00:11:38.049" style="s2"> In many cultures, in medieval Europe for example,</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.049" end="00:11:42.379" style="s2"> you were, as it were, stuck in your position, there was not really an idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.379" end="00:11:47.319" style="s2"> of self-improvement. You could try not to sin, but you wouldn&#39;t get radically better</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.319" end="00:11:53.009" style="s2"> in one way or another. You were just who you were, and that was it. But the humanists see it differently.</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.009" end="00:11:54.209" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:54.209" end="00:11:59.879" style="s2"> The existentialists are a special type of thinkers.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.879" end="00:12:04.579" style="s2"> When Freud talks about psychopathology, because a lot of personality theory is about pathology,</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.579" end="00:12:09.529" style="s2"> how personalities develop wrong ... Freud sees the normal person</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.529" end="00:12:15.689" style="s2"> as healthy, but he can turn into a pathological version of himself</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.689" end="00:12:20.439" style="s2"> from past trauma. Often this is due to abuse in childhood,</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.439" end="00:12:25.459" style="s2"> or perhaps through childhood sexual abuse. Freud talked about that a lot,</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.459" end="00:12:32.410" style="s2"> and it is common. According to Freud, if you were not well,</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.410" end="00:12:36.489" style="s2"> then that had a cause. Something terrible had happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.489" end="00:12:40.619" style="s2"> you had to learn to deal with that, in whatever way,</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.619" end="00:12:45.350" style="s2"> put yourself in order, and then you could go on as a healthy person.</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.350" end="00:12:49.439" style="s2"> But the existentialists think very differently. They think that every normal person</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.439" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2"> is pathological. They think so because they exist self-consciously,</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:13:01.410" style="s2"> the life of a creature that knows its limits in time and space,</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.410" end="00:13:06.939" style="s2"> its vulnerability to illness and death, and the loss of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.939" end="00:13:12.059" style="s2"> what he loves, and the disintegration of all things in a sense ... That&#39;s problematic enough,</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.059" end="00:13:17.959" style="s2"> to have problems without being abused.</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.959" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2"> The existentialists see life as such as a serious enough problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:29.259" style="s2"> to destabilize you mentally just by being aware of it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.259" end="00:13:33.859" style="s2"> And they think that is why people often have their own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.859" end="00:13:38.199" style="s2"> flee. How do you deal with the fact that life is suffering?</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.199" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2"> By not thinking about it. That is not a good answer for an existentialist.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:47.389" style="s2"> And in general, that&#39;s not a good answer for clinical psychologists, either.</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.389" end="00:13:53.720" style="s2"> The literature very strongly suggests that the harder you run from something,</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.720" end="00:13:59.660" style="s2"> what you fear, the bigger it gets, and the faster it chases you.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.660" end="00:14:05.549" style="s2"> Avoidance is generally a very bad strategy. That&#39;s not always the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.549" end="00:14:10.759" style="s2"> because sometimes you can&#39;t change anything, you really can&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.759" end="00:14:15.769" style="s2"> Then it makes no sense to spend a lot of time on anticipation and resistance.</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.769" end="00:14:21.109" style="s2"> And sometimes people really find themselves in hopeless situations, but often not.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.109" end="00:14:25.329" style="s2"> I like the existentialists. I think their ... basically all the people we&#39;ll be talking about ...</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.329" end="00:14:32.519" style="s2"> their ideas are extremely valuable. It helps you position yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.519" end="00:14:36.559" style="s2"> in your own life. It clarifies your relationship with other people and the world.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.559" end="00:14:41.549" style="s2"> It helps you shape the future, as it could be. If you were</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.549" end="00:14:43.329" style="s2"> who you can be. That&#39;s very beautiful.</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.329" end="00:14:52.040" style="s2"> The phenomenologists are a complicated group. The fundamental phenomenologist was Martin Heidegger,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.040" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2"> which was also somewhat associated with the Nazis, which of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:04.439" style="s2"> was not a good thing. People argue about whether you are philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.439" end="00:15:12.230" style="s2"> apart from his affiliation with the Nazis, and I think that is possible.</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.230" end="00:15:21.309" style="s2"> Heidegger wanted to re-examine the nature of reality. Heidegger&#39;s idea was</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.309" end="00:15:26.429" style="s2"> that we had made a fundamental philosophical mistake in ancient Greek times.</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.429" end="00:15:33.160" style="s2"> That we started to focus on the wrong elements of ... he doesn&#39;t mention it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.160" end="00:15:39.439" style="s2"> reality, he calls it &quot;being.&quot; A phenomenologist is someone who is concerned with being.</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.439" end="00:15:42.919" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;What&#39;s the difference between being and reality?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.919" end="00:15:48.809" style="s2"> The answer is that it depends on how you define &quot;being&quot; and how you define &quot;reality&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.809" end="00:15:56.239" style="s2"> Heidegger&#39;s observation was the reality for modern people</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.239" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2"> is a kind of lifeless, material, objective substrate. It&#39;s essentially dead, so to speak,</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:08.529" style="s2"> and most real things are like that. You can see that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.529" end="00:16:14.509" style="s2"> objective reality. But Heidegger pointed out that that is a choice,</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.509" end="00:16:20.489" style="s2"> in a way. Because your knowledge is limited, and because you are fundamentally ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.489" end="00:16:25.669" style="s2"> about all things, you must decide that some things are true, and then based on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.669" end="00:16:29.429" style="s2"> to trade. And Heidegger&#39;s point was: there are many things about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.429" end="00:16:35.259" style="s2"> you decide on an axiomatic level. One of the things about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.259" end="00:16:39.989" style="s2"> you can decide, for example, is whether the objective world is more real,</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.989" end="00:16:44.619" style="s2"> or that your lived experience is more real.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.619" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot; I would say:</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2"> &quot;The difference is like seeing someone hurt in a movie, or being hurt themselves.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:04.010" style="s2"> Pain is a great example of an element of being because it is obvious ... because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.010" end="00:17:11.490" style="s2"> experiences it within your own ... it is difficult to explain because he uses different terminology.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.490" end="00:17:19.110" style="s2"> Pain is an element of your existence. It&#39;s not something ... the pain as such</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.110" end="00:17:23.480" style="s2"> you cannot conceptualize in objective terms. You can measure it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.480" end="00:17:26.449" style="s2"> Maybe your heart rate speeds up when you are in pain or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.449" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2"> Whether your facial expression changes. You can schedule it, but the schedules are slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2"> than the phenomenon. Hence the term &quot;phenomenology.&quot; The phenomenologists have</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2"> built a complete thinking system, based on the axiom that is the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.710" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2"> to approach life is to assume that being is the basic reality, rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:51.450" style="s2"> the objective as the fundamental level.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.450" end="00:17:54.309" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;Why are people concerned with that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.309" end="00:17:59.690" style="s2"> Partly because ... this is an existentialist thesis: one consequence</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.690" end="00:18:05.169" style="s2"> of developing the objective theory of existence is incredible technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.169" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2"> that surrounds us. And thank goodness for that, otherwise we would be out in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:14.529" style="s2"> freezing cold. But one of the consequences was that when humans determined objective reality,</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.529" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2"> and that defined as the ultimate reality, there were terrible questions about the meaning of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:25.259" style="s2"> life arose. If the world consists of nothing but dead matter,</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.259" end="00:18:30.200" style="s2"> is endless, and we are nothing but a flickering light in the wind, then the thought creeps over you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.200" end="00:18:35.470" style="s2"> that all the suffering may not be worth it. In other words:</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.470" end="00:18:41.759" style="s2"> does your life really have meaning, or is that an illusion?</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.759" end="00:18:45.850" style="s2"> Heidegger would say you have that problem because you have the issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.850" end="00:18:51.309" style="s2"> wrong approach. Obviously things have meaning. Only not if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.309" end="00:18:57.399" style="s2"> the hypothesis assumes that the objective is ultimate reality, and everything else is only secondary.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.399" end="00:19:04.539" style="s2"> It&#39;s complicated, it takes a while to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.539" end="00:19:09.070" style="s2"> The humanists, existentialists and to some extent the phenomenologists,</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.070" end="00:19:14.409" style="s2"> all came from ... there were different sources for their thinking, and I would say one of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.409" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2"> the conflict is between religion and science, or between value and objective truth.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:24.490" style="s2"> They are trying to reconsider that divorce. And Piaget also tried to do something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.490" end="00:19:29.779" style="s2"> And also Jung, I think. Another aspect is that many existentialists</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.779" end="00:19:35.759" style="s2"> and humanists worked after World War II. After World War II took place,</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.759" end="00:19:39.820" style="s2"> with all its horrors, people who thought about human nature were, of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:44.090" style="s2"> very interested in how such a thing could happen. Existentialism, at least if</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:50.580" style="s2"> a psychological school, came about in part as a response to the horrors of the Second World War.</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.580" end="00:19:56.149" style="s2"> It is a very serious form of psychology, and is characteristic of thinking in the fifties,</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.149" end="00:20:00.679" style="s2"> before the hippies came and made everything sweet and light.</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.679" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2"> That&#39;s more where you can put Rogers and Maslow.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:09.240" style="s2"> We&#39;ll talk about that pretty extensively, those three categories.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.240" end="00:20:13.090" style="s2"> It&#39;s a bit of a strange approach in this lecture series because I&#39;ll be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.090" end="00:20:19.029" style="s2"> a number of psychologists from that period, but the other people I will mainly discuss,</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.029" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2"> are not actually psychologists ... it depends on what you mean by &quot;psychologists.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:29.990" style="s2"> I&#39;m talking a lot about Nietzsche and Dostoevksi, as well as a Russian writer</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2"> Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote a book entitled &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, which is one of the ...</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:42.429" style="s2"> There were a number of important events that brought down the Soviet Union&#39;s totalitarian system,</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.429" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2"> and you can argue which ones they were, but no doubt one of them was Solzhenitsyns</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:20:55.779" style="s2"> publication of &quot;De Gulag Archipel.&quot; That&#39;s a 2700 page book,</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.779" end="00:21:02.860" style="s2"> that describes what it was like to live there, and how many people died.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.860" end="00:21:10.399" style="s2"> It&#39;s a glowing book. He won a Nobel Prize and he deserved it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.399" end="00:21:15.409" style="s2"> Solzhenitsyn, someone remarkable. He is the Dostoevsky of the twentieth century,</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.409" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2"> and that means something. And Dostoevsky is someone else that I use a lot in that part.</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2"> Dostoevsky and Nietzsche essentially saw themselves as psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:28.919" style="s2"> It&#39;s strange because when you think about scientists,</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.919" end="00:21:33.389" style="s2"> you usually think of people doing experiments, right? But one of the things ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.389" end="00:21:37.850" style="s2"> you will notice this when you think about it, for many of you have enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.850" end="00:21:42.570" style="s2"> attended lectures on science. And a lot of what they teach you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.570" end="00:21:47.389" style="s2"> if they teach you scientific research is how to set up a good experiment,</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.389" end="00:21:51.509" style="s2"> with a correct methodology, a correct analysis, how the results</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.509" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2"> structure well in a scientific format, how to test a hypothesis.</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:01.289" style="s2"> But what you never teach them is how you do at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.289" end="00:22:06.500" style="s2"> comes to the hypothesis. Because at least that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.500" end="00:22:11.909" style="s2"> half the problem, and probably more than half.</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.909" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2"> As a scientist, you also have to be able to come up with hypotheses, and not just test them.</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:24.590" style="s2"> You may need both to be a true scientist, but you may not. Maybe you can go alone</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.590" end="00:22:29.740" style="s2"> come up with extraordinary hypotheses, and it is certainly the case that people like Dostoevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.740" end="00:22:33.190" style="s2"> could come up with incredible hypotheses.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.190" end="00:22:38.429" style="s2"> Their ideas are in many ways fundamental to the entire development of thought ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.429" end="00:22:41.830" style="s2"> for the type of thinking you will find in college. Their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.830" end="00:22:47.659" style="s2"> is fundamental to the entire development of both the scientific and the non-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.659" end="00:22:53.429" style="s2"> ideas of the entire twentieth century. So it&#39;s very entertaining to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.429" end="00:22:58.210" style="s2"> to descend into it, and look at the roots of things like this.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.210" end="00:23:02.460" style="s2"> Because that&#39;s how you find out how things are connected, and why, and how they developed,</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.460" end="00:23:07.230" style="s2"> and what that means. What it means when you have those ideas and why you have them</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.230" end="00:23:09.620" style="s2"> and what role they play in your life.</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.620" end="00:23:16.279" style="s2"> Okay, so after that ... that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.279" end="00:23:24.549" style="s2"> the clinical and philosophical part of the course ends. I am a clinical psychologist,</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.549" end="00:23:28.879" style="s2"> and most of the leading personality theorists were clinical psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.879" end="00:23:33.350" style="s2"> That is why the first part of the lecture is philosophical.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:37.259" style="s2"> Because clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.259" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2"> are not really scientists, they are more like engineers.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:49.330" style="s2"> What an engineer wants to do ... an engineer might be using scientific knowledge, fine,</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:53.169" style="s2"> very well. But what he actually wants to do is change something.</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.169" end="00:23:59.379" style="s2"> He wants to make something, he wants to transform something. He wants to act in a way that is useful.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.379" end="00:24:05.249" style="s2"> The same is true for the domain of health.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.249" end="00:24:09.899" style="s2"> Someone comes to you with a psychological problem. What you want to do then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.899" end="00:24:16.379" style="s2"> is to make it better. And &quot;better&quot; is not a scientific category. So if you ...</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.379" end="00:24:20.230" style="s2"> you can say, &quot;It&#39;s scientific because worse means&quot; abnormal. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.230" end="00:24:24.700" style="s2"> That is not true. You can say that, but it is superficial. Because it often happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.700" end="00:24:31.149" style="s2"> that you don&#39;t normally see as healthy. You see extraordinary as healthy.</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.149" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2"> Or you may see extraordinary as desirable, and desirable may be even better than healthy.</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:41.159" style="s2"> You cannot avoid the domain of values ​​when you try to interact with people,</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.159" end="00:24:46.850" style="s2"> and put their lives in order. Because what you always ask is, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:50.789" style="s2"> &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;Why are you dissatisfied?&quot; &quot;Why are you suffering?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.789" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2"> &quot;Why aren&#39;t you productive?&quot; &quot;Why do you compete with everyone?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2"> &quot;Why can&#39;t you sleep?&quot; &quot;Why do you wake up screaming?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2"> &quot;Why can&#39;t you pursue anything that would benefit you?&quot; &quot;Why are you hurting everyone you know?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.419" style="s2"> Those are ethical questions. And then the following problem is:</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.419" end="00:25:12.590" style="s2"> &quot;What are we going to do about it?&quot; &quot;What do you want?&quot; &quot;What would you like your life to be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.590" end="00:25:15.539" style="s2"> if it were up to you? &quot;And then,&quot; How do we get there</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.539" end="00:25:20.129" style="s2"> from where you are now to there? ”And these are all architectural questions,</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.129" end="00:25:25.009" style="s2"> but above all they are ethical questions, because it is about how to act.</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.009" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to leave that unnoticed. Because that usually happens.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:34.309" style="s2"> Doctors, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists (even if they are doctors),</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.309" end="00:25:38.100" style="s2"> they think what they are doing is science, but it is not.</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.100" end="00:25:43.289" style="s2"> They are informed by science, but it is not the same. That certainly applies to doctors,</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.289" end="00:25:46.990" style="s2"> they are not even trained to be scientists.</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.990" end="00:25:54.210" style="s2"> Enough about that. The next part of the lecture, the second half,</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.210" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2"> focuses on two elements of personality theory, more modern elements, although not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:07.669" style="s2"> more valuable. In part, it will be very neurobiological, because we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.669" end="00:26:17.470" style="s2"> have made a lot of progress, over the past hundred years, when it comes to understanding the structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.470" end="00:26:23.980" style="s2"> and brain function. The things we don&#39;t know about the brain ...</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.980" end="00:26:28.749" style="s2"> We don&#39;t understand many things about the brain. For example, we have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.749" end="00:26:34.490" style="s2"> what the relationship is with consciousness, except that the brain is needed.</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.490" end="00:26:39.139" style="s2"> And you can even challenge that somewhat, because there are known cases</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.139" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2"> of people born with hydrocephalus, that means your skull is filling</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2"> with moisture. The most famous case was a Frenchman who got an MRI scan</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:55.519" style="s2"> because of one thing or another (it had nothing to do with what was eventually discovered),</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.519" end="00:27:00.749" style="s2"> but he only had five percent of his cortical brain tissue. His whole head was filled with</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.749" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2"> cerebrospinal fluid, and his brain was a kind of membrane along the sides,</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:08.600" style="s2"> like a balloon. And as far as they could see it, it was nothing wrong with him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.600" end="00:27:12.529" style="s2"> &quot;Hm, interesting. What is the rest of that brain for then?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.529" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2"> And then there&#39;s the matter of ... I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever heard of ...</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:24.169" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember her name, I think it&#39;s Pepper. She had a famous red-tailed parrot.</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.169" end="00:27:30.179" style="s2"> You can look it up: &quot;Talking African Gray Parrot.&quot; And that parrot</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.179" end="00:27:35.190" style="s2"> could talk like a four-year-old. Better than any chimpanzee. Complete sentences,</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.190" end="00:27:40.769" style="s2"> he seemed to understand what he was doing. It&#39;s a parrot, its brain is so big.</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.769" end="00:27:42.419" style="s2"> How is that possible?</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.419" end="00:27:48.360" style="s2"> There are many things we don&#39;t know about the brain. They are incredibly complex.</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.360" end="00:27:53.330" style="s2"> But we have discovered many interesting things.</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.330" end="00:27:59.259" style="s2"> We understand where the fundamental networks for reward, pain and fear are.</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.259" end="00:28:03.610" style="s2"> This is important. As if you were discovering important continents.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:08.450" style="s2"> We understand to some extent how people learn, and under what conditions,</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.450" end="00:28:15.710" style="s2"> and we understand to some extent what the basic motivations and emotions are.</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.710" end="00:28:20.169" style="s2"> Those are not scientific categories, motivations and emotions. Those are linguistic categories.</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.169" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2"> But we have to make do with it. We know quite a bit about their underlying neurobiological basis,</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:30.519" style="s2"> and I want to discuss that in some detail, for several reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.519" end="00:28:36.749" style="s2"> Partly because it provides a nice scientific basis for many of the hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.749" end="00:28:41.529" style="s2"> and assumptions of the psychoanalysts. For example, Freud had the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.529" end="00:28:46.929" style="s2"> of the existence of the id. There&#39;s no id in your brain, but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.929" end="00:28:51.509" style="s2"> because the id, the idea of ​​the id, is a functional category, an instrument as it were.</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.509" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2"> But there are many &quot;id-like&quot; structures in your brain, such as in particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.220" end="00:29:00.269" style="s2"> the hypothalamus, and that thing ... People like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.269" end="00:29:05.330" style="s2"> their impressive cortex is what controls everything, but your hypothalamus,</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.330" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2"> a very little thing above your spinal cord,</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:15.889" style="s2"> that&#39;s what&#39;s in charge. As long as you&#39;re not hungry or angry or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.889" end="00:29:21.389" style="s2"> chasing sexual arousal, you don&#39;t gamble and you&#39;re not addicted as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.389" end="00:29:27.889" style="s2"> are fully fed, and feel warm and comfortable, you can think, and you are in control.</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.889" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2"> But as soon as any of that goes wrong, the subcortical systems take over.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2"> You can see that in conditions such as anorexia.</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:41.090" style="s2"> You can think of anorexia as a war between the cortex and the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.090" end="00:29:47.570" style="s2"> The cortex only wins if the anorexic patient dies.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.570" end="00:29:50.970" style="s2"> Beyond that, it&#39;s the hypothalamus that always wins, and that&#39;s why anorexic patients</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.970" end="00:29:55.779" style="s2"> can&#39;t control their binge eating. They lose weight to their weight</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.779" end="00:30:00.779" style="s2"> 75 percent is what it should be, which is difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.779" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy to starve yourself like that. But they keep having binges</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:09.960" style="s2"> and eat three liters of ice cream, and two sacks of bread. And they can&#39;t stop themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.960" end="00:30:13.179" style="s2"> because your hypothalamus would rather not have you dead.</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.179" end="00:30:17.860" style="s2"> So if you&#39;re not paying attention, if you&#39;re not in shape, or if you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.860" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2"> recently been hurt, giving your energy, or the negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:27.940" style="s2"> emotion has disturbed your cognitive abilities, the hypothalamus will kick in,</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.940" end="00:30:32.029" style="s2"> grab you and say &quot;you&#39;re hungry&quot; and off you go, to the fridge.</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.029" end="00:30:35.929" style="s2"> At two in the morning you will empty that fridge in a kind of daze.</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.929" end="00:30:38.409" style="s2"> And then you come to your senses, and you think, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.409" end="00:30:43.820" style="s2"> That&#39;s the id, and that&#39;s not a trivial thing.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.820" end="00:30:48.429" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a good thing, because if he wasn&#39;t constantly telling you what to do ...</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.429" end="00:30:53.129" style="s2"> think about how silly you are. If you had to breathe voluntarily, how many days do you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.129" end="00:30:57.269" style="s2"> you would survive? You wake up and an hour later you forget to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.269" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2"> and then you&#39;re dead. Your brain won&#39;t let you do anything important</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2"> they all take care of that in the background, because you&#39;re just not smart enough.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:12.269" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know how to digest things, for example. In fact you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.269" end="00:31:18.470" style="s2"> how you walk, even if you do. There are fundamental subsystems, and some are not even aware,</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.470" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2"> strangely, although they are neurological, and they do all the work.</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.489" style="s2"> And your cortex rides, in a way.</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.489" end="00:31:31.239" style="s2"> And he thinks he&#39;s in control, but no, not really.</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.239" end="00:31:35.720" style="s2"> We are going to spend quite a bit of time on the basic brain structures,</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.720" end="00:31:40.139" style="s2"> and the functions of those structures, because I love functional neuroanatomy.</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.139" end="00:31:43.399" style="s2"> Not only do I want to know what the brain consists of, but I also want to know what the parts do.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.399" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2"> There we have difficult reading. Swanson, that&#39;s a hard part</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:56.460" style="s2"> and Gray&#39;s piece. Those papers were written by genius neuropsychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:32:00.669" style="s2"> They have put their entire life&#39;s work in a paper.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.669" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2"> You will read it and think, &quot;Oops, this is difficult.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:08.529" style="s2"> Yes, it took a genius thirty years to write it, so it will be difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.529" end="00:32:13.809" style="s2"> But it&#39;s so informative, it&#39;s worth it, if you want to take on that struggle.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.809" end="00:32:15.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:15.100" end="00:32:20.239" style="s2"> That&#39;s the biological side, then there is the psychometric side. And psychometrics is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.239" end="00:32:24.119" style="s2"> a very unpopular domain within psychology, even among psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.119" end="00:32:30.269" style="s2"> That&#39;s because psychometricians have actually discovered things, and people hate them</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.269" end="00:32:34.999" style="s2"> what they discovered. And no wonder. They were psychometricians, engineers in fact,</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.999" end="00:32:41.539" style="s2"> who became involved in psychology and discovered intelligence. Technical, psychometric intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.539" end="00:32:46.279" style="s2"> I.Q. People will tell you that there are many types of intelligence. That is not true.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.279" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2"> That is incorrect. Because of the following: the statistics that psychologists use,</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:58.210" style="s2"> were invented by the people who discovered IQ. That means all that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.210" end="00:33:03.590" style="s2"> what psychologists have ever claimed, and that has been statistically verified,</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.590" end="00:33:09.289" style="s2"> verified in the same way as IQ. So you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.289" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2"> &quot;IQ is invalid,&quot; without saying that all psychology, as well as other domains,</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.220" end="00:33:17.159" style="s2"> are also invalid because they use the same method.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.159" end="00:33:22.340" style="s2"> And it&#39;s worse because the relationship between IQ and success is much stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.340" end="00:33:27.720" style="s2"> the relationship between almost all psychological phenomena and whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.720" end="00:33:34.549" style="s2"> For example with you, even though you are all very above average intelligent,</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.549" end="00:33:38.460" style="s2"> because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be here, at least above 85 percent ...</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.460" end="00:33:41.249" style="s2"> That&#39;s something to think about, because much of it is biologically determined,</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.249" end="00:33:44.149" style="s2"> so for a large part you are here</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.149" end="00:33:49.669" style="s2"> because you won the genetic lottery. Hooray for you. And nobody has it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.669" end="00:33:55.009" style="s2"> spoiled too much during your upbringing. But even with you is the correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.009" end="00:34:00.039" style="s2"> your intelligence and your average grade are quite high, even if it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.039" end="00:34:03.730" style="s2"> a limited sample, because you are all pretty smart. And even though there are many errors in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.730" end="00:34:09.210" style="s2"> the rating system, because it not only measures intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.210" end="00:34:16.309" style="s2"> even then it is quite strong. When you measure conscientiousness and other elements</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.309" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2"> of personality, what you can do statistically, will be ten percent of people in twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:25.690" style="s2"> in this room with the highest IQ, have the highest income, almost certainly.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2"> Unless something terrible happens to them. You can overcome that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:34.419" style="s2"> to some extent, if you work very hard. That is conscientiousness.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.419" end="00:34:38.510" style="s2"> But that is also a characteristic that seems to have a rather strong biological basis.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.510" end="00:34:43.139" style="s2"> Because of those things people hate psychometricians,</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.139" end="00:34:48.869" style="s2"> for they discover facts, facts that are very unpleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.869" end="00:34:55.809" style="s2"> I can give an example. You all have an IQ above 115.</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.809" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2"> 100 is as smart as an average high school graduate.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:09.349" style="s2"> 115 is the lower limit to get by at a good university, as it were. With 115 you still will</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.349" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2"> have enough hassle, you will have to work hard.</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:20.950" style="s2"> Well, 115 is a standard deviation above the mean. A standard deviation below</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.950" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2"> the average is 85. There are just as many people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:32.030" style="s2"> who have an IQ of 85 as people who can go to college. Then you think:</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.030" end="00:35:38.869" style="s2"> &quot;What can you do with an IQ of 85?&quot; This is an answer ... the United States military</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.869" end="00:35:43.220" style="s2"> has conducted psychometric testing for over a hundred years, for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.220" end="00:35:48.260" style="s2"> but they have done a lot of basic science. The army of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.260" end="00:35:53.410" style="s2"> the United States likes to have recruits. Understandable, because would you be anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.410" end="00:35:57.400" style="s2"> Want to be sent to be shot? Probably not.</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.400" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2"> People don&#39;t line up for the military. Even outside of wartime</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.950" end="00:36:07.510" style="s2"> it&#39;s hard to get people. The Americans have used the military ...</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.510" end="00:36:12.460" style="s2"> imagine having an underclass, of people who are not doing very well, what you have in every society,</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.460" end="00:36:16.780" style="s2"> and you want to raise some of them into some sort of middle class.</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.780" end="00:36:21.329" style="s2"> You can do that quite effectively by enlisting young men into the army,</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.329" end="00:36:25.020" style="s2"> where they get training, and discipline, and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.020" end="00:36:29.069" style="s2"> they can rise to the middle class. So there are many policy reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.069" end="00:36:35.410" style="s2"> 1) why the US military wants people, and 2) to serve in the military,</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.410" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2"> but also for social reasons. Positive social reasons. So the chances are slim</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:48.049" style="s2"> that they refuse you. One hundred years of IQ testing was the result of the introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.049" end="00:36:52.770" style="s2"> a law in the United States: you cannot enlist someone in the military</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.770" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2"> if he has an IQ of less than 82. That&#39;s 10 percent of the population.</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:06.030" style="s2"> Think about that. That means that one in ten people is unable to contribute something of value,</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.030" end="00:37:12.349" style="s2"> in an organization that is complex, but no more complex than other organizations,</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.349" end="00:37:18.619" style="s2"> who is desperately looking for people. They cannot offer anything that makes a positive contribution.</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.619" end="00:37:23.270" style="s2"> The military is worse off with them than without them.</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.270" end="00:37:29.569" style="s2"> It&#39;s a terrible thing to say so, but it&#39;s a terrible statistic. But it also means ...</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.569" end="00:37:33.990" style="s2"> if you see the military as more or less similar to the world in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.990" end="00:37:38.579" style="s2"> in terms of complexity, that means there is 10 percent of the population</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.579" end="00:37:44.490" style="s2"> who cannot really live well in a complex cognitive society. And you might say:</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.490" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2"> &quot;Something needs to be done about that.&quot; Yes, good luck.</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:51.180" style="s2"> People have been trying to do something about it for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.180" end="00:37:57.640" style="s2"> Billions, maybe even trillions of dollars have been spent trying to achieve cognitive enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.640" end="00:38:00.460" style="s2"> in the United States. Besides the fact that we have an education system,</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.460" end="00:38:04.950" style="s2"> with the aim of making people smarter.</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.950" end="00:38:10.250" style="s2"> We will talk a lot about psychometrics, and the psychometricians</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.250" end="00:38:14.930" style="s2"> are in fact merciless statisticians. In a way they are a-theoretical.</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.930" end="00:38:20.089" style="s2"> They use the computer and advanced statistical techniques,</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.089" end="00:38:24.890" style="s2"> to view large collections of data and to distil patterns from them. I hated the &quot;Big Five&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.890" end="00:38:28.309" style="s2"> when I first came across it. I thought, &quot;My God, how boring.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.309" end="00:38:33.640" style="s2"> It has no underlying theory, it is not prescriptive, it is not interesting in a literary way,</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.640" end="00:38:40.510" style="s2"> it doesn&#39;t have a good story, it&#39;s so dry.</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.510" end="00:38:49.319" style="s2"> But it works, and that&#39;s the way it is. So we are going to spend a lot of time on psychometrics.</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.319" end="00:38:53.690" style="s2"> And my lab has done quite a bit of work over the past ten years to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.690" end="00:38:58.690" style="s2"> further develop the Big Five model. What we will discuss, among other things, is the &quot;Big Ten&quot; model,</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.690" end="00:39:03.369" style="s2"> and that divides each of the five characteristics into two aspects, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.369" end="00:39:07.549" style="s2"> Those are quite interesting. They predict political beliefs quite well.</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.549" end="00:39:12.970" style="s2"> Conservatives tend to be more orderly, which is part of conscientiousness,</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.970" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2"> and less creative, less open. And progressives tend to be more open and less conscientious.</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:22.380" style="s2"> A cynic would say, &quot;That&#39;s why they support income leveling, because they don&#39;t work.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.380" end="00:39:26.750" style="s2"> Conservatives work like crazy, and the progressives say:</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.750" end="00:39:30.260" style="s2"> &quot;Give me some of that money&quot; and &quot;The system is unfair.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.260" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2"> And the conservatives say, &quot;No, we&#39;ve worked hard, and we&#39;re not giving you anything.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2"> They both have flawed theories. Progressives, by the way, are good entrepreneurs.</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:47.049" style="s2"> Wait, let me rephrase that. Most entrepreneurs are politically progressive,</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.049" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2"> because they score high on openness. It seems to be that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2"> progressive people start businesses, and conservative people lead businesses. So they need each other.</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.520" end="00:40:00.770" style="s2"> Since progressives are open, they are already working on the next idea.</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.770" end="00:40:04.339" style="s2"> They don&#39;t want to bother with the details, they find that soporific.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.339" end="00:40:08.289" style="s2"> They are not very orderly. But once you set up a process,</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.289" end="00:40:12.089" style="s2"> and it works, you need someone to keep it functioning.</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.089" end="00:40:15.380" style="s2"> That is not interesting if you have a creative personality.</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.380" end="00:40:29.910" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s it. That&#39;s the college. How much time do we have?</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.910" end="00:40:33.980" style="s2"> I think I&#39;m gonna tell you a story now</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.980" end="00:40:39.420" style="s2"> and you will think it has nothing to do with what we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.420" end="00:40:49.740" style="s2"> but that does not matter. I&#39;ve picked out this strange picture.</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.740" end="00:40:58.890" style="s2"> It is a picture of Jonas, a biblical figure. That story is 2,500 years old, so it&#39;s quite an old story.</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.890" end="00:41:03.430" style="s2"> And usually when a story is 2,500 years old, it is much older than that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.430" end="00:41:08.030" style="s2"> It happened to be written down 2,500 years ago, but at that time</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.030" end="00:41:12.440" style="s2"> there were no novels and books, you didn&#39;t have fifty different stories at your fingertips.</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.440" end="00:41:16.579" style="s2"> There were a few stories that everyone knew, and who knows how long they had been around</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.579" end="00:41:21.970" style="s2"> but that was a very long time. So it was written 2,500 years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.970" end="00:41:28.309" style="s2"> but we actually have no idea how old it is. In a way it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.309" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2"> almost immeasurably old, at least by human understanding. You see this image, and what you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:40.230" style="s2"> is this thing ... what would you call it? It&#39;s a medieval version of a whale.</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.230" end="00:41:43.010" style="s2"> And you might think, &quot;That&#39;s not what a whale looks like,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.010" end="00:41:48.119" style="s2"> and that&#39;s true in a sense, but a medieval whale was not</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.119" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2"> what we mean by whale. Whale in the Middle Ages meant &quot;big, terrifying, underwater case.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:59.609" style="s2"> Maybe a huge squid was a &quot;whale,&quot; a whale was a &quot;whale,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.609" end="00:42:04.900" style="s2"> a shark was a &quot;whale,&quot; the category is different.</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.900" end="00:42:11.579" style="s2"> Because of this, and because of ignorance, the mythological representation looks so strange.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.579" end="00:42:16.220" style="s2"> It&#39;s still a representation of something, but it&#39;s a bit generalized.</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.220" end="00:42:22.859" style="s2"> He spits out Jonas on dry land. And you think, &quot;That&#39;s kind of strange.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.859" end="00:42:23.750" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:23.750" end="00:42:29.339" style="s2"> How many of you have seen Pinocchio? Pretty much. How many not?</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.339" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2"> Really? You haven&#39;t seen Pinocchio? What kind of parents did you have !?</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.500" end="00:42:34.619" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:34.619" end="00:42:39.589" style="s2"> You remember that in Pinocchio, Pinocchio&#39;s father is locked up in a whale.</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.589" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2"> And Pinocchio has to go into the depths to save him. And what you did not notice</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:48.760" style="s2"> when you watched Pinocchio is how strange that is. You&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.760" end="00:42:55.010" style="s2"> to a doll that descends into the sea to rescue its father from a whale.</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.010" end="00:42:58.270" style="s2"> And you think, &quot;Yeah, logically.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.270" end="00:42:59.049" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:59.049" end="00:43:03.010" style="s2"> That is interesting. Why does that make sense?</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.010" end="00:43:11.220" style="s2"> Why does that make sense? Because it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.220" end="00:43:16.500" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good example of the power of an archetypal idea. Because an archetypal idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.500" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2"> is a very deep and old idea, which you find understandable, even if someone points it out to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:25.369" style="s2"> that you believe that, what you do when you watch a movie, you think:</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.369" end="00:43:29.230" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s weird that I believe that.&quot; And that&#39;s not doll</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.230" end="00:43:34.339" style="s2"> who descends into the sea to rescue his father from a whale. So that you know.</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.339" end="00:43:38.289" style="s2"> It is a drawing of a doll descending into the sea to save his father</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.289" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2"> from a whale. It is outside of reality in many ways. But what&#39;s interesting,</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:49.170" style="s2"> is that if you go to the movies to watch something like that, and someone taps your shoulder,</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.170" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2"> and say, &quot;Do you know what you&#39;re doing?&quot; then you say, &quot;Shut up,</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2"> and let me watch the movie. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:54.619" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:54.619" end="00:43:58.200" style="s2"> You don&#39;t notice, &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;m very odd. It&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.200" end="00:44:02.710" style="s2"> how I&#39;m watching this, not noticing how peculiar I am. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.710" end="00:44:10.010" style="s2"> That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to tell you this story, because it&#39;s true, even though</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.010" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2"> is it not true.</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:17.869" style="s2"> That is a strange thing. I had a very strange professor at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.869" end="00:44:21.970" style="s2"> He died a few years ago. He took a bus I think in Winnipeg</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.970" end="00:44:27.720" style="s2"> and he never got out again, and no one ever saw him again. He had been a prison psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.720" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2"> He worked in a very high-security prison and at the University of Alberta. So who knows ...</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:37.539" style="s2"> maybe he ran into one of his old clients. But it is very strange, a strange ending.</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.539" end="00:44:44.890" style="s2"> We talked about fiction, and he said:</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.890" end="00:44:49.260" style="s2"> &quot;Fiction is a lie that can tell you the truth.&quot; That&#39;s an interesting way of seeing it.</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.260" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2"> Because you read fiction, and it is true. But that&#39;s not it,</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:45:00.530" style="s2"> because it is not about something that actually happened.</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.530" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2"> But it is more than that because if it is good fiction it is about a collection of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:10.030" style="s2"> that have taken place in a similar way. It&#39;s a distillation. Like when someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.030" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2"> you tell a long story, and you talk about it with your partner and he asks:</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:18.730" style="s2"> &quot;What was that about?&quot; And you tell in two sentences what it was about.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.730" end="00:45:24.780" style="s2"> You bring it back to the core. And a very good story is at the heart of something.</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.780" end="00:45:29.930" style="s2"> And some of the very old stories, the very strange ones like Jonah and the whale for example,</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.930" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2"> told in a certain way in the story of Pinocchio, are at the heart of many things,</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:41.180" style="s2"> and people have distilled those stories for a very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.180" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2"> Thousands of people for thousands of years,</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:52.730" style="s2"> that tell these strange stories, that people remember. And people think, &quot;They are true.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.730" end="00:45:55.460" style="s2"> Yes, they are true, but not in the way of a science story</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.460" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2"> where is. It&#39;s a different type of &quot;true.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:06.569" style="s2"> This is the story of Jonas. It&#39;s an old Jewish story. It probably also says</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.569" end="00:46:13.430" style="s2"> a variant of the Quran, but I don&#39;t know it, and maybe there isn&#39;t one.</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.430" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2"> Jonas lives in 500 BC. and God says to him:</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:26.650" style="s2"> “Jonas, there is a city called Nineveh, and the people do not walk there</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.650" end="00:46:31.089" style="s2"> the right way, and things will soon go all wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.089" end="00:46:34.510" style="s2"> if no one does anything about it. So I think you should go to Nineveh</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.510" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2"> and tell the king and the people,</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:42.520" style="s2"> that they don&#39;t live well. ”And Jonas, with his good mind, says:</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.520" end="00:46:47.980" style="s2"> &quot;You want me to go to a city and the king, such an authoritarian figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.980" end="00:46:51.500" style="s2"> with absolute power over everything, tell that there is something wrong with what he does,</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.500" end="00:46:55.930" style="s2"> and that all his subjects are evil? You want me to do that? ”And Jonas says:</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.930" end="00:47:01.420" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; because he&#39;s a smart guy. So he runs away</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.420" end="00:47:06.990" style="s2"> and goes to a village, and he goes on a boat,</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.990" end="00:47:10.030" style="s2"> a large boat with fishermen. And they will take him to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.030" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2"> God can&#39;t find him, which isn&#39;t easy. But of course God cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2"> be fooled by such pitiful strategies, as he is omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:20.380" style="s2"> and things like that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.380" end="00:47:24.200" style="s2"> Jonas is on the water, with the fishermen,</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.200" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2"> and God is calling a great storm. And the fishermen panic because</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2"> the boat will capsize and they will all perish, and they are not happy about that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:36.799" style="s2"> So they decide to throw everything overboard, so that the boat becomes lighter.</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.799" end="00:47:40.309" style="s2"> But that does not help, because the storm is getting worse. And then they all start to pray.</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.309" end="00:47:44.339" style="s2"> They all have different gods, it is a small god competition.</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.339" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2"> One fisherman prays to one god, and the other fisherman prays to another god, but nothing happens.</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.970" style="s2"> Jonas happens to be sleeping in the ship&#39;s hold. He has already told you that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.970" end="00:47:58.170" style="s2"> he&#39;s on the run from his god, so they think, &quot;Let&#39;s wake up Jonas,</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.170" end="00:48:01.609" style="s2"> because maybe he&#39;s responsible for these troubles. ”So they go down,</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.609" end="00:48:06.410" style="s2"> wake him up and ask for his god. And he says:</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.410" end="00:48:10.569" style="s2"> &quot;My God made the heavens and the earth.&quot; And their gods didn&#39;t do so much spectacular,</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.569" end="00:48:13.420" style="s2"> so they were quite upset. They say to Jonas:</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.420" end="00:48:17.619" style="s2"> &quot;Why are you running from that figure? That&#39;s not a good idea.&quot; And Jonas says:</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.619" end="00:48:20.700" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s my fault that this storm has come,</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.700" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2"> So throw me overboard. &quot;And they say,&quot; We can&#39;t do that,</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.829" style="s2"> you shouldn&#39;t run but you&#39;re not a murderer or anything</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.829" end="00:48:33.250" style="s2"> we can&#39;t just throw you overboard. ”So they&#39;re trying to get to shore, but God won&#39;t allow that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.250" end="00:48:37.750" style="s2"> He intensifies the storm until the fishermen finally say:</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.750" end="00:48:42.170" style="s2"> &quot;You know what? There you go!&quot; And that&#39;s no problem for Jonas, because he knows he is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.170" end="00:48:47.950" style="s2"> is a bad guy. And a whale swallows him. Then you think: &quot;That probably isn&#39;t right.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.950" end="00:48:51.890" style="s2"> First, if a whale swallowed you, you&#39;d be dead. ”And it was probably a shark.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.890" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2"> You won&#39;t thrive there.</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2"> It is not a big cave, like in the whale in Pinocchio. It&#39;s dense and there&#39;s no oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:05.940" style="s2"> so you&#39;re dead. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. Jonas is in the whale,</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.940" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2"> he&#39;s kind of upset, because he&#39;s in a whale, in a storm, and God is mad at him.</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.309" style="s2"> So the first thing he does is pray and tell God he&#39;s an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.309" end="00:49:17.289" style="s2"> and that he would like to be forgiven. Then the whale swims to shore and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.289" end="00:49:23.940" style="s2"> spits him out on the beach, a very inelegant way to arrive.</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.940" end="00:49:25.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:49:25.240" end="00:49:30.829" style="s2"> So that&#39;s Jonas&#39;s story. And then he gets up and thinks:</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.829" end="00:49:34.490" style="s2"> &quot;Yeah, that wasn&#39;t that good. It was pretty bad.</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.490" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2"> Maybe I&#39;ll just go to Nineveh and tell those people that they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:42.690" style="s2"> don&#39;t live well, because that is better than making God angry.</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.690" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2"> Because of the storm, the fishermen, and the whale, and all that. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.130" style="s2"> And he goes to Nineveh, tells them what&#39;s going on, and it seems to work.</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.130" end="00:49:55.640" style="s2"> That&#39;s an interesting story, and you think, &quot;How could people</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.640" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2"> believe that? ”You might ask,“ Do you believe that story? ”</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:06.119" style="s2"> And you think, &quot;No,&quot; but then you think, &quot;Maybe that&#39;s a more complex question</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.119" end="00:50:10.289" style="s2"> than you might think, because it turned out that I believed the story about Pinocchio. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.289" end="00:50:13.770" style="s2"> And you say, &quot;No, I didn&#39;t really believe it.&quot; Then I would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.770" end="00:50:19.089" style="s2"> &quot;It depends what you mean by &#39;believe.&#39;&quot; Cause you looked at it,</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.089" end="00:50:22.670" style="s2"> and as you watched it grabbed you, you understood, you didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.670" end="00:50:28.099" style="s2"> be disturbed, you followed it. So did you believe it? No, you were one</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.099" end="00:50:32.440" style="s2"> four-year-old skeptic, who thought, &quot;Pop, whale ... no, that&#39;s not right.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.440" end="00:50:36.750" style="s2"> You are not like that, you believe in it, because you are gripped by it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.750" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2"> And if someone taps your shoulder and wakes you up thirty or twenty years later</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.920" style="s2"> then you say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t believe that.&quot; Do you know,</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.920" end="00:50:46.359" style="s2"> it is remarkable what you all believe.</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.359" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2"> How many of you are fans of Star Wars? You dare not admit it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:52.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:52.460" end="00:50:52.910" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:52.910" end="00:50:57.809" style="s2"> But it must be many. I know that. That&#39;s all mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.809" end="00:51:02.569" style="s2"> It&#39;s all mythology. You know that the person who ... what&#39;s his name?</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.569" end="00:51:07.900" style="s2"> The man who invented Star Wars, Lucas. Lucas was a student of Joseph Campbell.</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.900" end="00:51:14.470" style="s2"> Joseph Campbell was a psychologist / mythologist, and the Star Wars stories are modern mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.470" end="00:51:18.309" style="s2"> Just like Harry Potter, and everything else that fires the imagination.</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.309" end="00:51:24.750" style="s2"> You bet you believe it. And with good reason. What time is it?</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.750" end="00:51:28.730" style="s2"> We stop here. I&#39;ll tell you the reason next time we see each other.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.730" end="00:51:29.230" style="s2"></p>
