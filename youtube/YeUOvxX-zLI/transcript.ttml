<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">get into the conversation that way and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">we will be looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">in order to see what might be visible</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">all right the democracy ai tool</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">is going to be used for one question up</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">front and then it&#39;s going to be more or</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">less quiet for the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">hour of discussion we will use it in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">second part of the discussion in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">source information from you all</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">so the question that we would like you</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">to answer is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">can you identify and tell us about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">moment at which</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">you realized that drastic action of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">the sort that unity 2020 represents</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">might be necessary</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">in order to rescue the republic</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">so uh while you are answering that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">question if you&#39;re logged into democracy</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">ai let me tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">unity 2020 for that fraction of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">audience that knows nothing about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">and then tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">what campfire means and why we chose</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">that as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">unity 2020 is a plan to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">recapture the white house on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">the american public</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">in short we plan to draft two candidates</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">one from the left and one from the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">under the agreement that they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">govern as a team and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">make decisions by consensus</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">uh the person who runs at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.599" style="s2">ticket will be chosen</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">by a coin flip after four years the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.599" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">positions would reverse and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">president would run in the vice</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">presidential spot and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">and this would go on until one party had</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">inhabited the office of president twice</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">and was therefore ineligible for another</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">at which point someone else would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">drafted into their spot</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">or until the american public saw fit to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">do something else</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s the basic plan it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">designed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">avoid the danger of spoiling the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">by having a consensus government of left</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">and right</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">this will tend to drain both the major</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">parties of power rather than empower one</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">and disempower the other the reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve chosen campfire as a metaphor to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">discuss this is that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">long faced difficult problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">did not have the solution for</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">during the day people would typically be</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">out hunting gathering</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">farming and at night as their eyes were</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">no longer so useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">uh out and about they would gather</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">the campfire or the hearth and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">would talk to each other about what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">problems they faced and what solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">might be available to them and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">bringing together of different minds</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">different experience different expertise</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">that has allowed human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">to conquer so many niches</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">all right now without further ado let me</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">introduce our guest</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">ask you both if there&#39;s a moment at</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">which you realized that the standard</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">handed in our democracy might not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">to uh to steer our course this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">roughly the question we&#39;ve asked others</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">to answer and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">curious whether you each can identify a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">moment in your past when</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">when that became clear to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">huh so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">question when did we uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">when did i have the sense that something</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">was broken in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">politics i mean for me it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">because i i feel like i can go all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">way back</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">to my childhood in the 1990s and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">i can remember even at that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">people saying washington is broken just</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">look at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">impeachment uh situation like the effort</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">to impeach bill clinton back during the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">monica lewinsky uh scandal and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">remember at that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">people sort of lamenting the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">communication between the parties and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">between the american people even</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">had started to decline in some uh some</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">radical way and you were seeing that</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">think that that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">true back then but you know those are</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">still like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">those are the good old days looking back</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">at it from now in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to get along and reason</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">inkling even back then</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">as a kid that something was uh souring</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">a little bit and that feeling has only</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">grown over the course of really my</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">observing politics and you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve done it for a while now</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">that&#39;s a great answer when we come back</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.199" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">to the discussion i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">this sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">um that it has only gotten clearer over</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">time i think it&#39;s an important one</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">but uh nate do you uh have a moment you</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">um and my i guess the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">attention i&#39;ve paid to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">the system itself and and democracy as</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">yet because we go through stuff together</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">challenging stuff and i&#39;m not comparing</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">going to war to playing a sport but</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">sacrifice that has to go into that as</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">well to be a lead just a different type</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">so when uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">and we rise above all our differences</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">when it&#39;s time to play the game when</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;s time to go to battle</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">we fight for one another the man on our</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">left and right woman on our left and</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">and we would do anything for them we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">would take a bullet for them</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t even always like them or agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">with everything that they say and think</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">and believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">but we know they would do the same for</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">us and that is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">dramatically uh lost in our country</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">uh you know as far as</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">guests that love for one another and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">acceptance of differences and still</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">be able to work together so when i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">seeing when i was seeing this happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">with the election and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">when colin started sitting on the bench</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">in protest and it became</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">widely politicized um and it became</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">a once again an</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">act or a situation that was taken both</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">the democratic party and the republican</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">party and used as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">um to prove their point to prove why you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">know why</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">they are the more righteous party or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">better party</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">and then you know we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">obviously more recently with kovid and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">whatever it is it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">everything is politicized and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">is it it&#39;s going to be taken to the left</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">take it to the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">strong opinions about it so what my</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">real understanding of how broken things</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">were and how disgusting things were in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">where was through that situation because</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">i i wrote calling an open letter i ended</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">up meeting with him and it was through</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">our conversation which was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">open-minded one from both of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">we didn&#39;t agree on a lot um but we</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">listened to one another is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">that&#39;s where the decision for him to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">take a knee alongside his teammates</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">versus sitting on the bench isolated</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">came from</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">um and i thought that was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">powerful i thought that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">a good example of maybe how government</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">in some way should work</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">um when we have these situations like</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">compromises are made but everyone still</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">feels empowered and like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">they have a part in this so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">long-winded answer to your question but</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">i think it lays a bit of background and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">for me it&#39;s really just been the last</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">four years that i&#39;ve even really been</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">paying attention which</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">is kind of embarrassing but everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">happens on our own time i guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">fascinating answer for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">we have a lot of political dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">in this country but</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">for folks in the military when decisions</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">get politicized</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">it results in people you know dying</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">and so it really raises the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">interesting that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">awakening occurred after your service if</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">i understand your answer correctly</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">so i want to actually put these two</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">answers together though because</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">there&#39;s something quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">resonant for me and what you said nate</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">politicization of everything and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">really is this this is the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">is to politicize things where in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">the american public has an interest and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not being served because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">parties are</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">busy catering to special interests that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">fuel them</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">and what they have us doing instead</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">is fighting over symbolism which is both</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">a distraction from what&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">very destructive but if we then look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">what john said</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">john said that um the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">how off things were was clear back in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">the uh the clinton administration which</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">i agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">i think in some ways that&#39;s where part</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">of this really began</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">but that it has only gotten worse over</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.920" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">time and that even the dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">around the clinton years looks uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">tame at this point and so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">constantly facing uh is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">suggestion unity 2020 is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">really good idea but we can&#39;t do it now</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re facing is too important</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">and really the important recognition is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.760" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">the one that john made which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">it only gets worse because it only gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">worse as bad as you think this is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">an argument to do it now rather than to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">because doing it under even worse</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">circumstances and many people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">believe that&#39;s possible but</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">boy is it um that will be even harder</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">yep yeah i mean if i can just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">throw something something on to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">first of all um</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">mate i appreciate um i appreciate your</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">about what it is like of course to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">serve the military but also what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">like to play on a team and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">that sense of common purpose</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">it allows us to bridge divides in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">name of a shared interest right</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">in the name of the fact that there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">something in common that we are striving</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">towards even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">coming from different places and uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">brett uh to tie that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">unity 2020 here really quickly you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">the thing that excites me about</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">um what it is your what it is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">doing here is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">i see it as being about more</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">than just you know whatever candidates</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">be able to get involved and rally around</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">it obviously has to do with the need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">shift um you know the status quo in dc</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">folks believe in that strongly um but</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">it but you couldn&#39;t have excitement</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">building around an alternative way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">engaging</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">an election in this context unless you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">also have movement towards an</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">alternative way of just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">kind of animating our civic culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">really right how is it that we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">each other as human beings in america</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">i think we want to see political</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">movements that are based in this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">human beings on different sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">spectrum and so nate you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">you humanize you know kaepernick&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">um political demonstration i i get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">sense that maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">agree entirely with the way cap analyzes</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">things right</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">but you do what i consider to be the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">patriotic thing what we call patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">empathy</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">at braver angels which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">showing your love for your country by</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">extending understanding to your fellow</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">and so the thing that was inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">about say andrew yang&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">campaign for instance is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">you know he was running with sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">left-wing policy agenda he was saying a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">lot of things that me as a more</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">conservative-minded individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">i&#39;m a bit skeptical of but what came</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">through loud and clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">in yang&#39;s campaign just for instance was</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">this recognition of the basic dignity of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">folks who exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">across the spectrum not just regardless</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">of race but regardless of partisan</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">and philosophy and so forth and so it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">seems to me that unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">springs from that kind of need for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">shift in the culture and the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">our politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">as much as it springs from a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">kind of sort of shift the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">engaging the mechanisms of politics and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">i think that you need both if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:57.279" style="s2">going to usher usher for the type of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">change that we want to see in political</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.279" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">society today</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">so yeah i mean i i agree i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">you know how binary we are right now as</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">a people as</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">a country as americans uh or at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">how we sing how binary are we seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">um is is what hurts the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">because you know we&#39;ve lost our</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">individualism</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t feel as though we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">speak our minds</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">because we&#39;re because we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">being judged and attacked</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">um no matter what you stay and stand for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">you just get attacked you just get</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">attacked there&#39;s just so much anger and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">hatred</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">and like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t feel it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">fun like</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">no one wants to live in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">world where we&#39;re walking on eggshells</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">constantly no one wants to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">what it&#39;s turning into</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s uh we we tell our</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">you know that money doesn&#39;t buy you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">happiness don&#39;t judge people</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">you know never never there&#39;s a book by</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">its cover whatever it is we tell</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">we tell them this these things but we</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">don&#39;t live them we don&#39;t believe them</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">you know and uh and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">everybody but that&#39;s the voices we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">hearing</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">that&#39;s who&#39;s getting the microphone</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">right now and so it seems like probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">a lot more people than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">there was this sign that i used to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">when i was in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">elementary school i think my one of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">teachers or maybe my principal had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">sign</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">up in her office that said everything i</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">ever needed to know i learned in</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">kindergarten</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">and being pretty close to kindergarten</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">at the time back then i sort of thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no way that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">otherwise why not let me leave school</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">now i&#39;m in the second grade i should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">done with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">but as an adult you come to see what</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">that means the things that we teach our</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">are the the values and the virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">the lessons that are most</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">important to sort of formulating</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">character right and showing them</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">how to treat other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">if you want to be treated a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s just that&#39;s sort of just the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">starting point of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">in in life from a certain vantage point</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">and yet it is precisely that basic sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">of thing you know the components of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">interpersonal decency applied to civic</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">and social life</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">right that we&#39;ve lost everybody is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">smart everybody has so much information</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">we have so many facts and figures</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">available to us at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">in our phones and our our and our</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">keyboards and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost a lot of that basic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">um the interplay of of decency and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">dignity as being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">backdrop to a society that works and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">yeah man i feel like we need to get back</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">to things that are fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">i think we also you know i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">implicit in what you both have</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">said but there is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">joy and intrigue in meeting people</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">who aren&#39;t like you people with whom you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">know that you disagree about</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">important things but discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">they are very human and very relatable</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">sometimes surprisingly so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve gotten to is a phase in</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">national dialogue in which the basis to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">discover that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">is being stamped out in other words all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">of the middle ground positions</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">are being declared criminal such that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">you can only inhabit these caricatures</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">at the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">and what it what it does is it really</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">dehumanizes others in each of our eyes</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">and it makes it you know i think people</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">are just walking around</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">with suspicion of each other that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">frankly i don&#39;t think characterized us</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">even you know a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">you you could meet somebody and there</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">was awareness that you wouldn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">but that did not make them uh inhuman to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">you and now</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">um the slightest hint that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">might be skeptical of some position</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">that you&#39;re certain of is enough to tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">you they are the enemy and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">you know not only are they mistaken but</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">that they&#39;re really up to no good</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">and this you know it&#39;s just not right</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">the fact is there are bad people out</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s not common to run into them you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">know sometimes you do and it can mess</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">things up but</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">in general you meet somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">they&#39;re decent and they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">figure it out and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">proceeding from</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">different data maybe different values</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re not they&#39;re not bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">um so the assumption that they are is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">just incredibly destructive</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">right i was at a politicon which uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">is a uh anybody who doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">when what we do instead is judge people</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">signed up with the republican party if</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">they belonged to a party</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">that was making some kind of sense in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">other words i have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">the principle that i use is i don&#39;t hold</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">for bad decisions if they didn&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">and the thing that has struck me for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">long time is that americans are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">two very bad decisions right</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">you know it&#39;s two different failure</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">modes and so you know i can&#39;t fault you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">for being a republican because</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">what else would you be i mean you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">be a democrat but</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">uh you know that is to many minds</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">an equally dangerous if different</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">uh possibility and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">just think about the fact i&#39;m frequently</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">challenged by people about unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">and their point is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">always the only thing is to defeat trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">right that&#39;s what must be done i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">see anything past that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">who they nominate doesn&#39;t matter who the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">vp is i&#39;m voting for him because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">only thing is donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">now if that was really the way the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">democratic party saw things</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it have put aside nonsense and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">given us</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">much better candidates in other words i</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">don&#39;t think the democratic party the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">machine inside of it believes this</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">because if it really thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">only thing that was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">you know the only priority we should</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">have was defeating donald trump it would</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">have given us candidates</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t that were beyond question</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">even if it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">compromised them with respect to their</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">donors or whatever but instead it gave</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">incredibly feeble candidates who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">not popular with anybody that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">terrible move if you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">that donald trump is an existential</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">threat so at some level the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">are signed up for a false narrative the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">the parties have set up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">a battle for us that they it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">the one they&#39;re involved in</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">so um you know what is the good option i</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">mean this is really</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">this is the motivation behind unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">is i&#39;m sick and tired of being left in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">situation where there just simply isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">a good option</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m supposed to be upset at my</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">fellow americans for choosing</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">some bad option that happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">different than the bad option i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">chosen</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">enough of that already</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">nate i&#39;ve got a i&#39;m i&#39;m curious so just</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">discussions conversations you know they</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">always say don&#39;t talk about politics</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">religion at dinner table of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">but um stuff comes up i mean with</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">everything being politicized how does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">not these days</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">uh you know and my my parents are</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">you know conservative um and we grew up</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">um you know a lot of conservative values</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">and grew up</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">with religion and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">however i also grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">el cerrito california which is right</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">between berkeley and richmond</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">um which is arguably probably one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">most liberal places in the country</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">so i think i had the good fortune as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">young child to kind of grow up with both</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">of those things</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">my parents also like they enjoy you know</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">likes to travel a lot and like so they</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">do these things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">i guess traditionally not not really</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">conservative things</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">um and uh they&#39;re sort of outside the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">box people</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">and i think that they just you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">biggest thing for</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">for them is just the frustration and the</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">which way i mean it depends on the topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">it depends on the situation i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">that&#39;s how it should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.399" style="s2">it depends on depends on what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">discussing what is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got varying viewpoints on</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">that stuff and you know i&#39;m big on</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">people um taking care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">you know what i mean and figure things</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">out invest their ability if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">way forward and they need assistance</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">they need help</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">of course we make that we figure that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">out but i don&#39;t like this reliance on</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">somebody else taking care of you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">and you know complaining about things</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">but then expecting somebody else to fix</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">the problem or to fix it for you i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:35.280" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">at the same time i don&#39;t like that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">know i don&#39;t think it should be every</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">man for themself</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">and uh you know when people come from a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">tougher situation a tougher background</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a lot of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">maybe didn&#39;t have the right guidance um</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">they need that mentorship and leadership</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">and opportunities that they would not</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">normally have they need</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">a chance you know an additional</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">way forward and then it&#39;s up to them at</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">some point it&#39;s up to you to realize</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">those things that&#39;s not really like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">simple thing to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">um to lay out</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">you know but i think that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">my biggest thing is like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">is is ownership in ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">say need yeah go ahead well i was uh i</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">wanted to if it&#39;s there i wanted to tie</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">something to what brett had just uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">said here it&#39;s interesting hearing about</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">the distribution in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">the sentiments in your in your family</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">and sort of where you come down because</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">yourself seem to be kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">amalgamation of the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">of you know the points of view that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">you&#39;re explaining or in your family i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">just wondering</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">think of a family member who has a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">picture of ronald reagan</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">up somewhere in their house or on their</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">truck or anything like that</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">yeah yeah and the reason the reason i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">ask and brett this is this is tying back</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">to your point about no good options</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">and why people vote for the parties that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">they vote for often times</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">um when i was campaigning for office um</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">you know it was very common for me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">see pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">the obamas barack michelle their</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">on folks mantle pieces uh in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">doors that i would knock on right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">you might say well that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">african-americans no it wasn&#39;t african</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">americans but even taking the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">obama phenomena and putting it aside</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">because that was somewhat unique</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">but i was raised with kennedy nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">in a big big way</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">you know as a kid i was raised knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">the story of camelot what camelot was</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">this new era that kennedy was ushering</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">in but i know that there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">segment of the country for whom</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">you know ronald reagan he&#39;s he is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">figure in our cultural memory for many</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">folks and for many other folks he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">something of a demon right which is part</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">of the issue here</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">but the cultural memory of ronald reagan</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">is representing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">reinvigoration this renewal of american</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">optimism</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">you know a guy born forth from</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">um the reason i mention all that brett</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">is because i think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">when you wonder to yourself brett why is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">it that the democratic party has seemed</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">to produce weak and feeble candidates if</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">it was serious about giving us a a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">better option than what was on the table</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">and you could even say something similar</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">about the republicans and why the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">republican party</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">selected trump to begin with but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">certainly in the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">there is this fracturing of the</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:25.520" style="s2">wonder what you what you do with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">ball</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.520" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">well first i wanted to respond a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">bit i hear something</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">very interesting in both your stories</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">you know nate can&#39;t quite figure out</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">whether he&#39;s right or left and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">actually find something totally</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">beautiful about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">right because i think it&#39;s the hallmark</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">of somebody who&#39;s actually doing their</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">own work</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">right if you do your own work why would</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">come out with one of these slates or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">other right you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">your particular values will result in</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">you landing on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">a unique uh set of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">uh of answers and desired objectives</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">and i hear something similar in your</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">story john i hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">that you know you&#39;re you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">enough of a republican that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">headed up the the la county chapter</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">and yet you campaigned for</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">obama um so you know i i hear you doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">your own work too and i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">as much as i will swear to you that i am</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">a radical</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">right um i find myself in the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">to me radical means one thing it means i</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">radical change is necessary to save us</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">i would want us to contemplate it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s too damn dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">otherwise right you engage in radical</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">change when you don&#39;t have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">but in terms of where my values land</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s also eclectic right there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">things about what i believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">that do match better what conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">tend to believe and then there are other</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">where i seem much more like a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">in any case what i think is missing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">is the safe harbor for people</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">who are of the same mind that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">apparently are</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">and you know this didn&#39;t come up before</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">we were on screen here together</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">we discovered this in real time but i</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">think the point is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">lots of people would have this instinct</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">maybe everybody would</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">but the um the penalties that come to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">if you evidence that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">thinking differently about these</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">individual issues</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">are such that people are incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">out of it and if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">we obviously at unity 2020 have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">objective and it does involve</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">uh curing the body politic of its</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">corruption by starting at the top</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">and you know actually draining the swamp</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">not draining it to put in a golf course</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">but draining it because</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be a swamp but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">to the extent that that&#39;s what we do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">also have a secondary objective</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">i think which is as we have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">discussions necessary to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">how we can address our political</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">we are also providing evidence to people</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">that there is a way to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">independently</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">to land on different conclusions than</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">the people that you&#39;re breaking bread</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">with and to have it not be a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">and if that can spread that is in and of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">a very worthwhile objective</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">um deals get done in business you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this is our offer this is our</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">counter and you figure things out you</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">know and you make a deal</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s not how that&#39;s not how this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">is working right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s how it probably should</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">work and that&#39;s why things get hung up</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">for months and sometimes years uh you</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">know in the senate and congress and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">they just don&#39;t happen because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">one way</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">all the other way we&#39;re pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">through we&#39;re halting it</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">and then we&#39;re just gonna quit you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the government&#39;s another government</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">shutdown coming and blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s just very frustrating and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">mind-numbing as a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">i think also as a veteran you know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">you fought for that you fought for</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t care man</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">are very appreciative of our veteran</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">community and i love that you know</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">she said</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">pretty much said what you did you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">after having</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">a pretty balanced sounds like reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">human conversation it just ended so</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">i i heard something in what you said and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">you just blew right by it but it struck</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">me as so</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">important and so rarely discussed you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">that as a soldier you were fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">even the people you disagree with now at</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">one level that should go without saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">but i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">people have lost touch with this and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">must say</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve never been in the military but i do</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">um that when i am forced to politics and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">not my instinct i don&#39;t like it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">unity 2020 for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">is an attempt to fix things for</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">even the people who swear that i&#39;m evil</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">for even contemplating anything other</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">than uh you know the main menu of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">right this isn&#39;t about that patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">is about the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">that um there is something that unites</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">that has nothing to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:25.200" style="s2">that we do agree over dinner or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s about a bigger project than</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.200" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">that and i see</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">very few people are even aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">um you know and this it&#39;s worse when</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">this happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">at the level of the president because as</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">you point out john</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">you know the role of the president is in</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">some ways a technical role</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a symbolic role right they</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">have to lead which means they have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">give voice to um the collective public</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">and when you have you know i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">harder on the democrats here because in</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">some sense trump was a break</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">with the broken republican party in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">favor of something that i also find</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">quite broken</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">but nonetheless it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">republican party</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">that i grew up with on the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">side though</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">i mean if we go back to 2016 and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">uh you know michael kinsley says a uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">a gaff a political gaffe is when a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">politician</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">accidentally tells the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">you know when hillary clinton called</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">republicans a basket of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">deplorables she was basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">something in the wrong context</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">that was something she would have said</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">in a private context and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">should have held her tongue in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">public context because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">revealed exactly what kind of disdain</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">she had for some large fraction</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">of the people she claimed to want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">lead and so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the modern democratic party at</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">this point and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">the question i guess is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">most americans really do agree over the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">basics we don&#39;t agree on the priorities</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">we don&#39;t agree to how close we are to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">you know a really functional system but</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">we agree on what a functional system</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">would be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">generally we know that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">hidden tribes report which i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">frequently says that something like 86</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">percent of us agree on</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">what america should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">but in this context where we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">artificially divided by</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">parties that um are being steered by</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">their fringes and by</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">um machine politics a parasite at their</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">how is it that we can wake people up</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">to their shared humanity and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">the destruction that is brought to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">by these corrupt parties</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">right well so i from my vantage point</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">there are a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">need to happen um so on a broader sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">of cultural level of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">i tend to speak in terms of saying there</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">needs to be kind of a way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">understanding the story of america that</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">makes clear</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">the fact that as different as all of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">different streams of history are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">they sort of join stream in this larger</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">river of progress that seems to realize</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">but i mean to your point where the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:41.760" style="s2">question is how do you actualize that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">in in society and i think that on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:43.839" style="s2">one hand</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">the work that we&#39;re doing again at</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">but the work of actually creating the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">context in which the american people and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">this live stream is an example of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">uh the work of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">being able to create the context where</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">we can actually meet each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">uh within a framework of communication</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t predispose us</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">towards seeing each other through</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">through a jaded sort of prism</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">creating the act the space for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">actually building the structures in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">which that is possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">is very much necessary because right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">the structures that we lean on cable</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">news talk radio</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">the general sort of media culture uh and</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">increasingly uh the traditional</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">universities</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which this can creep</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">into the church and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">religion and other places where we meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">each other in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">um increasingly these traditional sorts</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">of contexts where we meet each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">uh only allow us to meet each other in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">an oppositional</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">sort of way and so on the one hand we</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">have to be innovative in creating</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">the space for the american people to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">engage in that way and so again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">what the work of braver angels is about</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">many folks are working on but even at</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.720" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">for those of us who want to lead in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.720" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">reconciliatory direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">we have to be able to speak in these</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">sorts of unifying terms in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">structures that already exist</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">and so you know part of what i try to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">and brett i think that in your way you</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">try to do this</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">too as a matter of fact you do try to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">this let me not even qualify this</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">um and nate i see you doing it too man</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.240" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">whether we&#39;re on a right leaning or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">left-leaning uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">outlet or on a podcast or anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">to speak in terms of saying look this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">subjective perspective but i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">from a bed of ideas which are aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:35.839" style="s2">establishing</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">the common good right that ultimately we</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.839" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">want to generate opportunity for all</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">ultimately we want to be sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">the differences in people&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">points so we can understand their</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">positions</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">and communicate with one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">our language cannot shift on the level</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">of fundamental values</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">depending on whether or not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">speaking to a conservative audience or</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">liberal audience because that just makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">us like the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">who can&#39;t manage to hold to some truer</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">kind of ground</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">in terms of articulating a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">that is for all of the american people</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">as much as is possible so there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">game and as much as we need to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">hold and build up</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:15.599" style="s2">ground in the context that we can shape</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">and control and then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">offensive game</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">where we need to get into the end zone</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">with the message</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">uh that can take root even in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">established kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">media outlets and so forth and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">difficulty there becomes getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">past the gatekeepers so to speak or you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">know finding your way to these places</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">these contexts are sort of designed in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">way to service</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">the polarized partisan establishments</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a hunger in america for this</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">and that makes me think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">ways to get this ball into the end zone</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">part pardon the the corny football</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">trump flag in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">yard because he&#39;s the president damn it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">and you know</p>

<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">not that you should be worshiping the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">american flag either but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">uh i i remember growing up and only</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">seeing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">that was a popular thing most people in</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">our country</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">saw that as a beacon of hope most people</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">around the world see that a speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">hope</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">and now it is like you know it is such a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">divisive</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">object and uh it just</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">yeah it it really that really</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">is something that that shot of a that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">shot of humility</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">um that everybody&#39;s gonna have to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">in order for this to actually work</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">for this dramatic change this revolution</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">to occur which is necessary is for</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">truly find who are the individuals who</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">people that would best represent all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">us listen to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">take into account all of our concerns</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">and try to find uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">try to find what&#39;s best for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">i mean and that&#39;s it&#39;s not an easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">to do but</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">where it stands right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">these candidates</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">they&#39;re representing half the country</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not representing the nation</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not representing the american</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">they&#39;re representing half of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">american people they&#39;re fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">half the american people they just hope</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">that more of their half shows up to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">booths</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">on november 4th or november 3rd</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:05.040" style="s2">whichever day it is i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">november 3rd</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">then the other sides 50 you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">hopefully two out of three of mine show</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">up and only half of their show up so we</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">win</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">because then i&#39;m good to represent my</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">team and i don&#39;t really care about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">other team</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">i just want to represent to represent my</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">team well the problem though</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a hard thing to say but</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:28.720" style="s2">driven to say it a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">response to um</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">what john said about biden being seeming</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">like the safe choice</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think he does seem like the safe</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">choice in fact i think he seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">very perilous choice but he does seem</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">safe with respect</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">to what the dnc represents</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">and so i would just point out that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something absurd</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">about the fact that the democrats claim</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">to want to win and to have to win for</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">the good of the nation</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">there were candidates that did capture</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">that did spark people&#39;s passion and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">were all</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">sidelined in favor of a candidate</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t inspire anyone even at his</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">best he didn&#39;t inspire</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">but in his hasn&#39;t lived in the real</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">world in 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">hasn&#39;t lived in the real world in 50</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">years doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">have any unique ideas to speak of i</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">can&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">one um it has demonstrated through</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">his choice of a running mate now that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">this is all about the dnc view of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">and so and i&#39;d also just point out in</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">passing a couple of other things</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">he announced his running mate in text</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">now i&#39;ve noticed as others have that</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">there is a difference</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">in how cogent he seems when he&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">even when it&#39;s scripted and when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">for example tweeting</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">or delivering a note that&#39;s very ominous</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">the idea that we would elect somebody</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">who at this point you know once upon a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">he could deliver a pretty fair speech he</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t appear to be capable of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about governing a nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">nation and leading it in a time</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">of tremendous polarization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">manifestly not safe to elect a person</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">that compromised but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do it and the reason well</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that we&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">but we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">the democrats would have us do it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">the reason that they have chosen the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:33.040" style="s2">candidate that inspires</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">no one over candidates that inspired</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.040" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">was that those candidates that inspired</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">people did so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">because they actually represented a kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">change and the fact is i&#39;ve said for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:47.920" style="s2">long time that the dnc&#39;s purpose</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">is to prevent meaningful change we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">have anything else we want but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">have meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">change and so that&#39;s what joe biden</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">represents he represents</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">no meaningful change and the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">the dnc does not want meaningful change</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">is because it represents established</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">interests who are threatened by change</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re not threatened by the status</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">quo and at some level it&#39;s that simple</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.559" style="s2">and you can see how this plays out in</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.559" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">not only did they nominate</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">uh or did they put kamala harris on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">ticket in the vp spot</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">but they denied andrew yang a spot to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:22.559" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">at the convention when he clearly did</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.559" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">inspire a great many of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">why would they do that because he</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">represents an actual</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:32.319" style="s2">uh path to change and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">unacceptable to them and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.319" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">to snub him</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">once again so at some level i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">people need to wake up to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.640" style="s2">just as the republican party is not the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">one that we grew up with</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.640" end="00:59:46.319" style="s2">the democratic party is not the one we</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">grew up with either it has</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.319" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">effectively got a parasitic infection</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.640" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like it has rabies</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">and you know to do its bidding is to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:56.559" style="s2">the bidding of the disease not the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">bidding of the people it once</p>

<p begin="01:04:26.319" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">uh i think is right but the there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">just an irony to it</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">and the irony is that the status quo</p>

<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">through time that&#39;s what it does and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">to the extent that the black community</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:58.319" style="s2">by the dnc not because the dnc is</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">and the status quo leaves people in</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;re unlucky you&#39;re born into this zip</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.799" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">code that means you&#39;re going to face all</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">right so i guess my point is</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:21.119" style="s2">symbolically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">he may be a a safe seeming choice</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">for black voters but what he represents</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">is anything but</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">safe for black voters and um</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">so in any case oh go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">no no just to say that that&#39;s why i say</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">none of that analysis i think runs the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">foul of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">right um from the standard from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">vantage point of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">how some people are thinking and how</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:46.240" style="s2">they relate to our political candidates</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:47.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.240" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s important to have that larger</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">social frame right and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">parallel thing to be said about</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">donald donald trump which we could go</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">into if we wanted but the point is it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:58.160" style="s2">totally possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">for a politician to be somebody who who</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.160" end="01:06:01.200" style="s2">seems to genuinely connect</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:03.359" style="s2">with his constituency and maybe he</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.200" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">really does you know i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.359" end="01:06:08.000" style="s2">to be charitable right and yet still</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">operate in service</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.000" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">to a structural you know mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">established status quo</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:18.720" style="s2">that continues uh to drain opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:20.319" style="s2">uh from the very constituent groups from</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.720" end="01:06:21.520" style="s2">the very people that that politician</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">professes to serve</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.520" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">those two things can absolutely be true</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">at the same time and yet understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2">that possibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.400" end="01:06:32.799" style="s2">is still perhaps important for warding</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">ourselves away from the temptation</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.799" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">to totally demonize some of these folks</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">even some of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:40.319" style="s2">political leaders because it can be the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">case of course that again person can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.319" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">in service to something that is corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">and not working</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">and still have some good intentions at</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:47.359" style="s2">play or some real social connections</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.039" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.359" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">that account for who they are and why</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">they are where they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">so moral reality becomes complicated</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:06:58.640" style="s2">but the the need to recognize the way in</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:01.760" style="s2">which the system</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.640" end="01:07:03.760" style="s2">turns on those it serves is still</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.760" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">something we can look at with very sober</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.760" end="01:07:08.559" style="s2">eyes well i</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:10.400" style="s2">i quite agree with that and you know i</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:12.079" style="s2">think i have taken great pains not to</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.400" end="01:07:15.039" style="s2">demonize joe biden</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.079" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">as a person um you know to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.039" end="01:07:18.559" style="s2">that i&#39;m dehumanizing something it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">dnc which isn&#39;t a human</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.559" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s fair um but</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">you know my point would be look at some</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">as long as you play this game at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:31.760" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">of symbolism then you will be owned by</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">things like the dnc which will play the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">symbolic game pretty well and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">feed you something that feels</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">safe and familiar and all the while</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">they&#39;re robbing you</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">out the back door and the point about</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">unity 2020 is that it is an alternative</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">that is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">symbolism first in fact it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">symbolism at all</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:57.039" style="s2">it is a gamble on the idea that if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">simply gave people who were above</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.039" end="01:08:01.200" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">and understood values on both sides of</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">the aisle</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">if you gave them sufficient power by</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">speeding them past the corrupting</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:08.720" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.119" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">and into a position where they could</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.720" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">actually lead</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">that that would actually do a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">amount for communities like the black</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.480" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">like the american indian community like</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">all people who are</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:22.400" style="s2">facing economic and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:23.759" style="s2">oppression just by virtue of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.400" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">that they would be inclined to do the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.759" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">thing and the right thing will correct</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">those problems automatically</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:31.839" style="s2">not fully right we can&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">perfection but it will at least move us</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.839" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">in the right direction so</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping that people will tune into</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">this conversation and others</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:41.120" style="s2">and they will realize that it is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">symbolism that has allowed things to get</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.120" end="01:08:46.159" style="s2">so bad because symbolism is cheap</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:47.920" style="s2">right and that the substance can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.159" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">fixed but it does involve us</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.920" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">departing the narrative in which we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:54.239" style="s2">no choice but to vote</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">for the standard options</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.239" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">yeah right well yeah i mean and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:04.159" style="s2">this is why i emphasize up top um</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">nate my my uh enthusiasm for unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.159" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">being born from the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">on the one hand you know yes there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">strategic uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">there&#39;s what we can argue at least is</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">the strategic need to</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">change not just you know who the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">occupant of the white house might be</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:19.759" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s beyond that getting folks in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.759" end="01:09:22.880" style="s2">office and i think this applies on every</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">level of government right</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.880" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">um who are willing to govern for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">common good and conceptualize their role</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">in that way yet uh on the other hand i</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">feel that</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:36.239" style="s2">you know and even for folks brett who</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">may not be supporting unity 2020 at this</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.239" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">moment but who are</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">engaged in this conversation to say look</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">one way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">our politics and who we elect are going</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:46.560" style="s2">to be a reflection</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.880" end="01:09:48.480" style="s2">of the very spirit of the sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:50.640" style="s2">conversations that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.480" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">with each other are we demonizing each</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.640" end="01:09:54.320" style="s2">other and shutting each other out</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">are we open to one another&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">and perspectives and looking to create</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">some wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:02.159" style="s2">that is greater than the sum of its</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:04.719" style="s2">parts right and so i see unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.159" end="01:10:06.719" style="s2">as growing out of this this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.719" end="01:10:08.640" style="s2">movement in this direction where this</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.719" end="01:10:10.000" style="s2">big heterodox kind of</p>

<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:19.520" style="s2">um and if we don&#39;t even if we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.760" end="01:12:20.960" style="s2">try if we just accept that this is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.520" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">way that it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.960" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;s always going to be like this and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that we can do</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">then if this is this is the way it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:34.719" style="s2">um i don&#39;t accept that i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.719" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">people feel the same way</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.719" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s not simple i mean how do</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:42.080" style="s2">we make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s got to be a huge team</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:44.400" style="s2">effort</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:46.080" style="s2">as brett has said it&#39;s got to be a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.400" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">ground swell</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.080" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">from people from individuals everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">got to</p>

<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">fight for this and</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.920" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">that is the only way we get out of our</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:01.840" style="s2">own way</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:03.440" style="s2">is by doing something dramatic yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah by the way mate you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.440" end="01:13:06.960" style="s2">good president&#39;s chin i&#39;d say very</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.360" end="01:13:08.800" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.960" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">is that why you&#39;re on here man is brett</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.800" end="01:13:11.920" style="s2">we have our dark horse candidate uh on</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:13.840" style="s2">the line with us</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.920" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">are we are we gearing in for a surprise</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.840" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">announcement or maybe maybe next</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">elections</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">well i i should tell you so first of all</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:22.080" style="s2">i want to uh react a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">um to what nate has said you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.080" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">something dramatic has to happen or</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">we will have the illusion of moving very</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">fast and</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.600" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">and the reality of getting nowhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:34.159" style="s2">not going to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:35.840" style="s2">easier or safer so to the extent that it</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.159" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">does not feel easy or safe</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.840" end="01:13:39.120" style="s2">that&#39;s an argument for doing it now</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:40.880" style="s2">rather than later and</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.120" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">i think the other thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.880" end="01:13:43.520" style="s2">drawing to a close of this first hour</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">here and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.520" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">the what i&#39;m getting from this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.560" end="01:13:53.040" style="s2">this conversation flawed sprawling as it</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.000" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">may be</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.040" end="01:13:59.840" style="s2">is vastly better it feels better</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.960" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">it has more weight to it than the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.840" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">polarized conversation that we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">bombarded by</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:09.360" style="s2">all the time in normal venues</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2">so the real point is look if you can see</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.360" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">that this is better</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.400" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">and you can see that we are trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">something to deviate our course</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:18.400" style="s2">enough that we just don&#39;t get more and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:21.840" style="s2">more opportunities to</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.400" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">uh to go after each other then</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.840" end="01:14:25.920" style="s2">join us and it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.080" style="s2">committing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.920" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">to anything the fact is we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.080" end="01:14:31.440" style="s2">nomination process we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:33.120" style="s2">putting forward names and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.440" end="01:14:34.560" style="s2">heartening actually to see these names</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:35.920" style="s2">come in and see how many</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.560" end="01:14:37.600" style="s2">really good people that you would love</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.920" end="01:14:39.600" style="s2">to see elected to office</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.600" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">you know submitted as nominations and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.600" end="01:14:42.880" style="s2">how many people are thinking carefully</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">about this enough to submit these</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.880" end="01:14:46.080" style="s2">these nominations for us to um to</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">advance them</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.080" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">so if that feels better to you than</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:54.480" style="s2">then join us and what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">find is a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.480" end="01:14:59.760" style="s2">really interesting people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:02.080" style="s2">alike in many regards but are aligned</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.760" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">over the shared sense that we must do</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.080" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:06.719" style="s2">and that our differences as big as they</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.520" end="01:15:11.440" style="s2">are are small</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.719" end="01:15:13.520" style="s2">relative to that which unifies us so</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.440" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s where we should oh go</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.520" end="01:15:16.719" style="s2">ahead john</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.640" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">oh no i was just uh saying amen and</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.719" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">hallelujah that&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">i think what we should do um i loved uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:27.120" style="s2">both of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:29.600" style="s2">final statements that you you gave i</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.120" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:32.880" style="s2">to go further with that i would like to</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">take a break now</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.880" end="01:15:37.760" style="s2">to look at some of the feedback we got</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:40.960" style="s2">on our initial</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.760" end="01:15:43.920" style="s2">questions and then to re-gather in</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.960" end="01:15:45.199" style="s2">15 minutes for some discussion in which</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">we will try to interact with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.199" end="01:15:48.000" style="s2">audience who has assembled</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:50.480" style="s2">and get a sense for what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.000" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">thinking how does that sound</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.480" end="01:15:56.960" style="s2">sounds good to me all right great</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.520" end="01:15:58.159" style="s2">so um stay put if you&#39;re there</p>

<p begin="01:36:09.040" end="01:36:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re able to see that on your screen</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.199" end="01:36:16.080" style="s2">um and uh this is the percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.480" end="01:36:18.560" style="s2">people likely to agree</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.080" end="01:36:20.639" style="s2">with each answer and i can also sort</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.560" end="01:36:21.280" style="s2">this so what let&#39;s let&#39;s do this brad</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.639" end="01:36:24.159" style="s2">let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.280" end="01:36:25.199" style="s2">the answers most likely for trump voters</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.159" end="01:36:27.440" style="s2">to agree with</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.199" end="01:36:29.440" style="s2">and um maybe you want to kind of talk</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.440" end="01:36:29.840" style="s2">through these first top two answers here</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.440" end="01:36:31.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.840" end="01:36:33.520" style="s2">get people&#39;s feelings about that and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.760" end="01:36:35.040" style="s2">these are just to be clear these are</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.520" end="01:36:38.320" style="s2">answers that were submitted</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.040" end="01:36:40.880" style="s2">by people uh logged into this tool</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.320" end="01:36:42.400" style="s2">and then these were the top vote getters</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.880" end="01:36:44.000" style="s2">so people could submit an answer and</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.400" end="01:36:45.520" style="s2">then other people voted them sort of</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.000" end="01:36:49.440" style="s2">reddit style</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.520" end="01:36:51.520" style="s2">uh to to reach the top is that right</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.440" end="01:36:53.280" style="s2">um so uh the the first part of that is</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.520" end="01:36:56.320" style="s2">right what i want to say is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.280" end="01:36:59.119" style="s2">reddit style we use um algorithms uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.320" end="01:37:00.560" style="s2">to figure out what what&#39;s called uh</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.119" end="01:37:03.199" style="s2">matrix completion</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.560" end="01:37:05.040" style="s2">um and synthetic voting uh so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.199" end="01:37:06.719" style="s2">some artificial intelligence and machine</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.040" end="01:37:08.960" style="s2">learning behind all of this</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.719" end="01:37:10.960" style="s2">uh so what that means is that people</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.960" end="01:37:12.880" style="s2">don&#39;t need to vote on every single</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.960" end="01:37:14.400" style="s2">answer for us to have statistically</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.880" end="01:37:17.040" style="s2">relevant results</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.400" end="01:37:19.119" style="s2">instead by voting on answers within a</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.040" end="01:37:21.040" style="s2">two to three minute time period</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.119" end="01:37:22.239" style="s2">as uh as many as you you feel</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.040" end="01:37:24.960" style="s2">comfortable voting on</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.239" end="01:37:25.920" style="s2">we&#39;re able to get this percentage likely</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.960" end="01:37:28.320" style="s2">to agree</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.920" end="01:37:30.719" style="s2">um the more people the more confident we</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.320" end="01:37:34.239" style="s2">are in that score</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.719" end="01:37:35.920" style="s2">i see so the first answer uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.239" end="01:37:38.239" style="s2">is the republic is in danger and our</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.920" end="01:37:41.520" style="s2">country is facing a potential</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.239" end="01:37:41.920" style="s2">takeover or takedown of all we hold to</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.520" end="01:37:45.600" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.920" end="01:37:49.040" style="s2">american and this was this 69</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.600" end="01:37:49.920" style="s2">of respondents resonated 78 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.040" end="01:37:52.480" style="s2">trump voters</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.920" end="01:37:54.080" style="s2">resonated and 64 percent of biden voters</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.480" end="01:37:58.320" style="s2">resonated</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.080" end="01:38:01.440" style="s2">so uh an overarching fear</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.320" end="01:38:02.239" style="s2">that something is going to take over and</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.440" end="01:38:06.080" style="s2">take down</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.239" end="01:38:08.480" style="s2">the core values of the country</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.080" end="01:38:09.199" style="s2">all right second one there is a real</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.480" end="01:38:11.199" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.199" end="01:38:12.639" style="s2">that one of these two things will happen</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.199" end="01:38:13.199" style="s2">people will lose confidence in</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.639" end="01:38:14.880" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.199" end="01:38:18.080" style="s2">to the extent that law and order breaks</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.880" end="01:38:20.239" style="s2">down or conversely the powers that be</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.080" end="01:38:22.480" style="s2">will use the social unrest to further</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.239" end="01:38:24.400" style="s2">their own executive authority</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.480" end="01:38:26.159" style="s2">so either things come apart or they</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.400" end="01:38:29.679" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.159" end="01:38:32.320" style="s2">authoritarian in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.679" end="01:38:33.840" style="s2">bureaucratic sense that the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.320" end="01:38:34.880" style="s2">of law and order breaking down will be</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.840" end="01:38:37.280" style="s2">utilized</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.880" end="01:38:39.760" style="s2">by the powers that be resonated by</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.280" end="01:38:42.480" style="s2">resonated for 70 percent of respondents</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.760" end="01:38:43.760" style="s2">trump voters resonated somewhat more 77</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.480" end="01:38:46.639" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.760" end="01:38:48.480" style="s2">and biden voters 70. so something about</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.639" end="01:38:49.280" style="s2">the ai is causing those numbers not to</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.480" end="01:38:53.199" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.280" end="01:38:55.520" style="s2">um compatible in an obvious way but</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.199" end="01:38:56.480" style="s2">um that&#39;s the percentage agreement so</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.520" end="01:38:59.280" style="s2">what one way to</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.480" end="01:38:59.920" style="s2">one way you could interpret this is um</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.280" end="01:39:02.239" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.920" end="01:39:04.080" style="s2">mostly trump voters agreed a lot with</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.239" end="01:39:06.320" style="s2">this right</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.080" end="01:39:07.920" style="s2">but but biden voters also agreed with</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.320" end="01:39:09.840" style="s2">these statements what i think i&#39;d point</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.920" end="01:39:12.560" style="s2">out here is on the right hand column</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.840" end="01:39:14.320" style="s2">people who would vote for biden are are</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.560" end="01:39:15.920" style="s2">many of them would agree with the same</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.320" end="01:39:16.480" style="s2">things that trump voters would agree</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.920" end="01:39:19.119" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.480" end="01:39:20.400" style="s2">um and then this all another thing if we</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.119" end="01:39:22.880" style="s2">add up these numbers here</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.400" end="01:39:24.239" style="s2">50 50 there&#39;s 103 people here but almost</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.880" end="01:39:27.360" style="s2">200 people voting</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.239" end="01:39:28.639" style="s2">so about half of your audience would not</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.360" end="01:39:30.639" style="s2">vote for trump or</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.639" end="01:39:32.239" style="s2">vote for biden right awesome variety of</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.639" end="01:39:34.000" style="s2">reasons now if we sort this</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.239" end="01:39:35.360" style="s2">for what the biden voters agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.000" end="01:39:37.199" style="s2">can see the same plays out we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.360" end="01:39:40.800" style="s2">to have some different answers here</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.199" end="01:39:42.639" style="s2">uh but again there&#39;s a lot of alignment</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.800" end="01:39:44.639" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s interesting the trump and</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.639" end="01:39:45.760" style="s2">biden voters the would-be trump and</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.639" end="01:39:48.239" style="s2">biden voters</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.760" end="01:39:51.199" style="s2">are resonating with the same uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.239" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">statements at slightly different rates</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.199" end="01:39:55.040" style="s2">should we go two more answers and by the</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:39:57.600" style="s2">way john and nate</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.040" end="01:39:58.400" style="s2">you are welcome to react to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.600" end="01:40:00.880" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.400" end="01:40:01.840" style="s2">and to propose things that you would</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.880" end="01:40:03.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.840" end="01:40:05.280" style="s2">the audience to be queried about in real</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.760" end="01:40:09.600" style="s2">time so</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.280" end="01:40:13.360" style="s2">anything yet not at this moment sir</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.600" end="01:40:15.360" style="s2">okay so um</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.360" end="01:40:16.719" style="s2">third answer we have two parties that</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.360" end="01:40:18.480" style="s2">act like street gangs</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.719" end="01:40:21.760" style="s2">putting their party&#39;s interest before</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.480" end="01:40:24.239" style="s2">that of the people loyalty to move</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.760" end="01:40:26.080" style="s2">loyalty to money and interest first</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.239" end="01:40:27.600" style="s2">endless pointless wars</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.080" end="01:40:29.760" style="s2">as long as we keep settling for these</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.600" end="01:40:32.560" style="s2">candidates the polarization continues</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.760" end="01:40:33.840" style="s2">well that&#39;s interesting that uh mirrors</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.560" end="01:40:35.199" style="s2">many of the things that we were saying</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.840" end="01:40:38.000" style="s2">in our</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.199" end="01:40:38.400" style="s2">first hour of discussion i think this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.000" end="01:40:42.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.400" end="01:40:43.280" style="s2">and again the um looks like above 70</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.159" end="01:40:46.159" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.280" end="01:40:47.520" style="s2">resonance across the board and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.159" end="01:40:51.520" style="s2">fourth one you got to scroll up a little</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.520" end="01:40:53.360" style="s2">bit for me to see it completely</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.520" end="01:40:54.880" style="s2">political polarization is preventing</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.360" end="01:40:55.840" style="s2">everyday folks from engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.880" end="01:40:57.280" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.840" end="01:40:59.119" style="s2">they&#39;re so far wedged into their</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.280" end="01:40:59.920" style="s2">political corners silos and echo</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.119" end="01:41:02.080" style="s2">chambers</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.920" end="01:41:03.360" style="s2">that they&#39;re all convinced the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.080" end="01:41:06.480" style="s2">party is to blame</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.360" end="01:41:09.440" style="s2">or that trump alone is the problem</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.480" end="01:41:10.000" style="s2">yep and again 70 or above across the</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.440" end="01:41:13.440" style="s2">board</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.000" end="01:41:15.600" style="s2">so what i get out of this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.440" end="01:41:16.880" style="s2">this is a little bit what the scales</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.600" end="01:41:19.360" style="s2">falling from the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.880" end="01:41:20.960" style="s2">sounds like that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.360" end="01:41:21.760" style="s2">people who are still caught up in some</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.960" end="01:41:25.199" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.760" end="01:41:26.719" style="s2">about um you know trump is the only</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.199" end="01:41:30.960" style="s2">thing that we must focus on</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.719" end="01:41:32.719" style="s2">or the converse is that uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.960" end="01:41:34.639" style="s2">you know the marxists have taken over</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.719" end="01:41:35.679" style="s2">the democratic party or something along</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.639" end="01:41:37.679" style="s2">those lines</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.679" end="01:41:40.159" style="s2">and for those of us who are beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.679" end="01:41:43.199" style="s2">understand that we are being played</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.159" end="01:41:45.600" style="s2">this is the recognition these are the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.199" end="01:41:46.639" style="s2">the ways that that recognition manifests</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.600" end="01:41:48.880" style="s2">in the mind</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.639" end="01:41:50.320" style="s2">are these particular fears about the</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.880" end="01:41:53.760" style="s2">danger that this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.320" end="01:41:54.639" style="s2">putting us in does this resonate for you</p>

<p begin="01:42:09.760" end="01:42:13.040" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.040" end="01:42:14.400" style="s2">would that are probably fall into those</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.040" end="01:42:18.400" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.400" end="01:42:19.679" style="s2">um as far as you know the echo chambers</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.400" end="01:42:23.119" style="s2">and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.679" end="01:42:24.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to see this or</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.119" end="01:42:26.239" style="s2">you know probably wouldn&#39;t agree with it</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.560" end="01:42:27.679" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t admit and that comes back</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.239" end="01:42:29.600" style="s2">to that humility conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.679" end="01:42:32.639" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.600" end="01:42:34.320" style="s2">uh recognize that in themselves that</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.639" end="01:42:36.159" style="s2">they&#39;re probably that</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.320" end="01:42:37.760" style="s2">and they would have a yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.159" end="01:42:39.360" style="s2">but how do you not see that</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.760" end="01:42:40.800" style="s2">trump is destroying this country or how</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.360" end="01:42:43.840" style="s2">do you not see</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.800" end="01:42:46.719" style="s2">the threat of of um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.840" end="01:42:48.159" style="s2">a uh you know a socialized america or</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.719" end="01:42:51.119" style="s2">whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.159" end="01:42:53.280" style="s2">and uh i mean i get that i understand</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.119" end="01:42:56.719" style="s2">that what they&#39;re saying i hear you</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.280" end="01:42:57.440" style="s2">but uh yeah it just it&#39;s exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.719" end="01:43:00.639" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.440" end="01:43:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it is a huge harm to us it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.639" end="01:43:04.000" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.000" end="01:43:05.119" style="s2">and i think i think a lot of people do</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.000" end="01:43:06.480" style="s2">recognize it yeah i think people</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.119" end="01:43:08.639" style="s2">that even fall in those categories</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.480" end="01:43:11.520" style="s2">probably recognize it but to them</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.639" end="01:43:14.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t see any way out they see that</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.520" end="01:43:16.239" style="s2">it is what it is we cannot change it</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.000" end="01:43:18.320" style="s2">so for me it&#39;s the lesser of two evils</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.239" end="01:43:20.400" style="s2">in this situation and that&#39;s that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.320" end="01:43:22.480" style="s2">dangerous i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.400" end="01:43:24.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t i&#39;m not inspired unless i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.480" end="01:43:26.560" style="s2">inspired you know what i mean and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.480" end="01:43:28.320" style="s2">not going to</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.560" end="01:43:30.239" style="s2">attach myself to something if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.320" end="01:43:32.880" style="s2">believe it just because the other way</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.239" end="01:43:34.159" style="s2">or the other side is maybe maybe more</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.880" end="01:43:36.719" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.159" end="01:43:37.600" style="s2">i need to believe it i need to be all in</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.719" end="01:43:39.440" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.600" end="01:43:41.679" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll i&#39;ll fight for what i</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.440" end="01:43:43.360" style="s2">believe in uh and hopefully bring some</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.679" end="01:43:46.159" style="s2">people along with me enough to</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.360" end="01:43:47.760" style="s2">uh you know help us all change the same</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.159" end="01:43:50.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.760" end="01:43:52.000" style="s2">i dig it and i also have uh i have a</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.320" end="01:43:55.440" style="s2">query for the uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.000" end="01:43:56.560" style="s2">for for the audience um i think my my</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.440" end="01:43:59.440" style="s2">question would be</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.560" end="01:44:00.159" style="s2">and this is particularly for folks who i</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.440" end="01:44:01.360" style="s2">think sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.159" end="01:44:03.600" style="s2">you know maybe sort of strongly</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.360" end="01:44:05.679" style="s2">identifies democrats or republicans or</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.600" end="01:44:09.360" style="s2">biden voters and trump voters may be</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.679" end="01:44:09.360" style="s2">more pertinent pertinently but</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.600" end="01:44:17.280" style="s2">do you see values</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.679" end="01:44:18.400" style="s2">and or concerns on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.280" end="01:44:21.679" style="s2">aisle</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.400" end="01:44:24.480" style="s2">that you agree with or relate to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.679" end="01:44:25.600" style="s2">even if you disagree or strongly</p>

<p begin="01:44:25.600" end="01:44:28.800" style="s2">um with the overall politics of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.000" end="01:44:30.400" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.800" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">does that make sense brett or should i</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.400" end="01:44:34.800" style="s2">should i try and articulate that in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.080" end="01:44:36.800" style="s2">shorter kind of way no i got it i think</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.800" end="01:44:38.400" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m guessing noah got it enough to</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.800" end="01:44:41.600" style="s2">to pose it</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.400" end="01:44:42.560" style="s2">yep restate it for in one moment as i</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.600" end="01:44:44.560" style="s2">type it</p>

<p begin="01:46:11.360" end="01:46:15.840" style="s2">and you know the best military leaders i</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.320" end="01:46:17.280" style="s2">ever had were the ones</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.840" end="01:46:18.639" style="s2">that literally listened to everybody it</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.280" end="01:46:20.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter if it was we call it we</p>

<p begin="01:46:31.280" end="01:46:34.400" style="s2">quick fix and right probably correct</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.199" end="01:46:35.199" style="s2">answer that no one was thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.400" end="01:46:37.360" style="s2">because everyone was so</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.199" end="01:46:39.119" style="s2">far in the weeds on like this is the way</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.360" end="01:46:40.560" style="s2">we do things and this is how it&#39;s got to</p>

<p begin="01:46:44.880" end="01:46:48.239" style="s2">that&#39;s strongly lacking in political</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.280" end="01:46:50.320" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.239" end="01:46:52.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t see that it&#39;s like when you get</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.320" end="01:46:52.639" style="s2">into these and it&#39;s tough because i</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.000" end="01:46:54.320" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.639" end="01:46:55.679" style="s2">when it comes to debates you have to</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.320" end="01:46:58.159" style="s2">have ideas</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.679" end="01:47:00.159" style="s2">you have to have your theories they</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.159" end="01:47:03.520" style="s2">probably have to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.159" end="01:47:06.000" style="s2">pretty pretty strong</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.520" end="01:47:06.719" style="s2">pretty radical maybe and pretty new to</p>

<p begin="01:47:06.719" end="01:47:09.920" style="s2">excited and get people interested and</p>

<p begin="01:47:09.920" end="01:47:12.800" style="s2">you know and so you can get elected</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.679" end="01:47:14.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s all about winning you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.800" end="01:47:16.080" style="s2">and then once</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.080" end="01:47:17.679" style="s2">once you get elected it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.080" end="01:47:19.280" style="s2">immediately you&#39;re starting to think</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.679" end="01:47:20.960" style="s2">about re-election</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.280" end="01:47:22.320" style="s2">and preparing for that and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.960" end="01:47:24.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the game</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.320" end="01:47:25.679" style="s2">um but the best the best leaders i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.239" end="01:47:26.960" style="s2">ever encountered both in sports in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.679" end="01:47:28.719" style="s2">military ones that yes they made</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.960" end="01:47:29.760" style="s2">decisions they were just decisive they</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.719" end="01:47:32.080" style="s2">delegated</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.760" end="01:47:33.840" style="s2">they did uh what they needed to do and</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.080" end="01:47:35.840" style="s2">everyone looked up to them and felt</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.840" end="01:47:37.520" style="s2">like this person&#39;s got it like i i trust</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.840" end="01:47:38.960" style="s2">them i will follow them</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.520" end="01:47:40.719" style="s2">but they were better listeners than</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.960" end="01:47:42.320" style="s2">anything else you know and they</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.719" end="01:47:44.080" style="s2">they took it took into took to heart</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.320" end="01:47:46.159" style="s2">what everybody said</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.080" end="01:47:47.760" style="s2">um and sometimes they just said i just</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.159" end="01:47:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea and</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.760" end="01:47:50.000" style="s2">sometimes they said you know what i</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.280" end="01:47:51.600" style="s2">hadn&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.000" end="01:47:53.360" style="s2">that i normally wouldn&#39;t do it that way</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.600" end="01:47:54.800" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.360" end="01:47:56.239" style="s2">we should try this maybe we should maybe</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.800" end="01:47:57.040" style="s2">implement this a little bit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.239" end="01:47:58.480" style="s2">something in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.040" end="01:48:01.840" style="s2">political system as someone who&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.480" end="01:48:03.760" style="s2">super political guy</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.840" end="01:48:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s probably what turns me off about it</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.760" end="01:48:07.840" style="s2">more than anything it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.600" end="01:48:09.520" style="s2">just that there you know that it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.840" end="01:48:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s about the individual</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.520" end="01:48:12.560" style="s2">um it&#39;s not about what&#39;s best for the</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.440" end="01:48:14.480" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.560" end="01:48:16.400" style="s2">i agree with that uh i agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.480" end="01:48:19.360" style="s2">entirely um there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.400" end="01:48:20.960" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a biblical</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.360" end="01:48:22.480" style="s2">reference there&#39;s a wis there&#39;s wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.960" end="01:48:24.800" style="s2">and a multitude of counselors</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.480" end="01:48:25.679" style="s2">right and uh brett i actually feel like</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.800" end="01:48:28.800" style="s2">this is somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.679" end="01:48:30.159" style="s2">implicit in in the unity proposal</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.800" end="01:48:32.000" style="s2">because the way in which it</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.159" end="01:48:34.480" style="s2">conceptualizes the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.000" end="01:48:35.679" style="s2">between the candidates is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.480" end="01:48:37.600" style="s2">sort of highly</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.679" end="01:48:38.719" style="s2">consultative at least between the two of</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.600" end="01:48:40.960" style="s2">them but i</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.719" end="01:48:42.320" style="s2">i imagine that if we want to build a</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.960" end="01:48:44.000" style="s2">culture out that</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.320" end="01:48:46.080" style="s2">shifts the tone and tenor of politics</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.000" end="01:48:48.560" style="s2">that it has to be broadly</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.080" end="01:48:49.360" style="s2">collaborative right and so this is why</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.560" end="01:48:52.800" style="s2">loosening</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.360" end="01:48:55.199" style="s2">of the you know of of our being wrapped</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.800" end="01:48:57.920" style="s2">around the partisan axles</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.199" end="01:48:59.280" style="s2">axles is also so necessary right because</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.920" end="01:49:02.000" style="s2">you know that type of</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.280" end="01:49:03.280" style="s2">knee-jerk sort of built-in resistance to</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.000" end="01:49:04.400" style="s2">other points of view</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.280" end="01:49:06.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a word for that it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.400" end="01:49:08.960" style="s2">bigotry right and in addition to it</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.880" end="01:49:12.239" style="s2">being corrosive to relationships</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.960" end="01:49:13.280" style="s2">it therefore also is is is a strong</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.239" end="01:49:16.400" style="s2">impediment</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.280" end="01:49:20.080" style="s2">to um to coordination to learning</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.400" end="01:49:22.000" style="s2">and so um you know um yeah nate</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.080" end="01:49:24.960" style="s2">wise words but hard to swallow in a</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.000" end="01:49:27.280" style="s2">society where everybody is so</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.960" end="01:49:29.040" style="s2">bound and determined to sound smart and</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.280" end="01:49:30.400" style="s2">be right that we can&#39;t sort of create</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.040" end="01:49:32.080" style="s2">the space for</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.400" end="01:49:33.599" style="s2">listening and receiving the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.080" end="01:49:36.480" style="s2">folks who we may</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.599" end="01:49:37.840" style="s2">feel are i don&#39;t know less qualified or</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.480" end="01:49:39.679" style="s2">otherwise perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.840" end="01:49:41.440" style="s2">in the way of all the right answers that</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.679" end="01:49:44.480" style="s2">we have to share</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.440" end="01:49:44.800" style="s2">so i mean sorry go ahead no i was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.480" end="01:49:46.960" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.800" end="01:49:48.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s this this the world we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.960" end="01:49:50.480" style="s2">in right now um</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.480" end="01:49:51.599" style="s2">beyond the political spectrum you know i</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.480" end="01:49:53.199" style="s2">go outside</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.599" end="01:49:54.880" style="s2">and i live in la and you live in l.a</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.199" end="01:49:56.159" style="s2">john too and you so you understand it</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.880" end="01:49:57.920" style="s2">you see it</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.159" end="01:50:00.400" style="s2">this the amount of the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.920" end="01:50:03.440" style="s2">concrete and technology and</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.400" end="01:50:05.440" style="s2">and just the digital world you know and</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.440" end="01:50:06.480" style="s2">access to everything right now right now</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.440" end="01:50:09.360" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.480" end="01:50:10.000" style="s2">uh and just this lack of connection to</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.360" end="01:50:11.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.000" end="01:50:13.599" style="s2">the when i say the real world the</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.760" end="01:50:16.880" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.599" end="01:50:17.440" style="s2">and people as as people as as as human</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.880" end="01:50:20.719" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.440" end="01:50:22.800" style="s2">you know as not as a emojis or</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.719" end="01:50:24.159" style="s2">you know a screen screen handle or</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.800" end="01:50:27.840" style="s2">whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.159" end="01:50:29.520" style="s2">like it is killing us we are killing</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.840" end="01:50:32.320" style="s2">each other by living this way</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.520" end="01:50:33.040" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s it is crept it&#39;s crept</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.320" end="01:50:36.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.040" end="01:50:37.040" style="s2">every facet of life and talk about</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.000" end="01:50:38.719" style="s2">politics i mean this was</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.040" end="01:50:41.679" style="s2">that was probably 2016 was probably the</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.719" end="01:50:46.239" style="s2">first uh at least in my recollection</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.679" end="01:50:48.080" style="s2">the first election that was</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.239" end="01:50:50.239" style="s2">seemed almost purely digital you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.080" end="01:50:51.520" style="s2">what i mean i i understand we had</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.239" end="01:50:52.960" style="s2">debates and then this year they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.520" end="01:50:53.760" style="s2">to be i don&#39;t know how they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.960" end="01:50:55.520" style="s2">do them</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.760" end="01:50:57.040" style="s2">what&#39;s the point exactly as far as</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.520" end="01:50:58.800" style="s2">virtual this and that but</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.040" end="01:51:00.880" style="s2">you know with covet it&#39;s exacerbated</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.800" end="01:51:03.119" style="s2">even more everything is digital now</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.880" end="01:51:04.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s just that there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.119" end="01:51:07.679" style="s2">connection to</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.320" end="01:51:09.119" style="s2">to reality and to you know to the world</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.679" end="01:51:12.639" style="s2">that i think as it was</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.119" end="01:51:15.280" style="s2">intended uh and it does make things</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.639" end="01:51:16.080" style="s2">simpler and easier for people in some</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.280" end="01:51:18.320" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.080" end="01:51:20.400" style="s2">but also greatly complicates and makes</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.320" end="01:51:23.599" style="s2">things incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.400" end="01:51:27.360" style="s2">uh when it comes to uh</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.599" end="01:51:30.239" style="s2">you know i guess just the</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.360" end="01:51:30.639" style="s2">the the connection of one another you</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.239" end="01:51:33.679" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.639" end="01:51:34.480" style="s2">and truly empathizing and truly feeling</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.679" end="01:51:36.320" style="s2">um like</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.480" end="01:51:37.760" style="s2">we are really a part of something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.320" end="01:51:39.360" style="s2">part of something genuine</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.760" end="01:51:40.719" style="s2">and uh and making a difference and</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.360" end="01:51:41.360" style="s2">feeling like we matter in this world</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.719" end="01:51:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.360" end="01:51:44.400" style="s2">getting bigger and bigger and faster and</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.520" end="01:51:45.679" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all trying to play</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.400" end="01:51:47.760" style="s2">catch-up in so</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.679" end="01:51:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a daunting statement there</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.760" end="01:51:50.159" style="s2">um but uh</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.880" end="01:51:52.159" style="s2">you know that&#39;s part of that dramatic</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.159" end="01:51:52.639" style="s2">shift it&#39;s not just in politics i think</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.159" end="01:51:54.639" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.639" end="01:51:56.560" style="s2">in the way that we live our lives right</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.639" end="01:51:59.280" style="s2">well there&#39;s a an aspect of this</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.560" end="01:52:00.080" style="s2">which is you know those questions</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.280" end="01:52:02.880" style="s2">reflect</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.080" end="01:52:03.520" style="s2">the sense that we are hurtling towards</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.880" end="01:52:05.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.520" end="01:52:06.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like we&#39;re on a train and</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.040" end="01:52:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s dawning on us that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.880" end="01:52:11.280" style="s2">nobody banning the the engine and that</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.599" end="01:52:13.360" style="s2">we&#39;re hurtling towards a</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.280" end="01:52:14.960" style="s2">you know the end of the line somehow and</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.360" end="01:52:15.679" style="s2">so people are waking up which is very</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.960" end="01:52:18.400" style="s2">frightening</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.679" end="01:52:19.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s also liberating to discover</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.400" end="01:52:21.440" style="s2">that there are other people awake and</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.760" end="01:52:24.880" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to have that</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.440" end="01:52:27.280" style="s2">mind-numbing conversation but it does</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.880" end="01:52:28.719" style="s2">raise a question for me i think many of</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.280" end="01:52:31.040" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.719" end="01:52:33.280" style="s2">who are uh who have ears to hear this</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.040" end="01:52:35.520" style="s2">conversation are having that</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.280" end="01:52:37.199" style="s2">sense that we are headed towards</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.520" end="01:52:39.679" style="s2">something frightening</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.199" end="01:52:41.760" style="s2">but the conversation we don&#39;t typically</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.679" end="01:52:44.560" style="s2">have is one about the time scale</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.760" end="01:52:45.520" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t know how to phrase the</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.560" end="01:52:48.320" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.520" end="01:52:49.360" style="s2">but maybe we can smith it together what</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.320" end="01:52:53.599" style="s2">i want to know</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.360" end="01:52:56.320" style="s2">is people keep talking to me about</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.599" end="01:52:57.520" style="s2">oh unity2020 that&#39;s a cool idea but how</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.320" end="01:52:58.880" style="s2">about 2024</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.520" end="01:53:01.920" style="s2">you know after we deal with the real</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.880" end="01:53:04.080" style="s2">problem and my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.920" end="01:53:05.360" style="s2">i just wouldn&#39;t bet on us getting to</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.080" end="01:53:07.520" style="s2">2024</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.360" end="01:53:08.560" style="s2">intact in other words there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.520" end="01:53:11.040" style="s2">something but</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.560" end="01:53:11.599" style="s2">um so i guess the question that i want</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.040" end="01:53:14.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.599" end="01:53:16.800" style="s2">want the answer to is what percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.800" end="01:53:20.000" style="s2">the audience has the sense</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.800" end="01:53:23.599" style="s2">that um if we miss</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.000" end="01:53:25.040" style="s2">in 2020 that we should try again in 2024</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.599" end="01:53:26.480" style="s2">that the opportunity will be there and</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.040" end="01:53:30.320" style="s2">what percentage</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.480" end="01:53:31.679" style="s2">um believes that the trajectory we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.320" end="01:53:34.719" style="s2">is so dangerous on</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.679" end="01:53:35.440" style="s2">such a short time scale that uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.719" end="01:53:38.880" style="s2">unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.440" end="01:53:41.119" style="s2">to work awesome</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.880" end="01:53:42.560" style="s2">i will work on formulating that question</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.119" end="01:53:45.280" style="s2">uh before i do</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.560" end="01:53:46.320" style="s2">uh i did want to point out we we asked</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.280" end="01:53:48.880" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.320" end="01:53:51.040" style="s2">of uh of whether there&#39;s things we can</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.880" end="01:53:52.639" style="s2">reach across the aisle and i will admit</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.040" end="01:53:54.320" style="s2">i did not formulate the question quite</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.639" end="01:53:56.239" style="s2">right because the answer was</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.320" end="01:53:57.840" style="s2">yes but i think the question you really</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.239" end="01:53:59.760" style="s2">wanted the answer to is</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.840" end="01:54:00.960" style="s2">can you describe the values that reach</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.760" end="01:54:04.480" style="s2">across the aisle</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.960" end="01:54:07.599" style="s2">um on your screen you should see of</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.480" end="01:54:10.480" style="s2">a bunch of different answers i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.599" end="01:54:12.400" style="s2">sorted by all uh so that&#39;s the priority</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.480" end="01:54:14.400" style="s2">here is the the most agreed to</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.400" end="01:54:16.239" style="s2">answers and then you can see that</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.400" end="01:54:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of agreement between trump</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.239" end="01:54:19.679" style="s2">and biden voters</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.520" end="01:54:21.040" style="s2">do want to point out of course people</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.679" end="01:54:22.719" style="s2">who watch this show</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.040" end="01:54:24.080" style="s2">are not a representative sample of</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.719" end="01:54:25.440" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.080" end="01:54:27.520" style="s2">but the people who are watching this</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.440" end="01:54:28.960" style="s2">show have a lot of agreement around the</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.520" end="01:54:30.320" style="s2">issues that you see on the left hand</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.960" end="01:54:33.119" style="s2">side of this screen</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.320" end="01:54:34.159" style="s2">but what that does signify is that at</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.119" end="01:54:35.520" style="s2">the very least</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.159" end="01:54:38.000" style="s2">we can see that there is this</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.520" end="01:54:40.000" style="s2">cross-section of trump voters inviting</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.000" end="01:54:41.679" style="s2">voters and you know it&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.000" end="01:54:43.199" style="s2">uh to think that if they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.679" end="01:54:45.679" style="s2">converge anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.199" end="01:54:47.199" style="s2">in podcast land you know the darkhorse</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.679" end="01:54:49.440" style="s2">podcast is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.199" end="01:54:50.320" style="s2">likely stopping point right but but</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.440" end="01:54:53.920" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.320" end="01:54:55.199" style="s2">um that&#39;s not that that&#39;s not even uh</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.920" end="01:54:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not disqualifier of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.199" end="01:54:57.840" style="s2">significance of the fact that there</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.480" end="01:55:01.280" style="s2">clearly are</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.840" end="01:55:03.679" style="s2">points at which uh at least you know a</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.280" end="01:55:07.119" style="s2">faction of folks on either side of this</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.679" end="01:55:08.239" style="s2">major uh split in america in american</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.119" end="01:55:10.800" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.239" end="01:55:11.760" style="s2">do see areas of convergence and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.800" end="01:55:13.599" style="s2">willing to bet</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.760" end="01:55:15.199" style="s2">actually in fact i&#39;d stake everything on</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.599" end="01:55:17.520" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.199" end="01:55:19.920" style="s2">that space in which we converge on the</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.520" end="01:55:21.040" style="s2">levels of some more fundamental values</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.920" end="01:55:23.920" style="s2">and objectives</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.040" end="01:55:24.639" style="s2">uh is much bigger than people people</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.920" end="01:55:26.080" style="s2">realize and</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.639" end="01:55:27.760" style="s2">again you know we can go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.080" end="01:55:29.920" style="s2">hidden tribes report</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.760" end="01:55:31.840" style="s2">but you can almost just take it down to</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.920" end="01:55:32.159" style="s2">the very basic fact that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.840" end="01:55:35.440" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.159" end="01:55:36.000" style="s2">human beings who share um we share a</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.440" end="01:55:38.080" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.000" end="01:55:39.679" style="s2">broadly speaking we share a history of</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.080" end="01:55:42.719" style="s2">course they&#39;re radically different</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.679" end="01:55:46.560" style="s2">you know streams in that that history</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.719" end="01:55:49.360" style="s2">different avenues of experience um but</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.560" end="01:55:50.719" style="s2">you know there is a way in which i think</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.360" end="01:55:51.599" style="s2">it would be hard for any of us to</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.719" end="01:55:54.719" style="s2">conceive</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.599" end="01:55:56.719" style="s2">of a fulfilling and happy</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.719" end="01:55:57.840" style="s2">life and a fulfilling and happy society</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.719" end="01:56:00.880" style="s2">which was not also</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.840" end="01:56:01.440" style="s2">maximizing the goods of liberty the</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.880" end="01:56:04.159" style="s2">goods</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.440" end="01:56:04.800" style="s2">of justice or material goods like</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.159" end="01:56:08.239" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.800" end="01:56:09.520" style="s2">economic opportunity and i think you</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.239" end="01:56:11.040" style="s2">would also be hard-pressed to find</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.520" end="01:56:12.719" style="s2">americans who don&#39;t have a basic sense</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.040" end="01:56:13.119" style="s2">of the fact that to safeguard those</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.719" end="01:56:15.280" style="s2">goods</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.119" end="01:56:16.800" style="s2">and those values we have to treat each</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.280" end="01:56:19.280" style="s2">other and interact with each other</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.800" end="01:56:21.040" style="s2">in a certain way and so you know it</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.280" end="01:56:23.199" style="s2">really takes a lot of work to pull us</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.040" end="01:56:24.800" style="s2">away from that basic consensus</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.199" end="01:56:26.320" style="s2">but the polarizing establishments are</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.800" end="01:56:29.599" style="s2">doing a lot of work so</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.320" end="01:56:32.719" style="s2">we&#39;re in the situation we&#39;re in but that</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.599" end="01:56:33.679" style="s2">that compels me to be hopeful uh in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.719" end="01:56:35.520" style="s2">final analysis</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.679" end="01:56:37.760" style="s2">the time frame question not not the</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.520" end="01:56:40.400" style="s2">standing uh brett because i</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.760" end="01:56:40.960" style="s2">i see the urgency there um but i do</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.400" end="01:56:42.080" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.960" end="01:56:44.000" style="s2">that just to speak to that really</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.080" end="01:56:45.679" style="s2">quickly you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.000" end="01:56:47.920" style="s2">my general sense is always that we need</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.679" end="01:56:48.800" style="s2">to do as much as we can today without</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.920" end="01:56:51.679" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.800" end="01:56:52.239" style="s2">um foregoing the need to plan for</p>

<p begin="01:56:52.239" end="01:56:55.520" style="s2">right and to the extent to which we can</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.719" end="01:56:57.920" style="s2">maximize</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.520" end="01:57:00.480" style="s2">both of those things you know i see</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.920" end="01:57:00.800" style="s2">success for unity 2020 obviously you</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.480" end="01:57:03.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.800" end="01:57:05.040" style="s2">the highest marker of success would be</p>

<p begin="01:57:05.040" end="01:57:08.239" style="s2">that&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.000" end="01:57:09.520" style="s2">to inspire the american people towards</p>

<p begin="01:57:12.239" end="01:57:15.840" style="s2">you know on the top level and that would</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.000" end="01:57:17.679" style="s2">be amazing and i think that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.840" end="01:57:20.000" style="s2">give up hope at the idea that that scale</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.679" end="01:57:21.599" style="s2">of change is possible while also</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.000" end="01:57:23.840" style="s2">committing to the fact that even if that</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.599" end="01:57:24.560" style="s2">was accomplished the most important</p>

<p begin="01:57:48.880" end="01:57:54.239" style="s2">that work uh can be successful uh</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.400" end="01:57:56.159" style="s2">regardless of who wins the presidential</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.239" end="01:57:58.639" style="s2">election even as we pursue</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.159" end="01:57:59.360" style="s2">change at the highest level um all of</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.639" end="01:58:01.520" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.360" end="01:58:03.199" style="s2">i think are a part of this of this</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.520" end="01:58:05.040" style="s2">larger wave of change</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.199" end="01:58:06.639" style="s2">that i do think is going to prove itself</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.040" end="01:58:09.280" style="s2">to be successful</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.639" end="01:58:10.800" style="s2">as we adapt to the challenges at hand um</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.280" end="01:58:13.840" style="s2">you know this year and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.800" end="01:58:17.280" style="s2">100 agree that basically yes</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.840" end="01:58:20.400" style="s2">we have a um a plan</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.280" end="01:58:21.679" style="s2">for a rapid fix or a fix that would</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.400" end="01:58:24.639" style="s2">begin rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.679" end="01:58:25.360" style="s2">but whether or not that plan succeeds</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.639" end="01:58:28.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.360" end="01:58:30.960" style="s2">waking people up to what we are losing</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.480" end="01:58:31.760" style="s2">in this polarization such that they are</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.960" end="01:58:34.320" style="s2">prepared</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.760" end="01:58:35.280" style="s2">irrespective of what comes is is work</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.320" end="01:58:38.239" style="s2">that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.280" end="01:58:40.159" style="s2">so um i guess maybe part of the reason</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.239" end="01:58:41.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s formulated the way it is</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.159" end="01:58:44.000" style="s2">is that one doesn&#39;t have to choose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.920" end="01:58:46.960" style="s2">the right direction irrespective of</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.000" end="01:58:48.880" style="s2">which mechanism or both mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.960" end="01:58:52.159" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.880" end="01:58:54.239" style="s2">so go ahead and spot data for john</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.159" end="01:58:56.560" style="s2">uh as he talked about the ways where the</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.239" end="01:58:59.599" style="s2">same but now i&#39;ve switched over to</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.560" end="01:59:01.040" style="s2">your uh polling question brett so i i</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.599" end="01:59:02.880" style="s2">tried to phrase these as best as</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.040" end="01:59:04.880" style="s2">possible but you should see some results</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.880" end="01:59:07.280" style="s2">on screen um</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.880" end="01:59:09.040" style="s2">so 158 people answered this question</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.280" end="01:59:11.280" style="s2">which is should give us some confidence</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.040" end="01:59:14.840" style="s2">that this represents unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.280" end="01:59:17.840" style="s2">um can you see the the answers</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.840" end="01:59:17.840" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.320" end="01:59:24.719" style="s2">okay um can we get to you showed some</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.679" end="01:59:28.480" style="s2">uh data about who is interested</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.719" end="01:59:29.760" style="s2">in unity 2020 uh during the break here i</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.480" end="01:59:32.880" style="s2">thought it was very</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.760" end="01:59:34.560" style="s2">interesting um yeah well actually uh one</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.880" end="01:59:36.000" style="s2">of the things uh that that we were</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.560" end="01:59:36.800" style="s2">exploring i think everybody here has</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.000" end="01:59:39.199" style="s2">spoken to</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.800" end="01:59:40.239" style="s2">the moment that brought them to unity</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.199" end="01:59:43.920" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.239" end="01:59:46.080" style="s2">um so the question that we asked was to</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.920" end="01:59:46.400" style="s2">explain an experience that kind of got</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.080" end="01:59:48.239" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.400" end="01:59:49.599" style="s2">here um and i&#39;m just scrolling through</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.239" end="01:59:52.880" style="s2">and searching for that</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.599" end="01:59:54.320" style="s2">um and uh and i&#39;m gonna bring that up in</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.880" end="01:59:56.400" style="s2">a second and talk you through</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.320" end="01:59:57.360" style="s2">through that i believe that&#39;s right up</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.400" end="01:59:59.920" style="s2">here um</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.360" end="02:00:02.159" style="s2">great so the question we asked is uh can</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.920" end="02:00:02.880" style="s2">you describe the moment or experience</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.159" end="02:00:05.119" style="s2">that most</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.880" end="02:00:06.639" style="s2">piqued your interest in the ideas of</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.119" end="02:00:09.679" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.639" end="02:00:10.960" style="s2">that unity 2020 represents um and now we</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.679" end="02:00:12.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t ask people to</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.960" end="02:00:14.719" style="s2">since this is a personal experience what</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.960" end="02:00:17.199" style="s2">we then ask people to do</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.719" end="02:00:18.480" style="s2">is is to categorize how they would see</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.199" end="02:00:21.040" style="s2">that experience</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.480" end="02:00:21.760" style="s2">so we can click in here on on the screen</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.040" end="02:00:24.239" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.760" end="02:00:25.760" style="s2">um say this and i thought brett this was</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.239" end="02:00:28.880" style="s2">really cool um</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.760" end="02:00:31.199" style="s2">you may be making new voters uh</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.880" end="02:00:33.360" style="s2">one of the answers verbatim that people</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.199" end="02:00:34.320" style="s2">said is what brought them to 2020 is</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.360" end="02:00:36.639" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.320" end="02:00:38.719" style="s2">on joe rogan podcast i&#39;m considering</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.639" end="02:00:40.639" style="s2">voting for the first time in my life</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.719" end="02:00:44.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve never felt like it was more</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.639" end="02:00:46.239" style="s2">important that i stand up and speak</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.159" end="02:00:47.199" style="s2">so i got to tell you this gives me</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.239" end="02:00:49.920" style="s2">chills a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.199" end="02:00:51.280" style="s2">and it also is reflected in the data</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.920" end="02:00:54.480" style="s2">that we collected</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.280" end="02:00:56.400" style="s2">on our 1500</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.480" end="02:00:57.679" style="s2">volunteers who took a survey as they</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.400" end="02:01:00.719" style="s2">came through the door</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.679" end="02:01:02.480" style="s2">and a number of things were in that one</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.719" end="02:01:04.960" style="s2">was that the</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.480" end="02:01:06.480" style="s2">source populations were about evenly</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.960" end="02:01:07.920" style="s2">divided between people who</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.480" end="02:01:10.239" style="s2">would have supported trump and people</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.920" end="02:01:12.159" style="s2">who would have supported biden</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.239" end="02:01:13.840" style="s2">with a slightly larger number coming</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.159" end="02:01:15.599" style="s2">from the trump side</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.840" end="02:01:17.679" style="s2">but a large number something like a</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.599" end="02:01:19.840" style="s2">quarter if i&#39;m recalling correctly</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.679" end="02:01:20.719" style="s2">were drawn from people who were not</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.840" end="02:01:22.400" style="s2">planning to vote</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.719" end="02:01:23.840" style="s2">otherwise and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.400" end="02:01:26.000" style="s2">has been true about our</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.840" end="02:01:28.080" style="s2">political system is that it drives</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.000" end="02:01:30.719" style="s2">people away and it doesn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.080" end="02:01:32.080" style="s2">right if it alienates people out but it</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.719" end="02:01:35.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change who wins</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.080" end="02:01:37.119" style="s2">the power that is won is the same</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.119" end="02:01:39.679" style="s2">the legitimacy of that power is reduced</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.119" end="02:01:41.679" style="s2">when people are driven away from voting</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.679" end="02:01:42.880" style="s2">but the amount of power that&#39;s divided</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.679" end="02:01:45.119" style="s2">and peddled</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.880" end="02:01:47.360" style="s2">is the same and so the idea that unity</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.119" end="02:01:48.480" style="s2">2020 is actually bringing a significant</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.360" end="02:01:51.280" style="s2">number of voters</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.480" end="02:01:51.599" style="s2">back into the fold because again they</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.280" end="02:01:54.960" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.599" end="02:01:57.440" style="s2">something worth their consideration</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.960" end="02:01:58.880" style="s2">is extremely heartening and so for all</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.440" end="02:02:00.480" style="s2">of the people who say</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.880" end="02:02:02.239" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t do this you&#39;ll spoil</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.480" end="02:02:03.040" style="s2">the election a it appears that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.239" end="02:02:05.040" style="s2">not the case</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.040" end="02:02:07.040" style="s2">based on the split between the different</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.040" end="02:02:10.080" style="s2">types of voters who are arriving</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.040" end="02:02:10.719" style="s2">right very evenly split but the new</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.080" end="02:02:12.639" style="s2">voters</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.719" end="02:02:14.480" style="s2">that are being brought back are a</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.639" end="02:02:16.880" style="s2">dividend on this plan</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.480" end="02:02:18.960" style="s2">that i must say i wouldn&#39;t have dared</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.880" end="02:02:21.119" style="s2">hope for at this level</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.960" end="02:02:23.119" style="s2">to the extent that anything re-energizes</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.119" end="02:02:26.560" style="s2">people and brings them back</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.119" end="02:02:28.000" style="s2">into the active role of citizens</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.560" end="02:02:31.199" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a very good thing and it</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.000" end="02:02:34.400" style="s2">really has has spurred us on</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.199" end="02:02:36.000" style="s2">so here we see some poll results</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.400" end="02:02:37.679" style="s2">this is data that just supports what you</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.000" end="02:02:40.159" style="s2">said we asked a thousand</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.679" end="02:02:40.800" style="s2">a thousand people were responding um</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.159" end="02:02:43.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.800" end="02:02:44.000" style="s2">twenty percent biden twenty six percent</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.360" end="02:02:45.760" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.000" end="02:02:47.360" style="s2">these are these are would would-be biden</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.760" end="02:02:48.639" style="s2">and would-be trump voters who are</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.360" end="02:02:52.239" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.639" end="02:02:52.960" style="s2">unity 2020 yes exactly uh who are you</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.239" end="02:02:55.679" style="s2">planning on</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.960" end="02:02:56.800" style="s2">voting for before you found out about</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.679" end="02:02:59.040" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.800" end="02:03:00.880" style="s2">and what you&#39;re speaking to here are the</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.040" end="02:03:02.159" style="s2">12 percent that we&#39;re planning on not</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.880" end="02:03:04.480" style="s2">voting for president</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.159" end="02:03:05.520" style="s2">the 13 that we&#39;re going to write in a</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.480" end="02:03:07.520" style="s2">vote um</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.520" end="02:03:09.280" style="s2">not voting at all can cover a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.520" end="02:03:12.000" style="s2">different reasons from them being</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.280" end="02:03:14.080" style="s2">a felon and not able to vote to living</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.000" end="02:03:16.320" style="s2">in a u.s territory that that</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.080" end="02:03:17.199" style="s2">may not allow voting to being under the</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.320" end="02:03:19.119" style="s2">age of 18</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.199" end="02:03:20.560" style="s2">but this is an enormous of number which</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.119" end="02:03:23.199" style="s2">i think is is</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.560" end="02:03:24.960" style="s2">that 12 and that 16 these are people</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.199" end="02:03:26.560" style="s2">engaged enough to be paying attention to</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.960" end="02:03:29.920" style="s2">unity 2020 which</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.560" end="02:03:32.480" style="s2">seems unlikely if they&#39;re just simply</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.920" end="02:03:33.840" style="s2">not eligible to be voting we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.480" end="02:03:35.199" style="s2">who these people are what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.840" end="02:03:37.280" style="s2">responding to but nonetheless it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.199" end="02:03:38.639" style="s2">large number of people who in one</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.280" end="02:03:40.960" style="s2">category or the other</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.639" end="02:03:42.880" style="s2">12 percent of the thousand and 16</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.960" end="02:03:44.159" style="s2">percent were either not voting or not</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.880" end="02:03:45.520" style="s2">voting for president</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.159" end="02:03:47.679" style="s2">and then amongst the people who were</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.520" end="02:03:49.679" style="s2">committed to major party candidates</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.679" end="02:03:51.360" style="s2">twenty percent are would be biden voters</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.679" end="02:03:52.239" style="s2">twenty six percent are would be trump</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.360" end="02:03:55.360" style="s2">voters</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.239" end="02:03:58.320" style="s2">so anyway uh this says that</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.360" end="02:03:59.119" style="s2">a these things are evenly divided pretty</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.320" end="02:04:02.079" style="s2">evenly</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.119" end="02:04:03.679" style="s2">and b that to the extent that they are</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.079" end="02:04:05.199" style="s2">drawing more from one side or the other</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.679" end="02:04:06.560" style="s2">they&#39;re drawing more away from trump</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.199" end="02:04:08.800" style="s2">than they are from biden</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.560" end="02:04:10.239" style="s2">so i think that that really belongs in</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.800" end="02:04:11.920" style="s2">people&#39;s mindset</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.239" end="02:04:14.000" style="s2">the fact that we have now seen that in</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.920" end="02:04:16.400" style="s2">multiple data sets</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.000" end="02:04:18.159" style="s2">uh as people consider whether or not we</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.400" end="02:04:21.199" style="s2">should be engaged in unity 2020 they</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.159" end="02:04:21.199" style="s2">should be thinking about that</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.400" end="02:04:26.159" style="s2">all right what else do you have for us</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.880" end="02:04:29.199" style="s2">noah</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.159" end="02:04:30.400" style="s2">um well let&#39;s uh let&#39;s see uh first of</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.199" end="02:04:31.920" style="s2">all let&#39;s ask our guests</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.400" end="02:04:33.840" style="s2">uh is there are there some other</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.920" end="02:04:36.400" style="s2">questions we should fire off</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.840" end="02:04:38.000" style="s2">um and if not i i do wonder if we can</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.400" end="02:04:41.119" style="s2">look a little more closely at the</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.000" end="02:04:41.440" style="s2">the potential uh areas of agreement here</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.119" end="02:04:43.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.440" end="02:04:44.639" style="s2">uh did either of you have anything you</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.040" end="02:04:46.159" style="s2">want us to ask right now and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.639" end="02:04:47.760" style="s2">going to put up on screen here</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.159" end="02:04:49.199" style="s2">is i&#39;m going to start sorting let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.760" end="02:04:52.239" style="s2">let&#39;s sort by trump voters</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.199" end="02:04:54.079" style="s2">and see what can you describe one value</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.239" end="02:04:56.960" style="s2">that reaches across the aisle</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.079" end="02:04:58.480" style="s2">um and and and you can see that the what</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.960" end="02:05:00.560" style="s2">trump voters think reaches across the</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.480" end="02:05:01.760" style="s2">aisle reaches across for by denial uh</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.560" end="02:05:03.520" style="s2">and that the top issue is actually</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.760" end="02:05:04.239" style="s2">college education and education in</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.520" end="02:05:06.560" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.239" end="02:05:08.159" style="s2">um so but let&#39;s break this down first of</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.560" end="02:05:10.880" style="s2">all john nate do you have a question we</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.159" end="02:05:15.679" style="s2">should fire off to people</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.880" end="02:05:18.079" style="s2">um yeah i do</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.679" end="02:05:19.040" style="s2">do we feel this is a very general</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.079" end="02:05:22.320" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.040" end="02:05:24.560" style="s2">do we feel hopeful about the future of</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.320" end="02:05:26.960" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.560" end="02:05:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very very general all right we do</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.960" end="02:05:30.880" style="s2">do we do we genuinely feel hope</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.040" end="02:05:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a good one all right and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.440" end="02:05:36.880" style="s2">gonna ask people uh</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.880" end="02:05:38.880" style="s2">to describe why or why not all right so</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.880" end="02:05:41.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll get some some good data there</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.880" end="02:05:43.599" style="s2">um i imagine you might have a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.920" end="02:05:45.760" style="s2">people who might be tempted to say</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.599" end="02:05:47.199" style="s2">both because a lot of times that is kind</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.760" end="02:05:48.800" style="s2">of the real sort of thing there are</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.199" end="02:05:50.480" style="s2">things that give us hope</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.800" end="02:05:52.000" style="s2">and there are things that make us</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.480" end="02:05:54.239" style="s2">pessimistic right</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.000" end="02:05:56.320" style="s2">but in any event i&#39;ll be i&#39;ll be uh</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.239" end="02:05:59.760" style="s2">interested to hear that hear the spread</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.320" end="02:06:02.159" style="s2">well here&#39;s a question uh the pollster</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.760" end="02:06:03.280" style="s2">uh would say the options are yes the</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.159" end="02:06:05.119" style="s2">other and</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.280" end="02:06:06.320" style="s2">no but should we put a third option</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.119" end="02:06:09.679" style="s2">which is uh</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.320" end="02:06:11.280" style="s2">depends on the day yeah what about what</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.679" end="02:06:12.639" style="s2">about what about a little speak to the</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.280" end="02:06:15.040" style="s2">question do we feel hopeful about the</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.639" end="02:06:17.360" style="s2">future of the unity of america</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.040" end="02:06:18.719" style="s2">i think that that is a little more</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.360" end="02:06:20.320" style="s2">pointed and it&#39;s more what i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.719" end="02:06:23.360" style="s2">alluding to</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.320" end="02:06:24.639" style="s2">interesting right yeah all right because</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.360" end="02:06:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s felt like it in my</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.639" end="02:06:28.639" style="s2">you know past i mean i think september</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.920" end="02:06:32.079" style="s2">12th</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.639" end="02:06:33.760" style="s2">uh 2001 was a very unified day</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.079" end="02:06:35.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve had other moments like that seems</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.760" end="02:06:37.840" style="s2">like a lot having to do with disasters</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.840" end="02:06:40.800" style="s2">whether they&#39;re natural or</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.840" end="02:06:42.400" style="s2">or otherwise and then we seem to come</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.800" end="02:06:44.320" style="s2">together in those times</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.400" end="02:06:45.840" style="s2">for the most part it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.320" end="02:06:49.119" style="s2">lessening</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.840" end="02:06:51.920" style="s2">here more and more but uh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.119" end="02:06:54.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of what i&#39;m alluding to</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.920" end="02:06:56.000" style="s2">yeah</p>

<p begin="02:06:56.000" end="02:06:59.840" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re really split</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.119" end="02:07:07.679" style="s2">this is by by likely voter</p>

<p begin="02:07:07.679" end="02:07:11.920" style="s2">to even</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.639" end="02:07:13.119" style="s2">uh so you can interpret that a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.920" end="02:07:16.239" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.119" end="02:07:18.800" style="s2">yeah all right so i&#39;d i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.239" end="02:07:19.920" style="s2">get some information in talking to</p>

<p begin="02:07:38.960" end="02:07:42.719" style="s2">diversity of thought in their friend</p>

<p begin="02:09:11.119" end="02:09:14.639" style="s2">to to get real data on that and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.079" end="02:09:16.320" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.639" end="02:09:18.079" style="s2">are you aware of data like that has more</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.320" end="02:09:19.840" style="s2">in common done that kind of research</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.079" end="02:09:22.000" style="s2">where we analyze you know what</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.840" end="02:09:25.360" style="s2">percentage of the american people</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.000" end="02:09:29.199" style="s2">are in a are networked in a way to where</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.360" end="02:09:31.599" style="s2">90 upwards of 90 95 or so</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.199" end="02:09:33.040" style="s2">of their meaningful social relationships</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.599" end="02:09:34.079" style="s2">are with people who think the way they</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.040" end="02:09:36.800" style="s2">do politically</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.079" end="02:09:37.280" style="s2">and how many have some substantial you</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.800" end="02:09:40.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.280" end="02:09:41.679" style="s2">number of relationships with people who</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.400" end="02:09:44.000" style="s2">differ within that way</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.679" end="02:09:46.880" style="s2">is there data on that as far as you know</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.000" end="02:09:48.880" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know it seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.880" end="02:09:51.199" style="s2">essential that there would be data</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.880" end="02:09:51.920" style="s2">because just what we&#39;re seeing play out</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.199" end="02:09:54.880" style="s2">plays out</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.920" end="02:09:56.320" style="s2">so differently if you know if you you</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.880" end="02:09:57.840" style="s2">know and i think actually this goes to</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.320" end="02:10:00.159" style="s2">something that nate was saying</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.840" end="02:10:01.119" style="s2">about the military right the military</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.159" end="02:10:04.480" style="s2">forces you</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.119" end="02:10:07.360" style="s2">into collaboration with people who are</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.480" end="02:10:07.679" style="s2">across a wide spectrum now it may not be</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.360" end="02:10:09.840" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.679" end="02:10:10.960" style="s2">wide as it might be it may borrow more</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.840" end="02:10:12.719" style="s2">from some parts of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.960" end="02:10:15.440" style="s2">political spectrum than others but it</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.719" end="02:10:19.599" style="s2">cuts across racial lines it cuts across</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.440" end="02:10:22.480" style="s2">class lines and um</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.599" end="02:10:24.159" style="s2">the necessity of understanding somebody</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.480" end="02:10:29.360" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t just decide</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.159" end="02:10:31.360" style="s2">um that somebody who&#39;s in your unit</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.360" end="02:10:32.719" style="s2">is a terrible person and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.360" end="02:10:33.440" style="s2">going to collaborate with them it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.719" end="02:10:35.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.440" end="02:10:37.280" style="s2">the structure negates that so you have</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.520" end="02:10:40.800" style="s2">to find the humanity in other people</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.280" end="02:10:42.880" style="s2">in order to make it work and um</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.800" end="02:10:44.239" style="s2">so in any case there are a small number</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.880" end="02:10:46.560" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.239" end="02:10:47.920" style="s2">in society that force you into that kind</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.560" end="02:10:51.119" style="s2">of contact</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.920" end="02:10:53.360" style="s2">and a large number that don&#39;t and my my</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.119" end="02:10:55.199" style="s2">fear is that most people are surrounded</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.360" end="02:10:56.719" style="s2">by people who agree with them so much</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.199" end="02:10:58.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s very easy for them to fall</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.719" end="02:11:01.599" style="s2">into this echo chamber thing</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.800" end="02:11:03.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s much it&#39;s much harder if um</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.599" end="02:11:05.679" style="s2">something about your day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.520" end="02:11:06.639" style="s2">just simply violates those boundaries</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.679" end="02:11:09.760" style="s2">well and the thing is</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.639" end="02:11:11.440" style="s2">is the more the trends of polarization</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.760" end="02:11:13.520" style="s2">increase the more they will increase</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.440" end="02:11:16.639" style="s2">right because suddenly when you have</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.520" end="02:11:18.800" style="s2">to pay a social price for being</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.639" end="02:11:20.960" style="s2">of a minority point of view then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.800" end="02:11:21.760" style="s2">going to see solace and refuge with</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.960" end="02:11:22.960" style="s2">folks who</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.760" end="02:11:25.360" style="s2">agree with you right which means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.960" end="02:11:28.079" style="s2">going to vacate those spaces that would</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.360" end="02:11:30.000" style="s2">otherwise be ideologically integrated</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.079" end="02:11:31.440" style="s2">and i think i may have seen some data</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.000" end="02:11:33.199" style="s2">somewhere along the way to suggest that</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.440" end="02:11:34.320" style="s2">there&#39;s even a geographical sorting</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.199" end="02:11:36.639" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.320" end="02:11:38.000" style="s2">taken place in that way where people are</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.639" end="02:11:40.000" style="s2">moving to places</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.000" end="02:11:41.920" style="s2">in part on the basis of wanting to be</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.000" end="02:11:43.599" style="s2">around folks with whom their</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.920" end="02:11:45.760" style="s2">politics the surrounding politics can</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.599" end="02:11:48.639" style="s2">allow them to feel socially safe</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.760" end="02:11:49.840" style="s2">right so i i i can&#39;t recall where i may</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.639" end="02:11:52.000" style="s2">have seen</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.840" end="02:11:53.280" style="s2">any of that but any of that data but it</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.000" end="02:11:55.520" style="s2">may be out there</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.280" end="02:11:57.599" style="s2">so yeah but we can we can imagine that</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.520" end="02:12:00.400" style="s2">this is this pattern is</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.599" end="02:12:01.199" style="s2">probably real and probably accelerating</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.400" end="02:12:03.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.199" end="02:12:05.679" style="s2">by and large which is why building up</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.760" end="02:12:07.040" style="s2">the counter forces to allow that trend</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.679" end="02:12:09.119" style="s2">to go in the other direction</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.040" end="02:12:10.079" style="s2">is important which is exactly what we</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.119" end="02:12:12.880" style="s2">are doing here</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.079" end="02:12:13.520" style="s2">exactly now i&#39;ve been having a weird</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.880" end="02:12:15.840" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.520" end="02:12:17.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve been uh trying to do as much biking</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.840" end="02:12:18.320" style="s2">as i can while the sun is still shining</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.520" end="02:12:20.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.320" end="02:12:22.639" style="s2">winter is coming as i keep trying to</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.000" end="02:12:25.280" style="s2">remind my various viewers but</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.639" end="02:12:27.119" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve been looking at these signs</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.280" end="02:12:30.159" style="s2">that people are putting in their windows</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.119" end="02:12:31.840" style="s2">and on their lawns and things and</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.159" end="02:12:33.679" style="s2">you know a lot of it is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.840" end="02:12:36.000" style="s2">would expect you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.679" end="02:12:37.199" style="s2">very standard black lives matter stuff</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.000" end="02:12:39.760" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.199" end="02:12:41.199" style="s2">this class of sign that attempts to make</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.760" end="02:12:44.159" style="s2">a different point</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.199" end="02:12:44.639" style="s2">so a sign will very often start out with</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.159" end="02:12:46.400" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.639" end="02:12:48.239" style="s2">black lives matter and then it will go</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.400" end="02:12:51.040" style="s2">on to say something about</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.239" end="02:12:52.000" style="s2">science is very important right</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.040" end="02:12:55.360" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.000" end="02:12:56.400" style="s2">and one has the sense that i mean i</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.360" end="02:12:58.079" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine that</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.400" end="02:12:59.599" style="s2">americans have ever accomplished very</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.079" end="02:13:02.400" style="s2">much by dialoguing through</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.599" end="02:13:04.159" style="s2">bumper stickers or whatever they do but</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.400" end="02:13:04.560" style="s2">nonetheless there&#39;s an attempt to figure</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.159" end="02:13:07.360" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.560" end="02:13:09.679" style="s2">how you can say something so that it can</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.360" end="02:13:11.920" style="s2">be heard across a divide</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.679" end="02:13:13.679" style="s2">right the entire the idea that black</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.920" end="02:13:16.000" style="s2">lives matter is synonymous with</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.679" end="02:13:17.119" style="s2">um science as white supremacist is</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.000" end="02:13:20.320" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.119" end="02:13:23.840" style="s2">right so the attempt to</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.320" end="02:13:25.679" style="s2">deliver a message that contains</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.840" end="02:13:28.400" style="s2">you know both something that you have to</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.679" end="02:13:31.520" style="s2">say and some nuance that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.400" end="02:13:35.760" style="s2">to get across the divide i find hopeful</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.520" end="02:13:39.040" style="s2">i guess right yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.760" end="02:13:42.960" style="s2">yeah well people who are interested in</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.040" end="02:13:45.679" style="s2">brokering um one more functional</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.960" end="02:13:46.880" style="s2">you know social relationships and two of</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.679" end="02:13:48.400" style="s2">better politics</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.880" end="02:13:50.159" style="s2">are interested in the project of</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.400" end="02:13:51.360" style="s2">figuring out how do you frame things so</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.159" end="02:13:53.679" style="s2">as to accomplish</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.360" end="02:13:55.840" style="s2">precisely that and so that juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.679" end="02:13:58.800" style="s2">which you identify is probably</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.840" end="02:14:00.000" style="s2">a signal of somebody tried to do that</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.800" end="02:14:01.679" style="s2">that work</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.000" end="02:14:03.840" style="s2">nate i&#39;m wondering if you have uh</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.679" end="02:14:05.920" style="s2">particular tactics or</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.840" end="02:14:07.280" style="s2">tech techniques or i mean you&#39;re such an</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.920" end="02:14:08.800" style="s2">earnest guy man</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.280" end="02:14:10.560" style="s2">but i&#39;m just wondering if there are</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.800" end="02:14:12.079" style="s2">things that you&#39;ve learned along the way</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.560" end="02:14:13.840" style="s2">in terms of how you</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.079" end="02:14:15.199" style="s2">go about communicating these different</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.840" end="02:14:17.599" style="s2">directions that</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.199" end="02:14:18.800" style="s2">that come to mind they come to your mind</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.599" end="02:14:20.239" style="s2">as things you might be able to share</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.800" end="02:14:23.920" style="s2">with some of the folks</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.239" end="02:14:25.520" style="s2">listening to us here i just copy people</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.920" end="02:14:27.199" style="s2">that i respect</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.520" end="02:14:28.800" style="s2">none of them are my own ideas i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.199" end="02:14:31.360" style="s2">original you know</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.800" end="02:14:32.159" style="s2">uh there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.360" end="02:14:33.679" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.159" end="02:14:35.280" style="s2">conduct themselves in a way that</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.679" end="02:14:36.560" style="s2">impresses me and you know and</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.280" end="02:14:39.599" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got their there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.560" end="02:14:40.239" style="s2">not everybody has all of those qualities</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.599" end="02:14:42.000" style="s2">uh but</p>

<p begin="02:14:42.000" end="02:14:46.960" style="s2">well and uh</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.760" end="02:14:49.679" style="s2">in my opinion and so i i try to</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.960" end="02:14:50.320" style="s2">i try to emulate that as much as i can</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.679" end="02:14:52.159" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.320" end="02:14:54.000" style="s2">i try to do i try to do a really</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.159" end="02:14:56.800" style="s2">conscious job</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.000" end="02:14:58.800" style="s2">of of listening because i have that</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.800" end="02:15:00.480" style="s2">personal impulse as a lot of us do</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.800" end="02:15:01.840" style="s2">i think anybody that feels like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.480" end="02:15:04.000" style="s2">a generally</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.840" end="02:15:05.360" style="s2">somewhat intelligent person we have this</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.000" end="02:15:08.239" style="s2">impulse of like</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.360" end="02:15:09.520" style="s2">you know we we want to piggyback back</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.239" end="02:15:11.760" style="s2">off this idea or</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.520" end="02:15:12.560" style="s2">like you know maybe we have a counter</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.760" end="02:15:15.280" style="s2">argument like</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.560" end="02:15:16.800" style="s2">we have that that urge to just to</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.280" end="02:15:17.119" style="s2">definitely say something you know to</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.800" end="02:15:20.320" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.119" end="02:15:21.679" style="s2">in and make sure that um it&#39;s validating</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.320" end="02:15:22.400" style="s2">us for ourselves you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.679" end="02:15:24.960" style="s2">validated</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.400" end="02:15:25.599" style="s2">we could validate that person as well um</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.960" end="02:15:27.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.599" end="02:15:29.679" style="s2">contribute to that conversation in some</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.440" end="02:15:32.400" style="s2">way and sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.679" end="02:15:34.159" style="s2">uh it&#39;s just not necessary and uh you</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.400" end="02:15:36.560" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.159" end="02:15:40.000" style="s2">artists that i&#39;ve listened to that</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.560" end="02:15:44.079" style="s2">are incredibly smart they have this</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.000" end="02:15:46.159" style="s2">this great presence about them um yet</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.079" end="02:15:48.079" style="s2">they&#39;re you know their their their main</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.159" end="02:15:49.679" style="s2">currencies are silence and stillness you</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.079" end="02:15:50.960" style="s2">know and i watch those people and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.679" end="02:15:53.280" style="s2">just like wow</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.960" end="02:15:54.800" style="s2">that person is engaged that person could</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.280" end="02:15:56.239" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.800" end="02:15:57.599" style="s2">run circles around everybody else in</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.239" end="02:15:58.320" style="s2">this room if they wanted to but they</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.599" end="02:16:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.320" end="02:16:04.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s just that uh i think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.920" end="02:16:05.760" style="s2">bad humility that really inspires me and</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.320" end="02:16:06.480" style="s2">i keep going back to humility but i</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.760" end="02:16:09.199" style="s2">think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.480" end="02:16:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lost art and uh it does</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.199" end="02:16:12.960" style="s2">motivate me and it does uh</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.960" end="02:16:15.360" style="s2">it does make me want to follow you know</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.960" end="02:16:17.840" style="s2">i i think i think</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.360" end="02:16:19.760" style="s2">good leaders are are great followers too</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.840" end="02:16:21.119" style="s2">because you don&#39;t always have to take</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.760" end="02:16:22.000" style="s2">the torch you don&#39;t always have to be in</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.119" end="02:16:23.119" style="s2">the front</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.000" end="02:16:24.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re a good leader you know</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.119" end="02:16:25.520" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s better that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.400" end="02:16:27.360" style="s2">and you let</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.520" end="02:16:28.639" style="s2">you know you let your tribe lead the way</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.360" end="02:16:32.319" style="s2">and empower them</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.639" end="02:16:34.399" style="s2">so those type of things i just i try to</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.319" end="02:16:36.639" style="s2">do and i fail every day</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.399" end="02:16:37.599" style="s2">you know i screw up and i and i put my</p>
<p begin="02:16:36.639" end="02:16:40.719" style="s2">foot on my mouth and i get</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.599" end="02:16:42.240" style="s2">so amped up and pissed off and whatever</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.719" end="02:16:43.840" style="s2">about things and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.240" end="02:16:46.479" style="s2">i try to be conscious about that because</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.840" end="02:16:49.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t fix anything just pure anger</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.479" end="02:16:50.880" style="s2">and uh and debate you know uh doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.760" end="02:16:54.399" style="s2">really fix anything</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.880" end="02:16:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s action um and being very</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.399" end="02:16:58.559" style="s2">deliberate about your responses and and</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.040" end="02:17:01.040" style="s2">not letting yourself get too comfortable</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.559" end="02:17:03.840" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing like i i</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.040" end="02:17:05.120" style="s2">i i&#39;ve done a good job in my past at</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.840" end="02:17:06.639" style="s2">challenging myself a lot of them have</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.120" end="02:17:07.840" style="s2">been physical challenges in a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.639" end="02:17:10.800" style="s2">ways or strict</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.840" end="02:17:12.080" style="s2">you know difficult mental challenges as</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.800" end="02:17:13.519" style="s2">far as</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.080" end="02:17:15.599" style="s2">trying to be a green beret or whatever</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.519" end="02:17:18.080" style="s2">it is um</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.599" end="02:17:18.880" style="s2">but when i find myself getting</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.080" end="02:17:21.840" style="s2">comfortable</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.880" end="02:17:22.800" style="s2">that&#39;s when i get complacent and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.840" end="02:17:25.280" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.800" end="02:17:26.880" style="s2">i start to to buy into things that maybe</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.280" end="02:17:30.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.880" end="02:17:32.080" style="s2">and i start to sort of drift you know to</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.000" end="02:17:35.120" style="s2">one way or another on a certain topic</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.080" end="02:17:37.040" style="s2">and start to form an opinion about a</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.120" end="02:17:40.080" style="s2">group of people</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.040" end="02:17:41.120" style="s2">instead of uh forming opinion around you</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.080" end="02:17:42.479" style="s2">know these are individuals with</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.120" end="02:17:44.719" style="s2">different ideas</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.479" end="02:17:45.679" style="s2">and just because this person wears that</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.719" end="02:17:48.160" style="s2">uniform and</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.679" end="02:17:48.719" style="s2">chooses this way of life or or raises</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.160" end="02:17:51.519" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.719" end="02:17:52.880" style="s2">flag or has that sign in their yard it</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.519" end="02:17:54.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.880" end="02:17:56.479" style="s2">um that i d that i maybe disagree with</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.960" end="02:17:58.960" style="s2">or agree with</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.479" end="02:18:00.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that that everything</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.960" end="02:18:03.280" style="s2">about that person is</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.240" end="02:18:05.519" style="s2">is not valuable you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.280" end="02:18:06.639" style="s2">something i should just completely uh</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.519" end="02:18:08.240" style="s2">write off because i</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.639" end="02:18:12.000" style="s2">have a tendency to do that i think a lot</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.240" end="02:18:16.399" style="s2">of us we do it&#39;s human nature we want to</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.000" end="02:18:19.679" style="s2">we want to to categorize everything</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.399" end="02:18:22.319" style="s2">and uh yeah i just i&#39;m a copycat i</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.679" end="02:18:24.000" style="s2">do my best to follow people that inspire</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.319" end="02:18:25.439" style="s2">me you gentlemen are two of those people</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.000" end="02:18:27.200" style="s2">i mean the way that you speak the way</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.439" end="02:18:29.840" style="s2">that you think about things</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.200" end="02:18:32.399" style="s2">how articulate you are it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.840" end="02:18:34.960" style="s2">that i&#39;m not necessarily great at so</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.399" end="02:18:35.679" style="s2">i try to listen and then i try to speak</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.960" end="02:18:37.599" style="s2">from the heart</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.679" end="02:18:38.800" style="s2">and just be as genuine as possible i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.599" end="02:18:40.479" style="s2">not good at</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.800" end="02:18:42.160" style="s2">anything scripted i&#39;m not good at</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.479" end="02:18:42.719" style="s2">memorization when it comes to that i</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.160" end="02:18:44.559" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.719" end="02:18:45.840" style="s2">i want to speak how i feel and that</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.559" end="02:18:49.120" style="s2">makes me feel better</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.840" end="02:18:51.439" style="s2">and hopefully it you know it</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.120" end="02:18:53.439" style="s2">resonates with some people you</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.439" end="02:18:56.800" style="s2">underestimate yourself mr boyer</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.439" end="02:18:59.120" style="s2">and uh yeah i&#39;m very uh very moved and</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.800" end="02:19:01.359" style="s2">persuaded by the way you explain the</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.120" end="02:19:02.160" style="s2">vital importance of humility which is</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.359" end="02:19:04.000" style="s2">why i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.160" end="02:19:06.240" style="s2">proud that i&#39;m always the most humble</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.000" end="02:19:08.399" style="s2">person in any room i walk into</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.240" end="02:19:10.240" style="s2">that&#39;s great i just you know i have no</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.399" end="02:19:14.160" style="s2">one is more humble than me though</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.240" end="02:19:14.160" style="s2">well i mean i beg the difference sir</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.319" end="02:19:17.519" style="s2">but ironically it&#39;s key to leadership</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.559" end="02:19:18.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t it well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:19:17.519" end="02:19:20.639" style="s2">sure there&#39;s some evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.800" end="02:19:21.200" style="s2">biological explanation for why that</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.639" end="02:19:22.559" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.200" end="02:19:24.160" style="s2">no i want to unpack it a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.559" end="02:19:26.000" style="s2">because i think that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.160" end="02:19:27.200" style="s2">very deep here but i often hear it</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.000" end="02:19:29.760" style="s2">misportrayed</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.200" end="02:19:30.479" style="s2">right like there&#39;s you know it&#39;s like do</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.760" end="02:19:34.160" style="s2">you sound</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.479" end="02:19:38.800" style="s2">humble i i don&#39;t care what i really</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.160" end="02:19:42.399" style="s2">want are leaders that um</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.800" end="02:19:44.080" style="s2">are not ego driven i want somebody who</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.399" end="02:19:45.280" style="s2">knows what they&#39;re capable of and has</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.080" end="02:19:48.240" style="s2">nothing to prove</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.280" end="02:19:49.600" style="s2">and actually the flip side of this an</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.240" end="02:19:53.200" style="s2">insecure leader</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.600" end="02:19:56.080" style="s2">i find very dangerous and i see this in</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.200" end="02:19:57.680" style="s2">trump and i saw it in bill clinton</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.080" end="02:20:01.040" style="s2">there&#39;s just something about the</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.680" end="02:20:03.200" style="s2">need to prove something that causes them</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.040" end="02:20:05.680" style="s2">to be willing to do terrible harm</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.200" end="02:20:06.720" style="s2">in order to deal with some demon in</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.680" end="02:20:08.240" style="s2">their past</p>

<p begin="02:25:28.240" end="02:25:33.600" style="s2">empathy right and i&#39;m heartened by the</p>

<p begin="02:25:33.600" end="02:25:36.240" style="s2">arguments that have tried to make the</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.960" end="02:25:39.040" style="s2">case that empathy</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.240" end="02:25:39.760" style="s2">is in fact a dangerous thing because it</p>

<p begin="02:25:39.760" end="02:25:44.319" style="s2">empathy itself that leads to those</p>

<p begin="02:25:47.920" end="02:25:52.080" style="s2">so much with the in-group they go to war</p>

<p begin="02:25:52.080" end="02:25:57.200" style="s2">which to me almost seems like a bit of</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.680" end="02:25:59.040" style="s2">sleight of hand is an argument because</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.200" end="02:26:01.120" style="s2">even within the statement there is the</p>

<p begin="02:26:02.399" end="02:26:05.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think is</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.439" end="02:26:07.520" style="s2">too much empathy on the in group it is</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.680" end="02:26:08.319" style="s2">it is the lack of empathy with the out</p>

<p begin="02:26:08.319" end="02:26:12.800" style="s2">but i have also heard and maybe this is</p>

<p begin="02:26:17.120" end="02:26:20.960" style="s2">empathy with the out group can</p>

<p begin="02:26:20.960" end="02:26:25.439" style="s2">conflict if we have a sort of empathy</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.200" end="02:26:26.160" style="s2">where we get so wrapped up in say the</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.439" end="02:26:29.200" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.160" end="02:26:32.560" style="s2">of just for example uh you know</p>

<p begin="02:26:42.160" end="02:26:45.120" style="s2">then we save in a certain context</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.920" end="02:26:47.280" style="s2">because we&#39;re so concerned with the</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.120" end="02:26:49.520" style="s2">suffering of a small group of people</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.280" end="02:26:51.439" style="s2">that we&#39;re willing to you know break the</p>

<p begin="02:26:53.920" end="02:26:58.080" style="s2">you deal with those uh</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.280" end="02:26:58.560" style="s2">those objections well uh it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.080" end="02:27:01.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.560" end="02:27:02.080" style="s2">and there is actually now well</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.040" end="02:27:04.000" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.080" end="02:27:06.080" style="s2">i would recommend people read robert</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.000" end="02:27:09.040" style="s2">sapolsky&#39;s book behave</p>
<p begin="02:27:06.080" end="02:27:10.319" style="s2">where he he covers this in depth and you</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.040" end="02:27:11.600" style="s2">know it used to be that we thought that</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.319" end="02:27:14.560" style="s2">oxytocin</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.600" end="02:27:16.479" style="s2">the hormone was the love hormone that it</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.560" end="02:27:18.479" style="s2">was the bonding hormone which it is</p>
<p begin="02:27:16.479" end="02:27:20.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just the bonding hormone</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.479" end="02:27:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the in-group out-group hormone</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.720" end="02:27:24.479" style="s2">and so the this molecule that is</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.760" end="02:27:27.280" style="s2">released</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.479" end="02:27:28.080" style="s2">when a mother bonds with her baby is</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.280" end="02:27:31.040" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.080" end="02:27:32.319" style="s2">involved in the recognizing something as</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.040" end="02:27:34.399" style="s2">the enemy</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.319" end="02:27:37.359" style="s2">so is that also the molecule i get when</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.399" end="02:27:38.880" style="s2">i bite into this chocolate cupcake</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.359" end="02:27:40.399" style="s2">nope that&#39;s good that&#39;s liable to be at</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.880" end="02:27:45.040" style="s2">least a certain amount of dopamine</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.399" end="02:27:48.720" style="s2">but uh anyway enjoy somebody yeah but</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.040" end="02:27:51.840" style="s2">anyway what i would say is we are</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.720" end="02:27:54.000" style="s2">very plastic creatures we can</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.840" end="02:27:55.600" style="s2">regard a very tiny number as in group</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.000" end="02:27:58.960" style="s2">and everybody else is out group</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.600" end="02:28:00.720" style="s2">or we can increasingly in group people</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.960" end="02:28:02.160" style="s2">who are more and more distant from us so</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.720" end="02:28:03.760" style="s2">this is sort of</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.160" end="02:28:05.600" style="s2">you know i see this encapsulated in</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.760" end="02:28:09.520" style="s2">christianity in</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.600" end="02:28:12.640" style="s2">you know the two stories um</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.520" end="02:28:14.399" style="s2">uh you know jesus tale of the the good</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.640" end="02:28:16.080" style="s2">samaritan</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.399" end="02:28:18.560" style="s2">is one and and the invocation of the</p>

<p begin="02:28:18.560" end="02:28:22.399" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.040" end="02:28:24.640" style="s2">the the in-group expands right</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.399" end="02:28:26.080" style="s2">um now ultimately the question is can</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.640" end="02:28:29.200" style="s2">the in-group be expanded</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.080" end="02:28:30.960" style="s2">all the way and should it be and</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.200" end="02:28:33.040" style="s2">you know this is not an immediate</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.960" end="02:28:34.560" style="s2">suggestion but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.040" end="02:28:38.160" style="s2">the peril that we all</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.560" end="02:28:40.800" style="s2">share as you know creatures</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.160" end="02:28:42.160" style="s2">fighting against incredible odds over</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.800" end="02:28:44.560" style="s2">the long term</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.160" end="02:28:45.680" style="s2">um trapped on a planet together that we</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.560" end="02:28:48.319" style="s2">are now</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.680" end="02:28:49.680" style="s2">uh spending into oblivion behaving very</p>

<p begin="02:28:49.680" end="02:28:52.720" style="s2">if we recognize the jeopardy that we are</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.000" end="02:28:55.920" style="s2">putting</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.720" end="02:28:57.760" style="s2">all of our all of us in by fighting</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.920" end="02:28:59.439" style="s2">between us rather than recognizing that</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.760" end="02:29:03.120" style="s2">at some level</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.439" end="02:29:04.640" style="s2">it must be true that sustainability will</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.120" end="02:29:07.120" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.640" end="02:29:08.000" style="s2">be the mode that we discover or we will</p>

<p begin="02:29:11.600" end="02:29:16.960" style="s2">in us in grouping humanity</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.800" end="02:29:20.479" style="s2">now this is a discussion from another</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.960" end="02:29:23.280" style="s2">time you have to do it very carefully</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.479" end="02:29:24.880" style="s2">or it will be self-unstable but</p>
<p begin="02:29:23.280" end="02:29:26.240" style="s2">ultimately i do think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.880" end="02:29:28.720" style="s2">what we should be heading for is a</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.240" end="02:29:31.520" style="s2">recognition that um</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.720" end="02:29:33.680" style="s2">what we have is the result of having</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.520" end="02:29:36.240" style="s2">recognized a larger and larger</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.680" end="02:29:37.520" style="s2">set of people as within our in group and</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.240" end="02:29:40.240" style="s2">that ultimately</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.520" end="02:29:41.680" style="s2">the best and probably only stable end</p>
<p begin="02:29:40.240" end="02:29:44.160" style="s2">point is to recognize</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.680" end="02:29:46.160" style="s2">we are all in group and that our</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.160" end="02:29:48.319" style="s2">long-term well-being depends</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.160" end="02:29:49.439" style="s2">on us standing down the competitive</p>

<p begin="02:29:57.200" end="02:30:00.560" style="s2">can i add a data point that supports</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.280" end="02:30:02.960" style="s2">that which is we just</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.560" end="02:30:04.399" style="s2">asked other than announced candidates</p>

<p begin="02:30:07.840" end="02:30:12.000" style="s2">uh 70 percent 77 percent of people the</p>

<p begin="02:30:12.000" end="02:30:17.200" style="s2">second most popular answer uh was i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:30:22.800" end="02:30:26.319" style="s2">because i&#39;m nervous</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.560" end="02:30:31.280" style="s2">so this actually</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.760" end="02:30:33.280" style="s2">suggests a line of questioning i was</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.280" end="02:30:35.600" style="s2">hoping we would get to</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.280" end="02:30:36.560" style="s2">which is i have the sense that those of</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.600" end="02:30:38.640" style="s2">us in the unity</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.560" end="02:30:39.680" style="s2">conversation recognize that none of the</p>

<p begin="02:30:39.680" end="02:30:43.760" style="s2">neither one blue or red is the least bit</p>

<p begin="02:30:43.760" end="02:30:48.080" style="s2">and the disaster may be very different</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.080" end="02:30:49.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s still a disaster coming either</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.080" end="02:30:51.680" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.520" end="02:30:53.520" style="s2">but most of the people we engage with</p>

<p begin="02:30:53.520" end="02:31:00.720" style="s2">yet are able to see one of the disasters</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.000" end="02:31:02.399" style="s2">and incapable of seeing the other and</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.720" end="02:31:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason that they&#39;re so hard</p>

<p begin="02:31:02.960" end="02:31:06.080" style="s2">and so the question i want to ask first</p>
<p begin="02:31:05.760" end="02:31:08.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.080" end="02:31:10.560" style="s2">of john and nate and then of the</p>

<p begin="02:31:14.399" end="02:31:18.880" style="s2">blue no matter who voters</p>
<p begin="02:31:16.399" end="02:31:20.479" style="s2">right where you see trump as the problem</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.880" end="02:31:21.359" style="s2">and your sense is well until that</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.479" end="02:31:23.760" style="s2">problem&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.359" end="02:31:24.960" style="s2">i&#39;m voting blue and i don&#39;t care about</p>

<p begin="02:31:28.080" end="02:31:32.800" style="s2">see the danger of that solution</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.280" end="02:31:34.479" style="s2">if they see the trump danger and they</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.800" end="02:31:35.600" style="s2">can&#39;t see the biden danger what will</p>

<p begin="02:31:35.600" end="02:31:39.600" style="s2">and then the flip side is if you see the</p>
<p begin="02:31:38.640" end="02:31:44.000" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.600" end="02:31:46.240" style="s2">of the biden answer here and you think</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.000" end="02:31:47.280" style="s2">you know maybe you&#39;re one of these</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.240" end="02:31:48.800" style="s2">voters who</p>
<p begin="02:31:47.280" end="02:31:51.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t in love with the trump solution</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.800" end="02:31:52.000" style="s2">but you recognize it as at least a break</p>
<p begin="02:31:51.120" end="02:31:54.720" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="02:31:52.000" end="02:31:57.040" style="s2">uh the standard pattern what can be said</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.720" end="02:31:58.399" style="s2">to those voters so that they can see the</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.040" end="02:32:02.560" style="s2">hazard of continuing</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.399" end="02:32:05.520" style="s2">another four years down this road</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.560" end="02:32:07.040" style="s2">so let me let me engage that and and</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.520" end="02:32:10.640" style="s2">actually brett i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:32:07.040" end="02:32:11.920" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m at the maximum of my my time uh</p>

<p begin="02:32:11.920" end="02:32:17.040" style="s2">probably have to step away after this</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.240" end="02:32:18.160" style="s2">um but this has been terrific and and</p>
<p begin="02:32:17.040" end="02:32:21.200" style="s2">let me let me engage</p>
<p begin="02:32:18.160" end="02:32:24.000" style="s2">that in the context of uh</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.200" end="02:32:24.640" style="s2">trump voters here but the principle will</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.000" end="02:32:28.000" style="s2">clearly be</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.640" end="02:32:30.720" style="s2">applicable across the board i think um</p>
<p begin="02:32:28.000" end="02:32:31.120" style="s2">a lot of folks and i say this you know</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.720" end="02:32:33.439" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.120" end="02:32:35.040" style="s2">absolutely no judgment or condemnation</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.439" end="02:32:38.240" style="s2">of folks voting for trump or</p>
<p begin="02:32:35.040" end="02:32:41.520" style="s2">biden uh or anybody else um</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.240" end="02:32:44.720" style="s2">but a lot of folks felt that they had to</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.520" end="02:32:48.080" style="s2">kind of sidestep their</p>
<p begin="02:32:44.720" end="02:32:50.880" style="s2">normal sort of uh conscience or</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.080" end="02:32:52.399" style="s2">barometer for evaluating the behavior of</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.880" end="02:32:53.840" style="s2">a candidate who they could wholly feel</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.399" end="02:32:55.920" style="s2">good about supporting because the threat</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.840" end="02:32:57.920" style="s2">from the left was so imminent that they</p>
<p begin="02:32:55.920" end="02:32:59.439" style="s2">felt like they had to back a person who</p>
<p begin="02:32:57.920" end="02:33:01.520" style="s2">was going to be a useful bludgeon</p>
<p begin="02:32:59.439" end="02:33:04.640" style="s2">against destructive forces in society</p>
<p begin="02:33:01.520" end="02:33:07.120" style="s2">and he was standing up for policies</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.640" end="02:33:08.319" style="s2">that mattered to them right and so for a</p>
<p begin="02:33:07.120" end="02:33:09.840" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.319" end="02:33:11.680" style="s2">the economy was good we have</p>

<p begin="02:33:11.680" end="02:33:15.120" style="s2">so forth from that</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.960" end="02:33:16.800" style="s2">from that angle trump presidency was</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.120" end="02:33:19.040" style="s2">arguably successful up until</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.800" end="02:33:20.319" style="s2">other things happened right but the</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.040" end="02:33:22.479" style="s2">thing that i always</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.319" end="02:33:23.439" style="s2">argued in all directions is that</p>

<p begin="02:33:55.120" end="02:33:58.319" style="s2">is that we&#39;re all seeking to sabotage</p>

<p begin="02:35:44.080" end="02:35:48.640" style="s2">well before unity 2020 because even</p>

<p begin="02:35:48.640" end="02:35:51.920" style="s2">it is again a question of what sort of</p>

<p begin="02:38:24.640" end="02:38:28.080" style="s2">that hopelessness and i mean that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.640" end="02:38:30.399" style="s2">of the main reasons i wanted to ask that</p>
<p begin="02:38:28.080" end="02:38:32.000" style="s2">question about about hopefulness because</p>
<p begin="02:38:30.399" end="02:38:35.200" style="s2">i actually feel</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.000" end="02:38:38.319" style="s2">that hopefulness um i i just</p>
<p begin="02:38:35.200" end="02:38:39.359" style="s2">don&#39;t feel it in the masses</p>
<p begin="02:38:38.319" end="02:38:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not that i don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.359" end="02:38:42.319" style="s2">capable i just don&#39;t think they</p>

<p begin="02:38:42.319" end="02:38:47.760" style="s2">that or believe in any way that it is</p>
<p begin="02:38:45.200" end="02:38:49.840" style="s2">possible and i know it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="02:38:47.760" end="02:38:51.680" style="s2">because i&#39;ve seen people change i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:38:49.840" end="02:38:54.399" style="s2">seen things radically</p>
<p begin="02:38:51.680" end="02:38:56.560" style="s2">shift in a short period of time um you</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.399" end="02:38:57.120" style="s2">know not maybe at a national level like</p>
<p begin="02:38:56.560" end="02:38:58.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="02:38:57.120" end="02:39:00.560" style="s2">just a few couple of months before the</p>
<p begin="02:38:58.960" end="02:39:04.640" style="s2">an election</p>
<p begin="02:39:00.560" end="02:39:08.240" style="s2">but uh when people get to a point where</p>
<p begin="02:39:04.640" end="02:39:09.200" style="s2">they finally see and believe how broken</p>
<p begin="02:39:08.240" end="02:39:11.920" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.200" end="02:39:13.760" style="s2">and how painful it is to live to live in</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.920" end="02:39:16.560" style="s2">this place right now</p>
<p begin="02:39:13.760" end="02:39:17.359" style="s2">uh and how frustrating it is you know i</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.560" end="02:39:18.960" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="02:39:17.359" end="02:39:20.960" style="s2">their eyes may be open they may be</p>
<p begin="02:39:18.960" end="02:39:23.840" style="s2">willing to listen to</p>
<p begin="02:39:20.960" end="02:39:26.000" style="s2">to something that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="02:39:23.840" end="02:39:28.160" style="s2">opposite of what they&#39;re accustomed to</p>
<p begin="02:39:26.000" end="02:39:29.600" style="s2">and uh i just i think it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="02:39:28.160" end="02:39:31.920" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely necessary we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="02:39:29.600" end="02:39:34.080" style="s2">rip the band-aids off and start over</p>
<p begin="02:39:31.920" end="02:39:35.040" style="s2">um but it&#39;s just it&#39;s going to take a</p>
<p begin="02:39:34.080" end="02:39:38.160" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.040" end="02:39:40.880" style="s2">on board to do it beautiful amen</p>
<p begin="02:39:38.160" end="02:39:42.560" style="s2">um there is a hopi saying or at least</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.880" end="02:39:44.240" style="s2">frequently attributed to hopi elders</p>
<p begin="02:39:42.560" end="02:39:45.920" style="s2">which i really like which is we are the</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.240" end="02:39:49.280" style="s2">ones we&#39;ve been waiting for</p>
<p begin="02:39:45.920" end="02:39:51.439" style="s2">and i think at some level that uh nicely</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.280" end="02:39:52.960" style="s2">bridges the two final statements you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.439" end="02:39:55.760" style="s2">just given and</p>
<p begin="02:39:52.960" end="02:39:58.080" style="s2">i hope we do it um thank you both for</p>

<p begin="02:40:02.720" end="02:40:05.439" style="s2">reasons one of them had to do with the</p>
<p begin="02:40:04.399" end="02:40:07.600" style="s2">ability to take</p>
<p begin="02:40:05.439" end="02:40:09.040" style="s2">embers from a fire and start another one</p>
<p begin="02:40:07.600" end="02:40:10.319" style="s2">and i would encourage people</p>

<p begin="02:40:12.160" end="02:40:15.439" style="s2">difficult conversation</p>
<p begin="02:40:13.840" end="02:40:17.200" style="s2">with somebody you don&#39;t fully agree with</p>
<p begin="02:40:15.439" end="02:40:19.439" style="s2">somewhere and</p>
