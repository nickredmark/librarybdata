<p begin="00:00:03.529" end="00:00:09.000" style="s2">Jordan Peterson has become hugely</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.270" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">successful what do you make of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:15.529" style="s2">phenomena why do you think he&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">so successful now there is a drought of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.529" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">authenticity and courage and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">has found that hunger and he&#39;s tapped</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">into it and I I admire his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:37.739" style="s2">detect it and to speak to it plainly in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">a way that it resonates with I did we</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.739" end="00:00:47.010" style="s2">were on a panel together in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">and I watched his talk and he described</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.010" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">his own surprise at how effective his</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">message had been and he basically said</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">that if he had outlined his message as</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">the core of a business model that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:03.449" style="s2">would have looked laughable to him and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.640" style="s2">that he was as shocked as anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.449" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">people are resonating with it but when</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.640" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">when you live in a world that is as full</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">of crap as the world we live in where</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">people are advertising bullshit to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">from the moment you get up to the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">you go to sleep and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">finally tells you some truth that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">need to hear it&#39;s a relief it&#39;s a relief</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:30.409" style="s2">just to know that there&#39;s some channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">that isn&#39;t compromised by nonsense and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.409" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">he I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">speaking truthfully but I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">speaking from the heart</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">and people know it he doesn&#39;t someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">who from his lectures takes evolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">seriously how does that overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:54.530" style="s2">your work and how does it map onto your</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">work well I would say Peterson is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.530" end="00:01:59.369" style="s2">exceptional psychologist in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:02.280" style="s2">that at the moment academic psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.369" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">is in a crisis where all of the results</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">that people have treated is true because</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">they had a statistical significance are</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">turning out to be difficult to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:14.200" style="s2">and therefore probably fiction</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">Peterson is not swept into that madness</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.200" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">because he&#39;s chosen to stay in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:23.800" style="s2">quadrant in psychology where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:26.050" style="s2">solid ground so he is I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.800" end="00:02:28.390" style="s2">say totally unique but somewhat unique</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.050" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">in that landscape as can you explain</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.390" end="00:02:31.090" style="s2">what that means that he&#39;s chosen to stay</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:33.850" style="s2">installed at Graham woods this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.090" end="00:02:36.760" style="s2">psychometrics you mean yes Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.850" end="00:02:41.050" style="s2">stuck with psychometrics where results</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:45.340" style="s2">are replicated and the the model is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.050" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">sound and so anyway he&#39;s less affected</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.340" end="00:02:51.070" style="s2">maybe unaffected by the replication</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:54.190" style="s2">crisis he is a psychologist takes</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.070" end="00:02:56.830" style="s2">evolution seriously as all psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.190" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">should he can&#39;t be a specialist in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.830" end="00:03:01.630" style="s2">evolutionary biology so he&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">danger of dabbling and not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.630" end="00:03:05.650" style="s2">full richness of some of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:07.450" style="s2">he&#39;s interested in but nonetheless it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.650" end="00:03:10.150" style="s2">to his credit that he takes it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.450" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">where most of psychology dispenses with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.150" end="00:03:16.269" style="s2">evolution entirely I&#39;m an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.010" style="s2">biologist you take psychology seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.269" end="00:03:20.920" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.010" end="00:03:23.110" style="s2">and so a lot of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.920" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">interested in play out in Psychological</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.110" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">terms I&#39;m not a specialist in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:30.070" style="s2">but I have to grapple with it in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:32.019" style="s2">to to understand the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.070" end="00:03:35.110" style="s2">interested in and so in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.019" end="00:03:37.269" style="s2">there&#39;s a comparison we are either side</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.110" end="00:03:39.190" style="s2">of a divide about which our home ground</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.269" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">is and which other discipline we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.190" end="00:03:46.330" style="s2">engaged with because his his map is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">really based on Jungian psychology the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.330" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">idea of the shadow the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">integration of the shadow the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:55.570" style="s2">the reality of myth and the usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:57.820" style="s2">of myth and religion is that something</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.570" end="00:04:01.930" style="s2">that maps onto your evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.820" end="00:04:04.540" style="s2">territory so I&#39;ve been playing with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.930" end="00:04:09.940" style="s2">idea of myth for a long time and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.540" end="00:04:13.150" style="s2">conclusion has been that things that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:16.510" style="s2">costly to us but that last must be</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.150" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">paying their way in some evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.510" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">positive fashion so myth clearly passes</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">this test</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">and when I heard Peterson talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:29.070" style="s2">it my thought was that we were aligned</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:31.350" style="s2">as I listened more to him I realized</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.070" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">that there is an alignment to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.350" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">we both believe that those stories that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">have persisted over time have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">value but then there&#39;s also a disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:43.710" style="s2">where he imagines that these stories are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">inherently timeless and I&#39;m aware of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.710" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">many things that are long-lasting are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.890" style="s2">now not functional in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:52.290" style="s2">circumstances because of the level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.890" end="00:04:53.669" style="s2">evolutionary novelty so I hope to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.290" end="00:04:56.520" style="s2">that conversation with him at some point</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.669" end="00:04:58.140" style="s2">so in the Jungian psychology he talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.520" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">about the shadow he talks about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.140" end="00:05:02.190" style="s2">the Jungian idea the roots of the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">reach all the way down to hell like</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.190" end="00:05:11.730" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of I guess desire to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:14.660" style="s2">dominate like does that map on to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.730" end="00:05:18.169" style="s2">your model in some way I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.660" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">Jungian psychology is a useful myth and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.169" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">I you know I I don&#39;t mean that to sound</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:27.090" style="s2">forger ative I think it&#39;s not true in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:29.640" style="s2">narrow literal sense but many unions</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.090" end="00:05:33.169" style="s2">have made progress because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.640" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">something to it what I see is that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.169" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">are a very odd species we like every</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:44.250" style="s2">species have a mission that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">uninteresting that mission is to pass on</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.250" end="00:05:49.140" style="s2">our genetic Spelling&#39;s to the exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:53.510" style="s2">of alternative genetic Spelling&#39;s to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.140" end="00:05:57.240" style="s2">extent possible we also have the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">amazing toolkit in nature for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.240" end="00:06:01.350" style="s2">a toolkit that is capable of having</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:02.970" style="s2">conscious thoughts and whatsmore</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.350" end="00:06:05.190" style="s2">exchanging those conscious thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.970" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">between individuals we can set our</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.190" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">values we can say what would we like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">accomplish and what we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:15.479" style="s2">accomplish is capable of being something</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">other than gene spreading so my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.479" end="00:06:21.770" style="s2">is once you recognize how dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:25.140" style="s2">mind-numbing our evolutionary purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.770" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">you can&#39;t help but rebel against it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.140" end="00:06:31.470" style="s2">if you rebel against it then you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">this marvelous machine that you can set</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.470" end="00:06:34.230" style="s2">to a more interesting more noble more</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.230" end="00:06:39.270" style="s2">full purpose and why wouldn&#39;t you who</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.330" end="00:06:41.700" style="s2">wants to be an agent for a mindless</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.270" end="00:06:43.170" style="s2">program for spreading particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.700" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">spellings to the exclusion of others</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.170" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not an interesting game at all so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">my sense is we face one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">puzzles that has ever been maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">the greatest puzzle that has ever been</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:07:01.890" style="s2">which is can we re author or purpose now</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:04.830" style="s2">that we know how generic and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.890" end="00:07:06.540" style="s2">our evolutionary purpose is can we take</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.830" end="00:07:08.850" style="s2">the machinery that was built for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.540" end="00:07:10.650" style="s2">purpose the marvelous machinery set to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.850" end="00:07:13.950" style="s2">that terrible purpose can we repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.650" end="00:07:16.350" style="s2">it to something worthy of us it seems a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.950" end="00:07:17.820" style="s2">lot of the reactivity of the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.350" end="00:07:19.800" style="s2">media and it was certainly the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.820" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">the Kathy Newman interview was around</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">gender and why do you think that is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:30.510" style="s2">why as a evolutionary biologist someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:33.480" style="s2">who sort of studies studies sex and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.510" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">gender in detail why why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.480" end="00:07:39.540" style="s2">that this has become the the crux of so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:42.920" style="s2">many of these conversations well I I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.540" end="00:07:44.850" style="s2">it as a like a slow-motion train wreck</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.920" end="00:07:49.070" style="s2">completely unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.850" end="00:07:52.170" style="s2">but can&#39;t be stopped because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:55.770" style="s2">has a sense that they have a dog in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.170" end="00:07:58.410" style="s2">fight and we all do but people do not</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.770" end="00:08:01.530" style="s2">understand where their interests lie in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.410" end="00:08:04.350" style="s2">this discussion and so they are lashing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.530" end="00:08:06.150" style="s2">out for lack of a better term in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.350" end="00:08:08.250" style="s2">attempt to shut down that which they</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.150" end="00:08:09.450" style="s2">think threatens them but their map of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.250" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">what is threatening to them and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.450" end="00:08:13.920" style="s2">actually serves their interests is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:16.140" style="s2">almost random compared to the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.920" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">breeding systems and what people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.140" end="00:08:22.470" style="s2">actually want and the irony is inside of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">evolutionary biology this is all pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.470" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">well understood it&#39;s not like that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">getting male-female sexual dynamics what</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">they mean and what different social</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2">systems are about so this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">there&#39;s no debate inside of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:44.769" style="s2">biology about whether males and females</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:46.179" style="s2">are basically the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.769" end="00:08:47.679" style="s2">we all know that males and females are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.179" end="00:08:49.449" style="s2">not basically the same there are many</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.679" end="00:08:50.619" style="s2">things about us that are the same but</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.449" end="00:08:53.199" style="s2">there are so many things that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.619" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">different and those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.199" end="00:09:00.040" style="s2">different may be inherited genetically</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:02.170" style="s2">they may be inherited culturally but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.040" end="00:09:05.410" style="s2">they all have meanings it&#39;s not an open</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.170" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">landscape in which you can just design</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.410" end="00:09:12.519" style="s2">whatever you want so what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:14.709" style="s2">wishful thinking everywhere and people</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.519" end="00:09:16.239" style="s2">imagining they are much more informed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.709" end="00:09:19.779" style="s2">about sexual dynamics than they actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.239" end="00:09:22.029" style="s2">are I guess what a lot of people fear</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.779" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">when they hear evolutionary biologists</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.029" end="00:09:27.069" style="s2">talk about sex roles is that where</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:30.129" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to sort of reimpose roles</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.069" end="00:09:35.759" style="s2">that were cast off in the 1960&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.129" end="00:09:38.860" style="s2">1970&#39;s so this this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.759" end="00:09:42.660" style="s2">misunderstanding the roles that we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.860" end="00:09:46.509" style="s2">recently abandoned are almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.660" end="00:09:48.970" style="s2">unbelievably ancient my favorite example</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.509" end="00:09:51.610" style="s2">involves looking at a flower that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.970" end="00:09:55.089" style="s2">contains both male and female parts in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.610" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">the same structure a flower that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.089" end="00:09:59.709" style="s2">both male and female parts has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.790" end="00:10:02.619" style="s2">difference of opinion within itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.709" end="00:10:04.600" style="s2">about how enthusiastic to be about sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.619" end="00:10:06.730" style="s2">with strangers the male parts are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.600" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">gung-ho for it the female parts not so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">much female parts in fact at a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:15.879" style="s2">structural level are coy they put the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">pollen grains through a test in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.879" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2">pollen tubes grow down through a long</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:24.429" style="s2">structure in order to reach the OVA so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:27.879" style="s2">we can decide that we either do want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.429" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">retain female coyness in some form or</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.879" end="00:10:32.619" style="s2">that we want to reject it but what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:36.429" style="s2">can&#39;t do is decide that that was imposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.619" end="00:10:39.790" style="s2">by some sort of Puritan viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.429" end="00:10:42.790" style="s2">amongst males and you know in recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.790" end="00:10:44.919" style="s2">times it&#39;s not it it stretches back far</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.790" end="00:10:46.899" style="s2">enough into the past that we can find it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.919" end="00:10:48.759" style="s2">across the animal kingdom and if we look</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.899" end="00:10:51.009" style="s2">into plants that separately evolved but</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.759" end="00:10:57.220" style="s2">nonetheless the same pattern emerges</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.009" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">there so we should alter the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.220" end="00:11:00.670" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:03.310" style="s2">or modern times and we should do so with</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.670" end="00:11:07.149" style="s2">fairness in mind I&#39;m very much in favor</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.310" end="00:11:09.720" style="s2">of this I&#39;m married to a woman who used</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.149" end="00:11:13.899" style="s2">the world in masculine terms I mean she</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.720" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">lives in a way that makes sense in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.899" end="00:11:18.250" style="s2">masculine terms she goes to the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:21.430" style="s2">she you know enjoys adventure of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.250" end="00:11:23.320" style="s2">certain kind I&#39;m all in favor of women</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.430" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">doing things that are not traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.320" end="00:11:28.779" style="s2">female but are not in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:31.660" style="s2">pretending that femininity was invented</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.779" end="00:11:33.310" style="s2">by men to keep women chaste or something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.660" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">like that it wasn&#39;t invented by humans</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.310" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">because this I guess is another part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">the discussion because from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:43.149" style="s2">postmodern viewpoint even using the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">words masculine and feminine but they</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.149" end="00:11:47.050" style="s2">assume that those are culturally defined</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:48.130" style="s2">and then you get into a question well</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:50.350" style="s2">what do you mean by masculine what do</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.130" end="00:11:52.440" style="s2">you mean by feminine and you you then</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.350" end="00:11:54.430" style="s2">sort of enter a language game and a loop</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.440" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">where they sort of don&#39;t refer to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.430" end="00:11:57.399" style="s2">anything but what you&#39;re saying is they</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:00.130" style="s2">actually do refer to things you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.399" end="00:12:02.529" style="s2">study right down to to flowers and to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.130" end="00:12:05.740" style="s2">plants and to things that are not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.529" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">are not human there&#39;s a actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.740" end="00:12:11.800" style="s2">simple story that accompanies this truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:16.149" style="s2">which is there are very few creatures in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.800" end="00:12:18.310" style="s2">which gametes are the same size there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.149" end="00:12:19.959" style="s2">an unstable equilibrium in which gametes</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.310" end="00:12:22.630" style="s2">are equal size and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.959" end="00:12:25.149" style="s2">that gametes in any creature that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.630" end="00:12:27.430" style="s2">two sexes will tend to have one sex with</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.149" end="00:12:30.100" style="s2">small mobile gametes and another sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:31.930" style="s2">with large sessile Gamble&#39;s once you</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.100" end="00:12:34.709" style="s2">have that dynamic you have an asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.930" end="00:12:37.149" style="s2">in the interest of the parents in</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.709" end="00:12:39.970" style="s2">investing in those gametes small mobile</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.149" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">gametes are not worth investing heavily</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.970" end="00:12:44.680" style="s2">and and large society mutes are worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:46.510" style="s2">being choosy over because the investment</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.680" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">that they contain is greater now that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.510" end="00:12:52.019" style="s2">has almost nothing to do with us at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">direct level but every time we have had</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.019" end="00:12:58.149" style="s2">creatures evolved in which there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:13:00.420" style="s2">asymmetry of investment in offspring you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.149" end="00:13:03.579" style="s2">get other things evolving as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.420" end="00:13:05.980" style="s2">consequence like choose eNOS it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.579" end="00:13:08.350" style="s2">natural that a creature that has larger</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">gametes should be choosy it is natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.350" end="00:13:11.690" style="s2">that a creature that gets pregnant</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.340" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">a long childhood should be choosey now</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.270" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">in human beings we have a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:25.400" style="s2">interesting situation where men</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:27.080" style="s2">reproduced by two strategies men can</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.400" end="00:13:29.000" style="s2">love them and leave them in which case</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.080" end="00:13:30.680" style="s2">they&#39;re not very choosy because why</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.000" end="00:13:33.860" style="s2">should they be at an evolutionary level</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.680" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">and men more generally invest in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.860" end="00:13:37.580" style="s2">offspring in which case they have every</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">reason to be as choosy as women do so</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.580" end="00:13:41.960" style="s2">human beings are not some standard case</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.460" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">from nature they&#39;re a special case and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.960" end="00:13:48.770" style="s2">an interesting one but to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.920" end="00:13:52.550" style="s2">females being more reluctant about sex</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.770" end="00:13:54.710" style="s2">was the idea of men who wanted to impose</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.550" end="00:13:55.730" style="s2">something on women is preposterous it</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.710" end="00:13:57.740" style="s2">exists in birds</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.740" end="00:14:03.530" style="s2">and when you&#39;re talking about sort of</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.530" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">deep what I what I hear is sort of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:12.830" style="s2">some of the ancient wisdom traditions</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:58.029" style="s2">defending it as what ought we should be</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.449" end="00:17:01.660" style="s2">having the conversation about what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.029" end="00:17:03.910" style="s2">is do we want to retain what that is do</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.660" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">we want to jettison and how much freedom</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:08.890" style="s2">do we have to move things and we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:13.209" style="s2">much more freedom than than those who</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.890" end="00:17:14.650" style="s2">are pushing a naive symmetry would</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.209" end="00:17:17.230" style="s2">imagine we have a lot of freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.650" end="00:17:19.750" style="s2">refigure the dynamics of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.230" end="00:17:22.900" style="s2">and we should do it because this I guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.750" end="00:17:24.520" style="s2">is the is the concern that when people</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.900" end="00:17:25.929" style="s2">talk about evolutionary biology are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.520" end="00:17:27.069" style="s2">saying well this is our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.929" end="00:17:29.110" style="s2">toolkit many women have different</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.069" end="00:17:30.970" style="s2">evolutionary toolkits what people then</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.110" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">hear is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.970" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">a sense of this is unchangeable this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:39.789" style="s2">we&#39;re then in a binary between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">Conservatives view that we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.789" end="00:17:44.679" style="s2">basically we&#39;re going to have to go back</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:47.429" style="s2">to the 1950s and the liberal idea and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.679" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">how do we transcend that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.429" end="00:17:54.309" style="s2">the the culture war unfortunately there</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:56.980" style="s2">is a kind of failure of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.309" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">that extends into evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.980" end="00:18:03.809" style="s2">and also exists in a widespread form in</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">public which has to do with evolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.809" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">being synonymous with genes so when</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:14.409" style="s2">people talk they will say is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">biological or is it cultural well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.409" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">not a good dichotomy it happens that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:22.299" style="s2">culture is equally biological as genes</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">and once we understand that then we will</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.299" end="00:18:26.470" style="s2">realize that to say that some dynamic is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.120" style="s2">evolved and that&#39;s why it exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.470" end="00:18:29.980" style="s2">present does not mean it&#39;s inflexible</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.120" end="00:18:32.169" style="s2">because if it&#39;s evolved but it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.980" end="00:18:34.659" style="s2">transmitted culturally we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.169" end="00:18:36.750" style="s2">an opportunity to to alter that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.659" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">landscape so if we look at for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.750" end="00:18:42.580" style="s2">female fighter pilots there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">that females should not be fighter</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.580" end="00:18:47.169" style="s2">pilots if that&#39;s what they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:49.150" style="s2">but warfare has always been the province</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.169" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2">of men does it need to remain the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.150" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">province of men that&#39;s a discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.700" end="00:18:55.750" style="s2">can have but there&#39;s no technical reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:18:57.549" style="s2">and obviously the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.750" end="00:19:00.370" style="s2">female fighter pilots tells us that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.549" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">can retune that dynamic any way that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.370" end="00:19:06.039" style="s2">think is right and lots of things in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:08.440" style="s2">this in this area worked that way where</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.039" end="00:19:09.880" style="s2">they are evolved there&#39;s a history but</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.440" end="00:19:12.909" style="s2">it is transmitted in a way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.880" end="00:19:14.950" style="s2">amenable to being altered I&#39;ve often had</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.909" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">a sense that basically what&#39;s needed is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.950" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">for the liberal worldview to be read</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:23.500" style="s2">pilled in some degree that to accept</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:25.510" style="s2">biology but then understand that it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.500" end="00:19:27.159" style="s2">in some degree malleable rather than</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.510" end="00:19:28.630" style="s2">being in sort of this reactivity to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.159" end="00:19:32.159" style="s2">and this seems to be where we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.630" end="00:19:35.409" style="s2">stuck at the moment I agree with you and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.159" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve I&#39;ve known for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.409" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">as I studied evolution as a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:44.680" style="s2">that the left has an uneasy relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:47.140" style="s2">with evolution on the one hand it is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.680" end="00:19:49.000" style="s2">defender of Darwin against creationism</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.140" end="00:19:50.860" style="s2">traditionally on the other hand when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.000" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">gets to talking about evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.860" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">human beings the left is extremely timid</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:57.730" style="s2">about what it may find and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:20:00.450" style="s2">some sense it is afraid of a boogeyman</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.730" end="00:20:02.890" style="s2">that just simply doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.450" end="00:20:07.570" style="s2">evolutionary biologists as a rule tend</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.890" end="00:20:10.600" style="s2">to be quite left-wing Dawkins in The</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:22.030" style="s2">we must alter things in order that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:25.660" style="s2">does not dominate our our view of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.660" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">be to get people to listen long enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.140" end="00:20:32.560" style="s2">so that they understand that the</p>
