<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:03.899" style="s2">all right so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:05.970" style="s2">be able to pull this off</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.899" end="00:00:08.519" style="s2">but it feels like it&#39;s getting pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.970" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">close to timeline and maybe I can so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.519" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">let&#39;s give it a shot three basic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">the first idea has to do with something</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">like we should we should consider the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.039" end="00:00:27.269" style="s2">the order of magnitude of effort or</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">energy or degree of change that we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.269" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">bringing to an event that is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:35.579" style="s2">for there to be a real change so let me</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">give you a concrete example let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.579" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">have a very heavy sphere like a boulder</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:47.430" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe 100 or so pounds and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">a shallow pool some kind of common</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.430" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">concrete pool that&#39;s maybe six feet deep</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">and I want to get it out of the pool</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">right now if I if I push it for four</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">feet and then I let go it&#39;s gonna roll</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">back into the bottom of the pool if I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">apply 80 pounds of force it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:06.810" style="s2">to move at all all right so what I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">to do is I have to say I have to apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.810" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">more than a hundred pounds of force and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">more than over six feet there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">some specific physics that describe what</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">happens I&#39;m going up the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">friction and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">but unless I do at least that much then</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:24.600" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t get out of the pool right I</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">get up to the goo that some amount or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">not at all and it will roll back to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">where it came from so that&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">concept right the idea that if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">got some some amount of change that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">necessary to accomplish I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:43.189" style="s2">call it a real change then you can you</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">can be quite sure that if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.189" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">impart a an adequate amount and by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">way inadequate directionality if I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">my whatever six hundred foot pounds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">force and I sort of do it in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">around the basin around the pool</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:59.630" style="s2">it still doesn&#39;t get out right I have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:03.689" style="s2">have a directionality and a magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.630" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">I&#39;m wasting my time and okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.689" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">that&#39;s the first concept that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:11.690" style="s2">that hard let me say it a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:14.040" style="s2">different way to just make sure it lands</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.690" end="00:02:17.549" style="s2">so now what I have is I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.040" end="00:02:19.319" style="s2">a train the train is is on the tracks</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.549" end="00:02:21.299" style="s2">and is heading for something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.319" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">valuable like you know the classic scene</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.299" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">of the you know the child who&#39;s stuck on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">the track and I am a superhero and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:30.689" style="s2">tried to stop the train well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">that hard to sort of say if the Train</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.689" end="00:02:35.849" style="s2">has whatever one Giga ton of force</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">heading down the tracks if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.849" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">stop the train I have to apply at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:43.260" style="s2">minus 1 or 1 Giga ton of force go in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">other direction to stop the train if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">if I apply 500 megatons</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">I slowed the train down and it still</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">kills the kid all right so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:53.909" style="s2">it that kind of a notion is simple right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:57.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a simple idea and yet often times I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.909" end="00:02:58.859" style="s2">think we find ourselves wasting our time</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.359" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">or these not accomplishing our</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.859" end="00:03:04.439" style="s2">objectives because we don&#39;t conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">the order of magnitude of what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.439" end="00:03:08.459" style="s2">be brought and to a lesser extent its</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">directionality before we go about trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.459" end="00:03:17.569" style="s2">to do things ok - a little harder this</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">is also obviously fraught with</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.569" end="00:03:22.799" style="s2">complexity and in nuanced detail so here</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">I have the broad brush and the broad</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.799" end="00:03:25.949" style="s2">brush is something like okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">order of magnitude that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.949" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:31.079" style="s2">how big a challenge are we dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">right now if we want to affect a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.079" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">change or at least if we want to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">know save the kid on the tracks what do</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:40.310" style="s2">we need to accomplish well what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:40.310" style="s2">energy do we need to bring to bear</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">so to maybe just do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:49.109" style="s2">double-clicking we can take some</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">examples so one example might be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.109" end="00:03:57.349" style="s2">implications of cell phones and social</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:04:00.049" style="s2">media technology in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.349" end="00:04:02.549" style="s2">capitalism right so the competition and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.049" end="00:04:04.859" style="s2">and Metcalfe&#39;s law right the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.549" end="00:04:06.479" style="s2">that the more things attract them were</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.859" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2">viable they get which creates lock-in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.479" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">effects and the interface between</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">Metcalfe&#39;s law and capitalism or Locke</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:13.829" style="s2">and effects generate huge amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">flows of money which generate more</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.829" end="00:04:17.039" style="s2">capacity to maintain the integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:18.780" style="s2">the existence of the thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.039" end="00:04:20.810" style="s2">locked in so it&#39;s being maintained</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.780" end="00:04:23.060" style="s2">through two dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.810" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">combine that with say for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.060" end="00:04:27.650" style="s2">sophisticated advances in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:31.640" style="s2">science and in artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.650" end="00:04:34.730" style="s2">and the you know the competitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.640" end="00:04:36.200" style="s2">landscape is attention to generate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.730" end="00:04:37.790" style="s2">results that my friend Tristan Harris</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.200" end="00:04:39.920" style="s2">has been continually bringing up which</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.790" end="00:04:41.510" style="s2">is that we were becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.920" end="00:04:42.620" style="s2">progressively addicted in particular our</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.510" end="00:04:46.250" style="s2">kids are becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.620" end="00:04:49.300" style="s2">progressively addicted to mobile social</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.250" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">media Facebook snapchat etc and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:54.740" style="s2">when you kind of dig into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">consequences at the level of neurology</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.740" end="00:04:59.210" style="s2">at the node level of like losing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.890" style="s2">capacity to even have a sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.210" end="00:05:03.169" style="s2">and self esteem outside of these weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.890" end="00:05:04.850" style="s2">social signaling dynamics the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.169" end="00:05:08.600" style="s2">consequences are in fact really</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.850" end="00:05:11.030" style="s2">significantly catastrophic so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.600" end="00:05:13.190" style="s2">train called this big complex of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.030" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">capitalism and technology and Metcalfe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.190" end="00:05:18.970" style="s2">law and cognitive science and our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:21.650" style="s2">inability to inhibit ourselves from</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.650" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">and the generation of kids on a global</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">right so that&#39;s one I can Heather how</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:39.020" style="s2">about the the the dynamic between the</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.370" end="00:05:43.880" style="s2">environment takes any particular problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.440" end="00:05:46.310" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example this question of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.880" end="00:05:49.030" style="s2">when whether when and how to wear masks</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.310" end="00:05:52.600" style="s2">or whether when and how to have vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.030" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">and takes what is in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.600" end="00:05:56.330" style="s2">technical problem or at least can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">addressed meaningfully as a technical</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.330" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">problem but converts it into a political</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.850" end="00:06:02.900" style="s2">problem and then converts it into a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">hyper polarized political problem in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.900" end="00:06:07.669" style="s2">context of a real event some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.930" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">hyperpolarization piece and has</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.410" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">implications for each choice that we</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.790" end="00:08:11.880" style="s2">kind of a category one and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.090" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">the the Civil War was maybe a category</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.880" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">three and the Revolutionary War is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">category four maybe this is a category</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:26.190" style="s2">five in an order of magnitude so what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:27.900" style="s2">would propose is that the the training</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.190" end="00:08:30.840" style="s2">that we are dealing with the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.900" end="00:08:33.410" style="s2">challenge that we are faced with is of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.840" end="00:08:38.340" style="s2">that order of magnitude and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.410" end="00:08:40.280" style="s2">the solution to the problem must be of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.340" end="00:08:42.570" style="s2">that order of magnitude or larger and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.280" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">anything that is of a smaller order of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.570" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">magnitude is either a waste of time or</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">could be a tactical way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">buying US time which is fine like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:56.060" style="s2">need as much time as we can get all</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:09:01.240" style="s2">right three this is this is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.060" end="00:09:03.590" style="s2">working how the do we pull that off</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.240" end="00:09:06.620" style="s2">so here I&#39;m just so going to propose</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.590" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">something this is my suggestion on how</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.620" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">we can solve that problem and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:16.280" style="s2">something about the the mode of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:18.380" style="s2">suggestion that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.280" end="00:09:20.450" style="s2">suggestion itself which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.380" end="00:09:24.290" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand at all what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.450" end="00:09:27.550" style="s2">about to say that&#39;s kind of okay because</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.290" end="00:09:32.330" style="s2">part of the point is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.550" end="00:09:34.250" style="s2">certain people who are or at least in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.330" end="00:09:36.440" style="s2">proposal in my proposition I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.250" end="00:09:38.360" style="s2">talking to a couple of folks here maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.440" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">self a million but not the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.360" end="00:09:43.820" style="s2">population and and that groups job is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:47.180" style="s2">do a hell of a lot better job than I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.820" end="00:09:49.940" style="s2">doing and to bring in more okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.180" end="00:09:53.690" style="s2">proposition is something like this big</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2">hairy complex problems require a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.690" end="00:09:57.890" style="s2">different kind of mind a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">of consciousness I&#39;ve referred to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.890" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">variously as collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:03.800" style="s2">distributed cognition other people talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.660" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">about it differently</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.210" end="00:10:13.330" style="s2">indigenous knowing and it just knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.980" end="00:10:15.950" style="s2">intrinsically works in the context of</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.950" end="00:10:23.390" style="s2">involved in very specific ways the human</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.290" end="00:10:26.930" style="s2">consciousness the human mind developed</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.390" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">in the context of of an obligate group</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.100" end="00:10:36.380" style="s2">members of some group and infecting a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.670" end="00:10:41.030" style="s2">pretty large group like that dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.380" end="00:10:43.610" style="s2">notion of 150 people seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.030" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">fundamental all right so we we fit into</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.610" end="00:10:48.080" style="s2">a context that has a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:50.690" style="s2">people and here&#39;s the thing we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.080" end="00:10:53.660" style="s2">all the same and we&#39;re very much not</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.690" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">interchangeable like we we each are well</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.660" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">suited to some subset of the different</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.920" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">functioning of the human trial okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.820" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">the notion is something like this this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:11.330" style="s2">is a bit of a journey but here to follow</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:14.450" style="s2">me on this the thing we have to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.330" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">have to actually reach rival eyes and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.450" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that in the stupid sense I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.940" style="s2">mean that in a much more nuanced sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">we tend to do something else</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.940" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">we like simulated tribes and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">mess we have to actually find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:31.220" style="s2">actually retry by like really Rico here</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:32.960" style="s2">with a richly connected the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.220" end="00:11:35.480" style="s2">coherence is crucians like the key the</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.480" end="00:11:42.220" style="s2">contains all of the different subtypes</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.210" end="00:11:47.089" style="s2">of humaneness that we need so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.220" end="00:11:49.250" style="s2">robbing at tribal and in that context to</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.250" end="00:11:58.330" style="s2">means recovering recreating tribal like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:12:00.140" style="s2">relationships and this means for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.330" end="00:12:02.890" style="s2">rediscovering some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.140" end="00:12:04.520" style="s2">fundamental roles in that context and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.890" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">the one of them to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.520" end="00:12:09.650" style="s2">specifically right now to one is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:13.339" style="s2">something like shaman the other is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.650" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">something like say elder or chief or</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.339" end="00:12:16.580" style="s2">something like that and obviously at</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:21.080" style="s2">this point the language is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.580" end="00:12:24.250" style="s2">very sketchy we could play slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.080" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">differently one role has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.250" end="00:12:32.230" style="s2">capacity and responsibility for engaging</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:35.690" style="s2">in the thing that tyson refers to as</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.230" end="00:12:37.310" style="s2">turn around or turn about other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:39.830" style="s2">like forest land ii think talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.310" end="00:12:41.510" style="s2">this concept of transcendent design and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.830" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">without what I would say is something</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.510" end="00:12:46.760" style="s2">like the ability to perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">transcendent operator the generator</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.760" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">function the highly abstract perceive it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:55.220" style="s2">well like actually be able to operate in</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:12:59.540" style="s2">that mode and then to be able to support</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.220" end="00:13:02.870" style="s2">that into a capacity to be actualized</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.540" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">and that when I say this shamanic type I</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.870" end="00:13:07.550" style="s2">kind of that&#39;s what I mean that function</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.760" end="00:13:08.930" style="s2">that capacity and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.550" end="00:13:10.310" style="s2">capacity ended by the with many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.930" end="00:13:12.699" style="s2">course but there&#39;s another capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.310" end="00:13:17.300" style="s2">which has to do with something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.699" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">representing the embodied whole my</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.300" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">thinking this is leadership individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">who cannot help but prioritize the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:28.579" style="s2">well-being of the whole tribe over</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:33.170" style="s2">themselves or any distinct individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.579" end="00:13:35.180" style="s2">and in whom that fact is has a felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.170" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">reality in the other members of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.180" end="00:13:41.000" style="s2">tribe so there&#39;s a sense of representing</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:42.769" style="s2">the whole in this individual so I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.000" end="00:13:46.730" style="s2">that to describe the the chief for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.769" end="00:13:52.009" style="s2">king or the leader or the queen in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.730" end="00:13:55.880" style="s2">function okay so the move is something</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.009" end="00:14:00.500" style="s2">like this the what the how and the who</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.880" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">are many ways co-creating so at some</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:06.649" style="s2">level there&#39;s a way to articulate a what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:09.800" style="s2">at a level of abstraction that is too</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.649" end="00:14:12.350" style="s2">high an abstraction to be perceived by</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.800" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">most people and is therefore not useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.350" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">at that point however it can be preceded</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:20.860" style="s2">by members of the shamanic class and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:22.730" style="s2">they can begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.860" end="00:14:25.399" style="s2">collaborating around that level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.730" end="00:14:28.579" style="s2">abstraction here is a solution the at</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.399" end="00:14:31.220" style="s2">least in principle is designed to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.579" end="00:14:35.269" style="s2">both the order of magnitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.220" end="00:14:37.069" style="s2">directionality necessary to address the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.269" end="00:14:39.260" style="s2">challenge that we&#39;re dealing with and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.069" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">this is going to be a massive systemic</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.260" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">shift alright it&#39;s going to be a shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:49.250" style="s2">again of the order of magnitude of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:53.980" style="s2">know the 15th and 16th centuries then</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.250" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">that who begins to have enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.980" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">completeness and enough clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:01.790" style="s2">perhaps quality of expression to begin</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">bringing in this next category of who</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.790" end="00:15:09.709" style="s2">and these these chieftains these Queens</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:11.779" style="s2">who have hopefully an ability to also</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.709" end="00:15:16.360" style="s2">perceive that probably at a more</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.779" end="00:15:18.529" style="s2">embodied way but in whom is vested the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.360" end="00:15:22.220" style="s2">responsibility and the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.529" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">generate coherence among the people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.220" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">among the the body of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:28.660" style="s2">whole the tribe the rest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:31.180" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a collaboration between</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.660" end="00:15:34.910" style="s2">the shamanic type and the chieftain type</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.180" end="00:15:37.130" style="s2">in increasingly more richly articulating</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.910" end="00:15:40.190" style="s2">the what and then increasingly more</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.130" end="00:15:41.690" style="s2">fully embodying the what into into house</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">I the chieftain category is going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.690" end="00:15:47.210" style="s2">have a fastest superior capacity both to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:48.950" style="s2">articulate and to execute on but how</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.210" end="00:15:51.020" style="s2">then we start bringing in other types</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.950" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">right there are key elements this other</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.020" end="00:15:55.610" style="s2">type ologies that have capacities to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:58.820" style="s2">things like implementation and strategy</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.610" end="00:16:01.400" style="s2">and maintaining integrity and conflict</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.820" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">resolution and all the other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.400" end="00:16:11.450" style="s2">that&#39;s part of human II and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:15.310" style="s2">recovery of a fundamental topology of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.450" end="00:16:18.200" style="s2">the human tribe that has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.310" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">contemplate the order of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.200" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">complexity and intensity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">directionality necessary to address the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:26.930" style="s2">fundamental problem which has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">progressive process where the more the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.930" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">who is real the more the what becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:35.180" style="s2">real which increases the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:36.650" style="s2">attract and orient a more real who and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.180" end="00:16:38.540" style="s2">you start getting a positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.650" end="00:16:41.900" style="s2">loop until the house starts showing up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.540" end="00:16:45.760" style="s2">and then and then it&#39;s done okay now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.900" end="00:16:50.740" style="s2">warned you that&#39;s pretty darn abstract I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.760" end="00:16:53.000" style="s2">myself can can prefer or I can generate</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.740" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">instantiations of the abstraction in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.000" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">practical but they&#39;re not right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">not good enough they&#39;re not rich enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:05.810" style="s2">they&#39;re useful as examples to orient</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">people and help them begin to sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.810" end="00:17:09.110" style="s2">themselves oh right okay that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:12.620" style="s2">thing I get what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.110" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">maybe more like this so the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.620" end="00:17:18.140" style="s2">course is we need more who and when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">do it pretty quickly which is the point</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.140" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">of this series</p>
