<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">arisen at this time is that we really</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:24.619" style="s2">did have the emergence of this new stage</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">of development and it really is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.619" end="00:00:31.830" style="s2">radically relativistic radically</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">egalitarian pretty great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">emphasis on equal outcome and she&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">differences at all as the product of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">oppression or discrimination and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">what so many of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">web people are fighting against they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">saying look it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that some</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">of that is oppression no doubt but</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">they&#39;re also other reasons that we see</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">these differences and they might have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">do with different interests and male and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">female for example some people would say</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">that that is is a caricature and most</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">people on the Left don&#39;t believe those</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:19.400" style="s2">things well then here&#39;s the question why</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">is it that this moderate reasonable EFT</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.400" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell these shrill voices to shut</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">up they&#39;re terrified so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:33.229" style="s2">you get you sit down with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">automatically you strengthen them</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.229" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">there&#39;s no automatic maybe they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">strengthened if their ideas are good and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;d ever argue that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t sit down with someone I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">my main point is whether people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">being challenged enough because and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">goes back to my point before about has</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">has it shifted because because now there</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">are expectations I mean we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">this for Joe Rogan I think we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">this with you as well that there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">expectations that you will hold people</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">to account in a way that when you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">upstart kind of alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">channel yes we&#39;re not there right so as</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">I said earlier but look the bigger you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:09.509" style="s2">get the more relevant you get the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:10.450" style="s2">haters are going to come out but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.509" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">more that legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.450" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll come out - and again I address</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:19.630" style="s2">this all the time what do you think&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:21.459" style="s2">the most legitimate criticism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.630" end="00:02:23.860" style="s2">really for me to say what the legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.459" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">criticism of me if someone wants to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.860" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">that they don&#39;t like the way I interview</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:28.330" style="s2">or that I don&#39;t ask hard enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">questions or something like that well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.330" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">suppose that is a legitimate criticism</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">of me it&#39;s not the way I like doing my</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:38.590" style="s2">business the nature of the media has</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:40.660" style="s2">changed so much that once you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.590" end="00:02:43.239" style="s2">at a particular kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">source or a certain kind of world you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.239" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">just get more and more feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">supports that view and there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.299" style="s2">more reason to distrust everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:54.130" style="s2">so we&#39;re all learning how to distrust</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.299" end="00:02:56.769" style="s2">everybody else and to confirm not</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.130" end="00:03:00.430" style="s2">conform to our particular worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.769" end="00:03:02.530" style="s2">that arose the sense that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.430" end="00:03:04.450" style="s2">larger consensus reality that&#39;s weaving</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.530" end="00:03:06.250" style="s2">us together so we&#39;re kind of let loose</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.450" end="00:03:08.049" style="s2">and this very fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.250" end="00:03:10.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like people used to complain about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.049" end="00:03:13.060" style="s2">post-modernism in the 80s and early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.569" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like no now we&#39;re now we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">in it now we&#39;re living real relativism</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">one of the ideas that led me to his book</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">maps of meaning early on was just from</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:27.400" style="s2">reading different philosophers I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:30.280" style="s2">came to this conclusion that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.400" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">have two people in the same room you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.280" end="00:03:34.030" style="s2">know in the same place at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:36.040" style="s2">coffee table in front of them but your</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.030" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">belief system and the way you frame the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.040" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">world informs reality to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">where we can literally be in two</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:43.450" style="s2">different realities even if we&#39;re beside</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.670" style="s2">each other and this was like a big aha</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.450" end="00:03:47.769" style="s2">moment for me of well we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.670" end="00:03:50.019" style="s2">screwed like how can people really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.769" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">understand each other and resolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.019" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">conflicts and I remember that being the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:57.489" style="s2">initial thing that somehow led me I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:04:01.510" style="s2">think through some google search to maps</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.489" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">of meaning so it&#39;s interesting how I you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.510" end="00:04:06.639" style="s2">know later found myself working on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:09.400" style="s2">film about Jordan&#39;s comments on Bill c16</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.639" end="00:04:10.660" style="s2">involving into all of this other these</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.400" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">other issues of political correctness</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.660" end="00:04:17.139" style="s2">but with with this idea of culture war</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:19.720" style="s2">looming underneath all of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.139" end="00:04:22.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been interested in stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.720" end="00:04:25.090" style="s2">do with psychology of almost every kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.120" end="00:04:29.740" style="s2">and I&#39;m also interested in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.090" end="00:04:34.569" style="s2">stuff in a very weakened form which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.740" end="00:04:37.750" style="s2">what I what I call why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.569" end="00:04:41.349" style="s2">is there a purpose of life and of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.750" end="00:04:45.009" style="s2">the current scientific paradigms there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.349" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">no purpose at all consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.009" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">epiphenomenon caused by chemical it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">chemical reaction which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">complete nonsense it reminds me of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">George Orwell once said which was only</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:04.120" style="s2">an intellectual could believe that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:06.610" style="s2">are two types of hierarchies and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.120" end="00:05:08.699" style="s2">what Greene absolutely overlooks and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:11.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.699" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">there are Dominator hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.530" end="00:05:16.599" style="s2">there are growth hierarchies or</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">actualization hierarchies Dominator</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.599" end="00:05:21.940" style="s2">hierarchies are all the horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:24.130" style="s2">that postmodern say they are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:27.719" style="s2">tyrannical their power structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.130" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">they&#39;re oppressive they&#39;re the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.719" end="00:05:34.930" style="s2">almost every nightmare you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:39.219" style="s2">in human history and you want to do as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.930" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">much as you can to get rid of those as</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.219" end="00:05:44.620" style="s2">much as you possibly can but then there</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.770" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">are growth hierarchies those are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.620" end="00:05:50.199" style="s2">opposite of done literally the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:52.210" style="s2">of Dominator hierarchies in a dominate</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.199" end="00:05:53.409" style="s2">of those the same thing as what Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.210" end="00:05:58.599" style="s2">would describe as hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.409" end="00:06:01.690" style="s2">competence close to it the Dominator</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.599" end="00:06:03.340" style="s2">hierarchies the higher you go and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.690" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">Dominator hierarchy the more people you</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.340" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">can oppress the more people you can hurt</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:11.289" style="s2">the more exclusive you are the higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:14.219" style="s2">you go in a growth hierarchy the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.289" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">inclusive you are you actually are</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.219" end="00:06:18.909" style="s2">including more people we saw this simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:22.330" style="s2">developmental model it goes in just me</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.909" end="00:06:26.259" style="s2">to a group to all groups to all humans</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.330" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">to integrating all of those that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.259" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">growth highroad</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.399" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">you know I started being like okay Kent</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.929" end="00:06:35.860" style="s2">I can&#39;t trust news to be true because</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:38.709" style="s2">news is narrative warfare and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:40.959" style="s2">trust science without actually really</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.709" end="00:06:43.839" style="s2">looking at what was the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.959" end="00:06:45.550" style="s2">employed how was it funded what were the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.839" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">axioms that the team was using what were</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.550" end="00:06:48.429" style="s2">the logical transforms am i seeing all</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:53.589" style="s2">of their data or was a cherry pick data</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.809" end="00:07:00.339" style="s2">noise sources that I can&#39;t offload some</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.769" end="00:07:17.319" style="s2">that and what would it take to fix that</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.559" end="00:07:28.149" style="s2">couple things here but this goes deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.419" end="00:07:29.619" style="s2">and how do we make good choices if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.149" end="00:07:33.399" style="s2">don&#39;t have good sense mate well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.619" end="00:07:35.319" style="s2">obviously we can&#39;t but due to increasing</p>
