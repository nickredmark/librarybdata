<p begin="00:01:43.190" end="00:01:48.200" style="s2">back in the day in the 1990s is a senior</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.830" end="00:01:50.420" style="s2">technology executive it was pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.200" end="00:01:53.540" style="s2">an overpriced show sold the dumb</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.540" end="00:01:57.799" style="s2">did you learn from that that led you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.770" end="00:01:59.720" style="s2">condemn it oh it goes back way way then</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.799" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">I think what you actually saw and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:03.830" style="s2">obviously your experience was people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.880" end="00:02:05.659" style="s2">focused on technology so there were two</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.830" end="00:02:08.090" style="s2">main schools of thought around then one</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.659" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">was it was all about codification and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.090" end="00:02:10.850" style="s2">that means stuff into databases and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">other group which</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.850" end="00:02:15.320" style="s2">myself pre-cut pre-second the like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">basically argued decision support was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.320" end="00:02:19.910" style="s2">lot more complex than that you had to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">take into account cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.910" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">you had to take into the other way</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:27.410" style="s2">people made decisions so that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:30.550" style="s2">of like where we were and that fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.410" end="00:02:33.890" style="s2">soon morphed into work on narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">complexity theory and then that got me</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.890" end="00:02:39.170" style="s2">heavily involved in DARPA programs</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:41.300" style="s2">before and after 9/11 looking at weak</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.170" end="00:02:44.090" style="s2">signal detection and support and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.300" end="00:02:46.430" style="s2">decision-making in complex policy</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.090" end="00:02:48.260" style="s2">environments so I think you may have had</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.430" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">some bad experiences there and you may</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">be spending too much time with the top</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">sales consultants rather than people</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:56.060" style="s2">understand the subject yeah fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:02:58.060" style="s2">I never got gold into doing such</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.060" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">projects but I know lots of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.060" end="00:03:04.190" style="s2">contemporaries who did and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.160" style="s2">know the publication&#39;s of the year were</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.190" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">full of you know the miracles of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.160" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">knowledge management now as you say it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:14.330" style="s2">was all very naive attempts to over</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">codify what is nothing like an easily</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.330" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">codified process which actually brings</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:20.300" style="s2">me to another one of my comments I saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">in your original Harvard Business Review</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:25.550" style="s2">article you talk about what I&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.700" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">naive Newtonian ISM people who never get</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.550" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">beyond the 13 year old nerds belief that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">with all of the data about position and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:34.040" style="s2">velocity of everything in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">we could predict the future I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.040" end="00:03:38.120" style="s2">saw that again and again in corporate</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:40.490" style="s2">America and a lack of knowledge of even</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">basic concepts such as deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.490" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">chaos what&#39;s it like out there today in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:46.100" style="s2">the world of business and government you</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:47.390" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen much difference some of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.100" end="00:03:49.730" style="s2">people are still taking a linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.390" end="00:03:52.490" style="s2">approach to causality and to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.730" end="00:03:55.340" style="s2">lost the systems thinkers guys there as</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.490" end="00:03:57.020" style="s2">well so the assumption is you can if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.340" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">get the input right you can define the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.020" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">output or that you should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:04.430" style="s2">forecast or back castes to a future</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:06.730" style="s2">State I think the work we&#39;ve done which</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.430" end="00:04:09.020" style="s2">is primarily based on complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.730" end="00:04:09.800" style="s2">which is different from deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.020" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.800" end="00:04:15.650" style="s2">yeah complexity theory and human systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.030" style="s2">is sometimes known as the science for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.650" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">sin</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.030" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">uncertainty in which you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:23.950" style="s2">the present and you can map the coherent</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">pathways from the present but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.950" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">define an outcome indeed you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">complexity science guy myself I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:33.760" style="s2">very clear about the distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:36.010" style="s2">mentioned deterministic chaos because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.760" end="00:04:38.110" style="s2">call that the baby first step you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.010" end="00:04:41.050" style="s2">once somebody understands that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.110" end="00:04:43.480" style="s2">deterministic chaos is real they ought</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.050" end="00:04:45.640" style="s2">to throw out their naive Newtonian ISM</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.480" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">you know it&#39;s amazing today to me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.640" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">today people could still hang on to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:53.020" style="s2">in positions of authority yet they</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">clearly do I think this area is where it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.020" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">still applies I mean the point about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:04:58.690" style="s2">can every framework is to say that human</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:00.790" style="s2">beings have learned for example in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.690" end="00:05:03.669" style="s2">traffic management or operating theaters</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.790" end="00:05:05.380" style="s2">to create highly predictable Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.669" end="00:05:06.640" style="s2">systems and there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.380" end="00:05:10.390" style="s2">them provided we don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.640" end="00:05:12.580" style="s2">Universal I think deterministic chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.390" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">not necessarily the best next step</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.580" end="00:05:16.570" style="s2">because it tends people to think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">they can use agent-based models or</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.570" end="00:05:21.390" style="s2">simulation or AI and they&#39;re really not</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">dealing with highly interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.390" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">systems I prefer to get people into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">fundamental distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.530" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">complicated and complex between systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">where you can define a future States and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:35.530" style="s2">systems where you can only understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">the present and then worry about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.530" end="00:05:38.890" style="s2">other stuff later yeah we&#39;ll get to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.690" style="s2">in just a minute that&#39;s actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.890" end="00:05:43.020" style="s2">be the heart of what I&#39;m gonna be asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.690" end="00:05:45.550" style="s2">you about but before we go there</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.020" end="00:05:47.770" style="s2">complexity science clearly informs your</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.550" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">combine it with cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.440" end="00:06:25.650" style="s2">and basically say that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">aren&#39;t ants so I think quite early on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.650" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">and I remember a big debate with Walter</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">Freeman as to Katherine and Brian Arthur</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:33.510" style="s2">over dinner in San Jose many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:35.850" style="s2">and I think what all of us were saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.510" end="00:06:38.520" style="s2">is the study of complexity in human</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.850" end="00:06:41.699" style="s2">systems is different from the study of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.520" end="00:06:42.930" style="s2">complexity in termites nests and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.699" end="00:06:45.660" style="s2">requires us to take a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.930" end="00:06:47.130" style="s2">transdisciplinary approach so that part</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.660" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about people like Freeman</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.130" end="00:06:51.570" style="s2">for decision-making you know you talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:53.820" style="s2">about Chalmers there&#39;s a whole body of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.570" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">academic and other influences Chalmers</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.820" end="00:06:57.600" style="s2">to me David Chalmers a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:07:00.750" style="s2">slight confusion and talking about David</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.600" end="00:07:02.970" style="s2">Chandler Oh Chandler sorry not Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.750" end="00:07:04.830" style="s2">okay no I am a philosopher so the hard</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.970" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">problem is one that complexity gives us</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.830" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">different insights um it&#39;s one Attard</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:12.510" style="s2">right well nice complexities and as</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:14.550" style="s2">mutually ontological ontological a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.510" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">diverse systems to co-exist so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:19.350" style="s2">few issues like free will you can deal</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:20.610" style="s2">with no Chandler&#39;s just his latest book</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.350" end="00:07:23.310" style="s2">his and on to politics and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.610" end="00:07:25.410" style="s2">interesting so he&#39;s talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.310" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">the sort of world we now live in is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.410" end="00:07:29.100" style="s2">radically different in terms of the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:31.289" style="s2">we make decisions and he&#39;s coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.100" end="00:07:33.510" style="s2">political science background so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.289" end="00:07:35.310" style="s2">drawn on near the biological in their</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.510" end="00:07:37.169" style="s2">anthropology this is your the trend of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.310" end="00:07:39.780" style="s2">anthropology a whole bunch of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.169" end="00:07:41.550" style="s2">stuff and context is here very good with</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.780" end="00:07:45.450" style="s2">that as a little bit of groundwork in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.550" end="00:07:47.610" style="s2">place maybe you could dig in now and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.450" end="00:07:50.520" style="s2">know really tell our audience about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.610" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">Keynesian can even framework keep in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:55.320" style="s2">mind our audience is smart hey you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:57.030" style="s2">morons get out of here but most will not</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.320" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">have a background in complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.030" end="00:08:02.310" style="s2">so please take it slowly</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:04.710" style="s2">okay so conniving is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.310" end="00:08:07.470" style="s2">fundamental divide into three types of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.710" end="00:08:10.229" style="s2">system ordered systems complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.470" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">and chaotic systems and it comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.229" end="00:08:14.070" style="s2">principle that there&#39;s a phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:17.130" style="s2">between those types it&#39;s not a gradation</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.070" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">is a phase shift and it&#39;s important here</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.130" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">that chaos tends to be defined</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:22.979" style="s2">differently in social science from</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:24.750" style="s2">physical so I&#39;ll run through my</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.979" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">definitions and make sure we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.750" end="00:08:28.949" style="s2">the same language so an order system is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:31.650" style="s2">one which has a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.949" end="00:08:34.200" style="s2">constraint to the point where everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.650" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">is predictable so in the UK we drive on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.200" end="00:08:36.170" style="s2">the left in the US you drive on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:38.580" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.170" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">human beings have an ability to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.580" end="00:08:43.470" style="s2">constraints to produce predictability</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">and the you know the drive on the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.470" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">drive on the right is an example of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:49.020" style="s2">watching the conniving is called an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:51.090" style="s2">obvious approach toward either</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.020" end="00:08:53.490" style="s2">relationship between cause and effect is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.090" end="00:08:56.010" style="s2">self-evident everybody can understand it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.490" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">everybody buys into it so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.010" end="00:09:00.270" style="s2">domain of best practice as a single</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">right way of doing things we sense we</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.270" end="00:09:05.070" style="s2">categorize respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:07.830" style="s2">we have rigid constraints the other type</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.070" end="00:09:10.770" style="s2">of order is complicated and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.830" end="00:09:13.650" style="s2">at for experts it may be obvious but for</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.770" end="00:09:15.420" style="s2">the decision maker it isn&#39;t so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.650" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">self-evident so you have to carry out</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.420" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">some sort of investigation bring in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:22.710" style="s2">expertise you effectively sense analyze</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">respond but there is a right answer it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.710" end="00:09:27.420" style="s2">can be discovered but you may discover</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">the answer within range of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.420" end="00:09:31.740" style="s2">you may not have to be precise which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:34.020" style="s2">why we talk about that as the main of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.740" end="00:09:36.690" style="s2">good practice not best practice so for</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.020" end="00:09:39.300" style="s2">example a medical practitioner should be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.690" end="00:09:41.190" style="s2">allowed a degree of flexibility in what</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.300" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">decisions they make about patients they</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.190" end="00:09:44.400" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be forced into a single route</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:48.030" style="s2">and that would be an example of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.400" end="00:09:49.740" style="s2">complicated if you over constrain an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.030" end="00:09:52.170" style="s2">order system and we have a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.740" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">in IBM so the expense system was so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.170" end="00:09:57.930" style="s2">ridiculous that people found workarounds</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:10:00.060" style="s2">for example claiming for a taxi fare and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.930" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">using that to cover food for staff</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.060" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">working late at night and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.010" end="00:10:06.810" style="s2">classic classic case so if you over</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.830" end="00:10:08.610" style="s2">constrain the system language is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.810" end="00:10:11.430" style="s2">naturally constrain able sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.610" end="00:10:13.290" style="s2">brake source of fragments into chaos so</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.430" end="00:10:15.840" style="s2">that&#39;s called a catastrophic fold and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.290" end="00:10:18.390" style="s2">the bottom of Canarian is shown as a fol</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.840" end="00:10:20.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a reference to Remy Tom so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:23.460" style="s2">disastrous if you fall into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.760" end="00:10:26.070" style="s2">accidentally then the model is out sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.460" end="00:10:28.140" style="s2">respond you have to recover very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.070" end="00:10:29.910" style="s2">you see that for example you know when</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.140" end="00:10:32.790" style="s2">in old industries collapse almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.910" end="00:10:34.770" style="s2">overnight because it&#39;s what Peyton</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.790" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">Christensen called competence induced</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.770" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">failure they&#39;re so good at the old</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">paradigm they don&#39;t see the change</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:42.600" style="s2">coming so when the change happens is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:44.100" style="s2">catastrophic a complex system on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">other hand is one which has what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.100" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">called enabling constraints so</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:48.870" style="s2">everything is tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:51.000" style="s2">they&#39;re connected with everything else</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.870" end="00:10:53.250" style="s2">but the connections aren&#39;t fully known</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.000" end="00:10:55.380" style="s2">and one of the concepts I created is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.250" end="00:10:58.290" style="s2">called a dark constraint I&#39;m a reference</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.380" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">to dark energy in cosmology so we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.290" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">see the impact of something but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:04.920" style="s2">actually see what we have where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.390" style="s2">impact is coming from so in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.920" end="00:11:08.760" style="s2">adaptive system the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.390" end="00:11:11.520" style="s2">understand it is to probe it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.760" end="00:11:14.100" style="s2">experiment in it but critically you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.520" end="00:11:16.500" style="s2">to experiment in parallel which by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.100" end="00:11:19.860" style="s2">way gives us a significant conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.500" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">resolution device one of my definitions</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.860" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">of complexity is if the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">supports conflicting hypotheses of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">action and you can&#39;t resolve those</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:31.500" style="s2">hypotheses within the time frame for</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:34.410" style="s2">decision on an evidence base then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.500" end="00:11:36.149" style="s2">situation is complex so we think can</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.410" end="00:11:38.130" style="s2">having you don&#39;t try and resolve it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.149" end="00:11:39.899" style="s2">construct a safe to fail micro</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.130" end="00:11:43.050" style="s2">experiment around each coherent</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.899" end="00:11:44.940" style="s2">hypothesis you run them in parallel that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.050" end="00:11:47.089" style="s2">change the dynamics of the space and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.940" end="00:11:51.029" style="s2">then the solution starts to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.089" end="00:11:53.790" style="s2">the final domain is the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.029" end="00:11:55.620" style="s2">disorder which is the central space and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.790" end="00:11:56.940" style="s2">that&#39;s kinda like the state of not</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.620" end="00:11:58.500" style="s2">knowing which of the other systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.940" end="00:12:00.150" style="s2">you&#39;re in then you might enter that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.500" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2">accidently or you might enter it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.150" end="00:12:05.610" style="s2">deliberately but in fact it&#39;s a type of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.700" end="00:12:08.010" style="s2">in authenticity so if your natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.610" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">tendency is to bureaucracy you&#39;re likely</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.010" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">to impose order when it&#39;s inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:14.640" style="s2">yeah if your natural tendency is towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">complexity and emergence you may not</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.640" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">impose order when it&#39;s appropriate and</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.640" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">into the distinction between just the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:20.690" style="s2">complicated and the complex I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.470" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">read in one of your essays that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.690" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">described complicated as something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:27.620" style="s2">could in principle be taken apart and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">put back together again</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.620" end="00:13:32.510" style="s2">while complex that could never be true</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.430" style="s2">yeah a complicated system is the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">its parts so you can solve problems by</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.430" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">breaking things down and solving them</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:40.640" style="s2">separately in a complex system the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.770" style="s2">properties of the whole are the result</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.640" end="00:13:45.560" style="s2">of interaction between the parts and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.770" end="00:13:47.210" style="s2">their linkages and the constraints in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.560" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">fact in a complex system how things</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.210" end="00:13:52.340" style="s2">connect is more important than what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:54.740" style="s2">are so the properties of that emergent</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.340" end="00:13:56.420" style="s2">pattern can never be decomposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.740" end="00:13:58.670" style="s2">original parts gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.420" end="00:14:00.110" style="s2">and because I was thinking about this I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.670" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">thought of another distinction I thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.110" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2">I&#39;d run by you and see what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:09.860" style="s2">that at least in a purely complicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">system one generally assumes that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.860" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">components the complicated system are</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">not antagonistically adaptive you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">ie one would never have to assume that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:23.450" style="s2">your carburetor showing my age there</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:25.610" style="s2">with that reference isn&#39;t going to sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.450" end="00:14:28.100" style="s2">of perversely develop better and better</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.610" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">ways to keep the engine from running you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.100" end="00:14:31.640" style="s2">can assume that the carburetor is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:34.310" style="s2">relatively static device it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.640" end="00:14:36.380" style="s2">strategic or adaptive element is that a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.310" end="00:14:39.200" style="s2">useful distinction about the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.380" end="00:14:40.790" style="s2">world yeah a car engine is and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.200" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">complicated systems tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.790" end="00:14:44.540" style="s2">engineered as well these don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.660" style="s2">see you so much in nature unless you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.540" end="00:14:49.520" style="s2">highly static constraint relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.660" end="00:14:51.410" style="s2">in a context adapter system something</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.520" end="00:14:52.100" style="s2">which was beneficial one day can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.410" end="00:14:55.670" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.100" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">I mean classic examples is symbiosis so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.670" end="00:15:00.530" style="s2">all symbols actually start off as</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:03.470" style="s2">parasites and then they Co evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.530" end="00:15:05.240" style="s2">Co adapt with their host yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.470" end="00:15:05.900" style="s2">engine end up is symbiotic and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.240" end="00:15:08.690" style="s2">totally to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.900" end="00:15:11.240" style="s2">so the stomach bacteria you rely on to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.690" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">actually how your digestion actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.240" end="00:15:14.960" style="s2">killed a lot of your ancestors off</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:16.780" style="s2">before they actually go home yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.960" end="00:15:18.860" style="s2">course it goes the other way right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.780" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">bacteria you can&#39;t live without us now</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.860" end="00:15:24.170" style="s2">also they&#39;ve given up a fair big part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">their genetic code so they can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.170" end="00:15:28.580" style="s2">processing of raw material anymore they</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:30.770" style="s2">have to have our chemicals do it for</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.580" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">them so it&#39;s really a mutualism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.770" end="00:15:34.100" style="s2">quite interesting that the bowler at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:35.720" style="s2">moment because one of the reasons is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.100" end="00:15:38.180" style="s2">dangerous is not killing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.720" end="00:15:39.770" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s starting to it out ah ha</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.180" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">yeah when it kills everybody it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.770" end="00:15:47.300" style="s2">gonna spread right another thought about</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:49.370" style="s2">complicated and complex which is talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.300" end="00:15:51.880" style="s2">about in circles of them some of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.370" end="00:15:54.770" style="s2">I work with is that in general a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.880" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">complicated system will be embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.770" end="00:16:00.200" style="s2">complex system you know let&#39;s take for</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.110" end="00:16:02.870" style="s2">instance a 1950 style command and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.200" end="00:16:05.870" style="s2">control assembly line factory yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.870" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">that&#39;s you know a high example of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.870" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">complicated artifact and yet for it to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:13.010" style="s2">be meaningful it has to be embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">marketplace of suppliers customers</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.010" end="00:16:17.570" style="s2">competitors and substitutes all who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.220" end="00:16:21.380" style="s2">interlocking in a co-evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:23.090" style="s2">network which is certainly complex one</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.380" end="00:16:25.160" style="s2">of things I didn&#39;t see in your writings</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.090" end="00:16:27.230" style="s2">maybe I missed them I will confess to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.160" end="00:16:30.340" style="s2">not have read them all I read a fair</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.230" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">amount was the the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.340" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">complicatedness embedded in complexity I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:37.760" style="s2">think is that if you look at it I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:41.300" style="s2">say it&#39;s self evidence but we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.760" end="00:16:42.830" style="s2">point it out and any-any highly</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:44.390" style="s2">structured engineered system works</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.830" end="00:16:47.030" style="s2">within human dynamics and human</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.390" end="00:16:48.590" style="s2">interaction yeah I think it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.030" end="00:16:50.030" style="s2">possible for it to be the other way</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.590" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">around actually though I think complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.030" end="00:16:53.780" style="s2">systems can be embedded in complicated</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:55.760" style="s2">systems you actually see that in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.780" end="00:16:57.590" style="s2">politics one of the dangers of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.760" end="00:16:59.810" style="s2">growth of populism for example at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.590" end="00:17:02.990" style="s2">moment is it starts to pray create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.810" end="00:17:05.690" style="s2">level of constraint which perverts the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.990" end="00:17:07.220" style="s2">system yeah and so you effectively are</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.690" end="00:17:09.980" style="s2">micro complex to deal with an</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.220" end="00:17:12.190" style="s2">overarching political framework which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.980" end="00:17:14.590" style="s2">fairly easily managed so I think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.190" end="00:17:16.060" style="s2">a bit of both to be honest key things to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.590" end="00:17:17.830" style="s2">understand which type of system you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.060" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">in I love you for you to drill down a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.830" end="00:17:22.600" style="s2">little bit more into that example on</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:25.390" style="s2">populism and how it represents a pocket</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.600" end="00:17:27.250" style="s2">of complexity with one of the other main</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.390" end="00:17:29.830" style="s2">frameworks I invented which is called</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.250" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">apex predator theory it basically says</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.830" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">when when anything gets commoditized you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.090" end="00:17:38.230" style="s2">lose frequent variety in the system the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:41.110" style="s2">system becomes perverse and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.230" end="00:17:43.000" style="s2">something new can come into play so for</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.110" end="00:17:46.140" style="s2">example I&#39;ll give you an industry</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.000" end="00:17:48.550" style="s2">example in the political ones so IBM</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:50.410" style="s2">dominates the early history of computing</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.550" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">because it repurposes particle</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">technology that&#39;s called exaptation in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:17:56.830" style="s2">biology that gives it a first mover</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.340" end="00:17:58.780" style="s2">advantage it then doesn&#39;t see because it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.830" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">dominates the industry that hardware is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.780" end="00:18:03.130" style="s2">becoming a commodity and when it finally</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.560" style="s2">realizes is too late so it suffers</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.130" end="00:18:07.420" style="s2">almost catastrophic failure because all</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.560" end="00:18:09.940" style="s2">hardware is similarly priced it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.420" end="00:18:11.800" style="s2">pricing quality it&#39;s become a commodity</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.940" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">rather than the nadya VAT and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.800" end="00:18:15.550" style="s2">Microsoft takes over and that lasts for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">a period till software becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.550" end="00:18:20.680" style="s2">commodity well we seem politically is</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:22.420" style="s2">that neoliberalism effectively</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.680" end="00:18:25.870" style="s2">homogenized the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.420" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">politically and the a modernization and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.870" end="00:18:29.140" style="s2">the people didn&#39;t feel I had a choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:30.730" style="s2">anymore so the energy costs of</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.810" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">I would point out though that this</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:15.410" style="s2">also provides an opportunity for new</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.030" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">argue is forcing the human race on a</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:35.720" style="s2">have some bad things erupt</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.150" end="00:19:38.570" style="s2">you know neo-nazis anarchists and Tifa</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">remember I was heavily into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">operation theology in the 70s so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.290" style="s2">definitely opposed to neoliberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:53.690" style="s2">that probably know more about Just War</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.290" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">Theory from that period than most yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.690" end="00:19:57.890" style="s2">think the problem is that it&#39;s far easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.030" end="00:20:00.620" style="s2">for the populace right to control the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.890" end="00:20:02.510" style="s2">system particularly when you have social</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.510" end="00:20:06.530" style="s2">feedback loop so a friend of mine in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.280" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">matter because we knew the leaders were</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">but now the idiots have banded together</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">on the Internet to legitimize idiocy</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:19.910" style="s2">under that the president&#39;s the United</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">States that&#39;s my addition is original</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.910" end="00:20:24.140" style="s2">you know the danger is that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:25.820" style="s2">perverse feedback loop when you can see</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.140" end="00:20:27.740" style="s2">it in the manipulation of social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.820" end="00:20:30.830" style="s2">means that people have very little</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.740" end="00:20:33.800" style="s2">freedom so the right will nearly always</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.830" end="00:20:36.590" style="s2">win on commoditization if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.800" end="00:20:37.940" style="s2">history no we are not pessimistic on</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.590" end="00:20:39.740" style="s2">this if I look at some of the work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.940" end="00:20:41.150" style="s2">doing at the moment is for example to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.740" end="00:20:42.970" style="s2">make children there&#39;s dog refers to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.150" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">their own communities at a micro level</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.970" end="00:20:48.560" style="s2">so we introduce human agency which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">both horizontally mediated and bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.560" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">mediated into social media and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:55.670" style="s2">increase the chances of empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:57.920" style="s2">human interaction so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.670" end="00:20:59.870" style="s2">lot of things like that we can do but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.920" end="00:21:02.540" style="s2">won&#39;t be done by people gathering</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.870" end="00:21:04.370" style="s2">together on you know Hill sizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.540" end="00:21:06.620" style="s2">California and talking about how life</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.370" end="00:21:09.140" style="s2">would be better if only people left each</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.620" end="00:21:12.740" style="s2">other it&#39;s actually going to be done by</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:15.320" style="s2">me a low grade low level human</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.740" end="00:21:17.180" style="s2">interaction and systems which actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.320" end="00:21:19.820" style="s2">support that yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.180" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">absolutely right if there are new</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.820" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">theories on living people have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:24.390" style="s2">actually start applying them not just</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.100" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.390" end="00:21:28.530" style="s2">and certainly not just talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.100" end="00:21:30.030" style="s2">on social media it&#39;s actually the points</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.530" end="00:21:31.920" style="s2">on global we&#39;re about to launch should</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.030" end="00:21:34.590" style="s2">be website sometime that&#39;s week on</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.920" end="00:21:36.780" style="s2">looking at making global warming and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">micro issue because inter at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.780" end="00:21:40.590" style="s2">people are basically totally disabled by</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.690" style="s2">global warming it&#39;s just too big too</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.590" end="00:21:44.130" style="s2">problematic we did a big project for</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.690" end="00:21:46.680" style="s2">example on plastics this year at</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.130" end="00:21:48.780" style="s2">festivals that was one of a series of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.680" end="00:21:50.220" style="s2">projects we did to make people feel they</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.780" end="00:21:53.130" style="s2">could take control of their environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.220" end="00:21:55.050" style="s2">and make a difference and until people</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.130" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">feel they&#39;ve got controlled with a local</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.050" end="00:21:59.100" style="s2">level international initiatives won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:01.380" style="s2">work so I think what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.100" end="00:22:03.750" style="s2">is to use social media but critically</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.380" end="00:22:06.450" style="s2">with human mediation not algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.750" end="00:22:08.580" style="s2">mediation to actually change the nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.450" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">of human interaction at a micro</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.580" end="00:22:12.930" style="s2">community level and start to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:14.820" style="s2">the services of the grandiose schemes</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.930" end="00:22:16.560" style="s2">and grandiose ideas and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.820" end="00:22:18.540" style="s2">the solution to the growth of populism</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.560" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">but though sometimes the grandiose ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.540" end="00:22:22.620" style="s2">work right you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.460" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">I&#39;m following is the extinction</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.620" end="00:22:29.040" style="s2">rebellion over in the UK in fact I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">predicted slash suggested that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.040" end="00:22:34.890" style="s2">extinction rebellion folks adopt the</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.890" end="00:22:40.170" style="s2">of closing down airports right do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.280" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">on a worldwide basis and you&#39;d suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.170" end="00:22:43.800" style="s2">get people&#39;s attention in a major way</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:45.390" style="s2">yeah and I think but you see a myth I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.800" end="00:22:48.690" style="s2">mean we&#39;ve actually got a project going</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.390" end="00:22:50.340" style="s2">with those guys all right there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.690" end="00:22:52.110" style="s2">dealing with things at a local level</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.340" end="00:22:54.630" style="s2">still alright and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.110" end="00:22:56.670" style="s2">basically arising if they get too</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:22:58.260" style="s2">serious the state will start to move on</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.670" end="00:23:00.840" style="s2">the mean Hong Kong is really worrying at</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.260" end="00:23:02.460" style="s2">the moment and that the day the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.840" end="00:23:03.900" style="s2">moved the trip carries over the border</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.460" end="00:23:05.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all over on one of these days they</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.900" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">may well do that might be over for China</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.880" end="00:23:09.970" style="s2">though you know they should as we</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">both know in a complex system it is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.970" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">difficult to project very far out at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:17.860" style="s2">moment China strategy is to control</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:19.240" style="s2">natural resources and to give him when</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.240" end="00:23:22.510" style="s2">carefully it was I&#39;m working on some</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.470" end="00:23:25.870" style="s2">projects on this and there are directly</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.510" end="00:23:27.460" style="s2">is alright I think there are some if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.870" end="00:23:29.590" style="s2">actually get a history of humanity you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.460" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">have periods of tyrannical control</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.590" end="00:23:33.880" style="s2">before you get liberation the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.799" style="s2">the planet can&#39;t afford a period of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.880" end="00:23:37.240" style="s2">tyrannical control which ignores global</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.799" end="00:23:39.730" style="s2">warming we won&#39;t come out the other end</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.240" end="00:23:41.409" style="s2">this time and so I think we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.730" end="00:23:43.270" style="s2">think about a whole range of things the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.409" end="00:23:44.830" style="s2">extension rebellion is one that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.270" end="00:23:46.809" style="s2">got to actually create a lot more things</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.830" end="00:23:49.720" style="s2">as well okay let me jump back again I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.809" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">know because this is perhaps work my</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">just really try to get to engage you on</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.330" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2">it extraordinarily useful to think of I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.510" end="00:24:38.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the complicated complex</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:43.350" style="s2">language at the time but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.580" end="00:24:45.940" style="s2">entity like Thompson now Thomson Reuters</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.350" end="00:24:49.210" style="s2">operating in a sea of complexity which</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.940" end="00:24:51.580" style="s2">it had by no means great control but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:54.340" style="s2">did have the ability to start to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.580" end="00:24:57.340" style="s2">understand to some degree the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.340" end="00:25:00.280" style="s2">this complex regime and out-compete its</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.340" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">major peer competitors by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.280" end="00:25:04.780" style="s2">that it was living in a co-evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:07.750" style="s2">Fitness landscape rather than in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.780" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">static game which its competitors seemed</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.750" end="00:25:12.700" style="s2">to think it was doing and we use Fitness</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:14.140" style="s2">landscapes extensively but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.700" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">thing we develop too</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.140" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">I need is to get human metadata on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.230" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">raw data rather than just have</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.570" style="s2">algorithmic metadata so for example one</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:25.210" style="s2">of the projects we did in Pakistan we</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">pulled in 50,000 self interpreted micro</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">we were able to draw Fitness landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.590" end="00:25:33.310" style="s2">which shows underlying cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:35.800" style="s2">attitudes and beliefs we still do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.310" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">of that work yeah if we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.800" end="00:25:39.190" style="s2">merger these days for example we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.820" end="00:25:56.170" style="s2">interpret within the same hour and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:57.790" style="s2">draw a fitness landscapes which chose</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.680" style="s2">about the problem so I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:10.060" style="s2">Fitness landscapes have come on away we</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.680" end="00:26:13.180" style="s2">you know we almost there call them</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.060" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2">narrative landscapes yeah and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.180" end="00:26:16.810" style="s2">doing a huge amount of work to generate</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">those in larger and larger volumes with</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.410" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">element into the system run just relying</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:55.570" style="s2">agency in their own conditions very</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.680" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">interesting and that&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.570" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">relatively unique approach least I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:00.700" style="s2">familiar with other people doing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">anything like the scale that you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.700" end="00:27:06.130" style="s2">back later I&#39;m gonna drill down into</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:08.010" style="s2">your sense maker software and methods</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.130" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">where we&#39;ll get into that more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.010" end="00:27:13.510" style="s2">but before we go there what about other</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:15.190" style="s2">tools for exploring the complex realm</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.510" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">you know one that&#39;s popular in</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.190" end="00:27:18.550" style="s2">complexity science is you mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:20.370" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.550" end="00:27:23.170" style="s2">it sounded like with little disdain</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.370" end="00:27:25.270" style="s2">agent-based modeling and other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.170" end="00:27:26.950" style="s2">simulation with stochastic</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.270" end="00:27:28.780" style="s2">I think they&#39;re very useful provided</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:31.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve got single agency and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.780" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">rules the trouble is most human systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.210" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">are dealing with multiple identities and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.190" end="00:27:39.010" style="s2">patterns based on rule based decision so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:41.350" style="s2">I think simulation is powerful but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.010" end="00:27:43.180" style="s2">tend to get the confusion of simulation</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.350" end="00:27:45.310" style="s2">with prediction like their predecessors</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.180" end="00:27:47.740" style="s2">confuse correlation with causation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.310" end="00:27:49.780" style="s2">some of the AI people are now actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:27:52.180" style="s2">arguing that correlation is causation</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.780" end="00:27:55.780" style="s2">which is deeply worrying yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.180" end="00:27:57.910" style="s2">they&#39;re useful tools that Murray</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.780" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">gell-mann famously said and it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.910" end="00:28:01.690" style="s2">interesting I turned up at a European</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:03.550" style="s2">complexity conference and they said</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.690" end="00:28:06.520" style="s2">would I give a keynote on why you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.550" end="00:28:09.370" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use agent based model is in</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.520" end="00:28:10.810" style="s2">human systems yeah so I agreed to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.370" end="00:28:12.250" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t know everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.810" end="00:28:13.960" style="s2">audience just produced agent-based</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.250" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">modeling so it was a bit like Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.960" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">going into the Lions Den but I got</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">backed up by the other Kino to his</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:22.540" style="s2">merrie gilma and then he famously said</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:24.790" style="s2">that the only valid model of a human</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.540" end="00:28:26.440" style="s2">system is a system itself so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.790" end="00:28:28.420" style="s2">can use agent-based modeling to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.440" end="00:28:30.850" style="s2">understand aspects of a system and to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.420" end="00:28:32.590" style="s2">give you insight and clues but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.850" end="00:28:34.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t provide the sort of predictive</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.590" end="00:28:36.130" style="s2">element that people thank for it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.510" end="00:28:39.250" style="s2">it&#39;s quite interesting a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.130" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">simulations a very good historically but</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.250" end="00:28:43.150" style="s2">they&#39;ve been very problematic in terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">of foresight and I would strongly agree</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.150" end="00:28:46.180" style="s2">with you there and this was something</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:49.030" style="s2">when I talk to people about agent-based</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.180" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">modeling in social systems is that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.030" end="00:28:54.550" style="s2">should never take any given trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">of the system as an exemplar for</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.550" end="00:28:59.680" style="s2">prediction however one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:29:02.500" style="s2">that I do find very interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.680" end="00:29:05.230" style="s2">the statistics on the ensemble of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.500" end="00:29:06.790" style="s2">trajectories is very interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.230" end="00:29:10.840" style="s2">it tells you whether you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.790" end="00:29:11.620" style="s2">Gaussian space or a fat-tailed space you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.840" end="00:29:14.560" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.620" end="00:29:17.650" style="s2">Nassim Taleb would call extremists tan</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.560" end="00:29:20.860" style="s2">or mediocrity and and their agent based</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:22.690" style="s2">models can be very very powerful and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.860" end="00:29:26.020" style="s2">know it&#39;s clear that we have to manage</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.690" end="00:29:27.940" style="s2">in Gaussian distributed spaces very</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.020" end="00:29:30.460" style="s2">differently than we do in fat tail</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.940" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">spaces yeah and I think I mean I use a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.460" end="00:29:34.250" style="s2">Gaussian Pareto distinction in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:37.150" style="s2">what we call the trigger from</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.250" end="00:29:40.040" style="s2">dissipation anticipatory triggers yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.150" end="00:29:41.720" style="s2">so if you&#39;re in the pareto will the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.040" end="00:29:44.420" style="s2">you can do is trigger human beings to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.720" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">heightened state of alert yeah when they</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.420" end="00:29:47.030" style="s2">need to look at something and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.850" style="s2">what we did on counterterrorism for</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.030" end="00:29:51.980" style="s2">DARPA so you can&#39;t actually predict or</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.850" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">model a terrorist outrage but you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.980" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">use AI tragically human beings to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.950" end="00:29:58.730" style="s2">heightened state of alert when a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:30:00.290" style="s2">terrorist outrage is more likely and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.730" end="00:30:02.210" style="s2">we&#39;re currently moving that technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.290" end="00:30:05.030" style="s2">across intact to actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.210" end="00:30:07.220" style="s2">trigger when the plausibility of abuse</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.030" end="00:30:09.260" style="s2">in an elderly care home with time so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.220" end="00:30:11.810" style="s2">that&#39;s called switch to anticipatory</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.260" end="00:30:13.010" style="s2">triggers so I think the Prater gaseum I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.810" end="00:30:15.470" style="s2">spend a lot of time trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.010" end="00:30:16.310" style="s2">that to executives without help by talib</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.470" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">on this by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.310" end="00:30:20.300" style="s2">I think Talia does block more people</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:21.850" style="s2">with more nobel prizes and anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.300" end="00:30:24.740" style="s2">he calls me a idiot</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.090" end="00:30:38.030" style="s2">because I actually think the world needs</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.030" end="00:30:41.660" style="s2">collaborate and talk with each other and</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.800" end="00:30:48.950" style="s2">part of the problem not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.030" end="00:30:50.660" style="s2">solution I mean got people like DDA</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.950" end="00:30:53.510" style="s2">University of Zurich are actually much</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.660" end="00:30:55.340" style="s2">better in that field so talents got into</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.510" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">the producing a popular book every 18</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.340" end="00:30:58.790" style="s2">months Trek and there&#39;s too many people</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.790" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2">even worse actually and I do like some</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.210" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">brilliant I tell everyone read that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.310" end="00:31:13.220" style="s2">don&#39;t read the rest</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:16.220" style="s2">worse than become putting out a popular</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:43.130" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.090" end="00:31:44.900" style="s2">another item I&#39;d like to hop into on</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.130" end="00:31:47.390" style="s2">something that I saw in some of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.900" end="00:31:50.630" style="s2">writings is the chaotic regime I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.390" end="00:31:51.950" style="s2">you gave 9/11 as an example briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.630" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">ok good I think there were an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.950" end="00:31:56.750" style="s2">there because I would say it was very</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:59.480" style="s2">briefly a chaotic state we learned very</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.750" end="00:32:02.570" style="s2">very quickly for instance that we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.480" end="00:32:04.550" style="s2">not gonna have maybe we quickly learned</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.570" end="00:32:07.220" style="s2">that 10,000 terrorists had not missed</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.550" end="00:32:10.040" style="s2">our screen right that maybe there was 20</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.220" end="00:32:13.310" style="s2">or maybe there was a hundred and so this</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.040" end="00:32:15.170" style="s2">was not a existential risk to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.310" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">American Way of life despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.170" end="00:32:18.860" style="s2">that that narrative was sold politically</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.900" style="s2">which took us down a bunch of bad roads</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.860" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">and I think there was some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.900" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">mistakes made if you can trust 9/11 I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.000" end="00:32:26.660" style="s2">spend a lot of my time studying this</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">scene 13 time with Clinton&#39;s original</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:32.870" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like part the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:35.420" style="s2">that there was no need to turn all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.870" end="00:32:38.330" style="s2">aircraft that caused an economic</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.420" end="00:32:40.460" style="s2">disaster if you actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.330" end="00:32:42.050" style="s2">contrast with 7/7 because Britain has</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.460" end="00:32:43.490" style="s2">had the Blitz and multiple terrorist</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.050" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">bombings everybody went on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.490" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">Underground the next day to make a point</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:49.970" style="s2">yeah and that that&#39;s one of the ways I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.650" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve done a lot of work on this and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:53.570" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like another podcast to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.650" end="00:32:55.460" style="s2">about how your reversal is a lot by</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.570" end="00:32:57.190" style="s2">using your own population to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.460" end="00:32:59.660" style="s2">symmetric advantage against terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.190" end="00:33:01.640" style="s2">but coming back to the chaos points</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.660" end="00:33:03.170" style="s2">I mean chaos was temporarily there and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.640" end="00:33:05.780" style="s2">think chaos is always temporary and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.170" end="00:33:07.850" style="s2">that&#39;s where people get it wrong so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.780" end="00:33:10.370" style="s2">the state of the absence of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.850" end="00:33:12.470" style="s2">now ironically in physics that&#39;s a low</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.370" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">energy gradient in human systems it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:17.210" style="s2">high energy gradient because human</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:19.970" style="s2">systems are open so constraints happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.210" end="00:33:21.770" style="s2">very quickly and very naturally so some</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.970" end="00:33:23.060" style="s2">of the stuff we do onto stupid industry</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.770" end="00:33:25.430" style="s2">and support for example is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.060" end="00:33:27.890" style="s2">deliberately remove constraints but that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.430" end="00:33:29.090" style="s2">takes a lot of energy to do it so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.890" end="00:33:31.190" style="s2">we can actually get the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.090" end="00:33:32.900" style="s2">statistical framework framing that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.190" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">can get with Fitness landscapes for</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.900" end="00:33:37.790" style="s2">example yeah so chaos is temporary it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:39.140" style="s2">not permanent you don&#39;t want to fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.790" end="00:33:40.820" style="s2">into it you want to enter it</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.140" end="00:33:42.500" style="s2">deliberately most of the time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.820" end="00:33:43.970" style="s2">dealing with gradations of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.500" end="00:33:45.050" style="s2">now do you have some guidance so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.970" end="00:33:47.750" style="s2">take go back to the night I&#39;ll have an</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.050" end="00:33:50.270" style="s2">example and there&#39;ll be other examples</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:52.670" style="s2">I suspect for instance that the next big</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.270" end="00:33:54.560" style="s2">financial reverse will be bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.670" end="00:33:56.150" style="s2">2008 what&#39;s gonna is going to look</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.560" end="00:33:59.300" style="s2">chaotic for a while</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.150" end="00:34:03.140" style="s2">do you have any guidance for executives</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.300" end="00:34:05.750" style="s2">business decision-makers etc for how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.140" end="00:34:08.060" style="s2">deal with a truly deeply chaotic system</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.750" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">great constraints I mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.060" end="00:34:11.659" style="s2">what we build in distributed decision</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.340" style="s2">support systems we just run one on</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.659" end="00:34:15.770" style="s2">career which I can&#39;t talk about too much</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.340" end="00:34:17.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s where you present an</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.770" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">ambiguous assessment of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.480" end="00:34:21.590" style="s2">literally to five or six thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">who interpret it and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.590" end="00:34:25.940" style="s2">Fitness landscapes within seconds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">you look at dominant patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.940" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">minority patterns so you can find new</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:32.030" style="s2">ways of creating constraint for new</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.570" end="00:34:34.070" style="s2">forms of exit but that requires</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">companies to build those systems before</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.070" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">the crisis comes and I say you build</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.870" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">with something like 911 well first of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.940" end="00:34:53.419" style="s2">all they could have actually not played</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">politics I mean there was actually a</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:15.140" style="s2">algorithm this strikes me is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">lesson on how to think about you know a</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.140" end="00:36:21.050" style="s2">chaotic regime it does we use multiple</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:23.510" style="s2">human agents as well as algorithms and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.050" end="00:36:25.670" style="s2">that&#39;s key humans and abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.510" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">computers find that very difficult I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.670" end="00:36:29.870" style="s2">mean art comes before language in human</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:31.670" style="s2">evolution and we think the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.870" end="00:36:34.580" style="s2">function of art was to allow us to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">novel or unexpected connections but also</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.580" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">to assess their relative possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:41.540" style="s2">yeah so human beings are actually good</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:44.060" style="s2">in chaos we&#39;ve all for it but you have</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.650" end="00:36:50.090" style="s2">decision making yeah very good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.840" end="00:36:52.940" style="s2">very true and still a human superpower</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.090" end="00:36:54.860" style="s2">was a very large gap between what a eyes</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.940" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">can do and what humans can do I actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.860" end="00:36:59.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s a permanent and less and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.320" end="00:37:00.890" style="s2">I did a big lecture on this recently I</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.030" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">said the problem is that in Singapore</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.890" end="00:37:04.760" style="s2">the problem at the moment is they may</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:06.110" style="s2">exceed US intelligence because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.760" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">currently working on meeting them</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.110" end="00:37:10.850" style="s2">halfway we&#39;re reducing human</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.850" end="00:37:14.600" style="s2">structured approaches and you know AI</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.890" end="00:37:17.750" style="s2">will always be better other than humans</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.600" end="00:37:21.290" style="s2">and may no I do a fair amount of work in</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.750" end="00:37:23.060" style="s2">the AI space and I do think it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.290" end="00:37:26.360" style="s2">likely they&#39;re not certain that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.060" end="00:37:27.980" style="s2">eventually within 50 years they will</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.360" end="00:37:31.610" style="s2">have artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.980" end="00:37:33.650" style="s2">ha&#39;s which will have those same broad</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.610" end="00:37:35.090" style="s2">integrative capabilities of humans do</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.650" end="00:37:37.310" style="s2">and then that&#39;s when things get very</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.090" end="00:37:39.620" style="s2">interesting yeah and unless you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.310" end="00:37:41.390" style="s2">build in you got to build in sense and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.620" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">you go to build an abstraction and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.390" end="00:37:45.110" style="s2">don&#39;t see any sign of that to them not</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.400" end="00:37:47.630" style="s2">in the deep learning world this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.110" end="00:37:51.190" style="s2">something that I come back to again and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.630" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">again in my talks is that much of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.190" end="00:37:55.990" style="s2">the public has now been convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">artificial intelligence basically equals</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.990" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">deep learning and deep learning is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:03.310" style="s2">rather just one school of AI currently</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:05.650" style="s2">the dominant one but there are others</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.310" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">you know symbolic AI still exists for</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.650" end="00:38:11.369" style="s2">instance guys like Gary Marcus it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:14.920" style="s2">been Gertz all Josh Tenenbaum at MIT</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.369" end="00:38:18.220" style="s2">there are many people still working on</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.920" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">much more abstract intractable and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:22.900" style="s2">transparent approaches they are and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:24.940" style="s2">believe they win the end or likely to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.900" end="00:38:27.369" style="s2">further than the deep learning guys I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.940" end="00:38:29.410" style="s2">think that go further I think Keon is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.369" end="00:38:31.420" style="s2">some of our work at moment is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.410" end="00:38:33.700" style="s2">building is actually focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.420" end="00:38:35.290" style="s2">building the training data sense which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:37.030" style="s2">know is the type of deep learning but</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.290" end="00:38:39.130" style="s2">it&#39;s also things from the symbolic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.030" end="00:38:41.349" style="s2">I think people don&#39;t pay enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.130" end="00:38:43.270" style="s2">attention to that yeah or they work with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.349" end="00:38:46.089" style="s2">limited sets but I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.270" end="00:38:48.040" style="s2">developing field the silicon ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.089" end="00:38:50.710" style="s2">zinc-carbon when it comes down to it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.040" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">yeah the other thing of course that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.710" end="00:38:57.210" style="s2">own actual experimental work is on is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:39:00.940" style="s2">that humans learn way faster than</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.210" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">computers do today right a you know to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.940" end="00:39:05.710" style="s2">learn to play go well took you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:07.540" style="s2">hundreds of billions of games played</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.710" end="00:39:09.460" style="s2">you know the very top chess players</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:11.740" style="s2">probably only played thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.460" end="00:39:13.660" style="s2">games in his whole life you can wipe out</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.660" end="00:39:16.839" style="s2">the room it would take some going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.430" end="00:39:18.970" style="s2">accommodate where as a human being would</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.839" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">accommodate instantly you can change the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.970" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">size of the board right the classically</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:25.450" style="s2">humans play go on different sized boards</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.550" style="s2">but alphago would had to be trained on</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.450" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">one specific sized board and if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.550" end="00:39:33.730" style="s2">change the board size even by one at its</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.060" end="00:39:35.650" style="s2">capabilities felt way up me I think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.730" end="00:39:37.750" style="s2">comes back to the fact commands around</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.650" end="00:39:40.150" style="s2">the local digital it comes back so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.750" end="00:39:41.650" style="s2">I mean too few people miss there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.150" end="00:39:43.560" style="s2">things that people need at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.650" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">one is they should be trained in ethics</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.560" end="00:39:47.410" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t be allowing anybody to be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.180" style="s2">software engineer these days without</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.410" end="00:39:50.859" style="s2">basic training and ethics from quite a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.180" end="00:39:53.470" style="s2">young age because they&#39;re scary</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.859" end="00:39:54.210" style="s2">the other one is aesthetics if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.470" end="00:39:56.280" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.210" end="00:39:58.080" style="s2">the sentence in human evolution you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.280" end="00:40:00.089" style="s2">never gonna get an AI a system which</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.080" end="00:40:02.339" style="s2">really helps to much aesthetics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.089" end="00:40:04.020" style="s2">interesting I have never heard that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.339" end="00:40:06.060" style="s2">ethics of course lots of this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.020" end="00:40:08.730" style="s2">about how that should become mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.060" end="00:40:10.170" style="s2">more deeply baked in I&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.730" end="00:40:12.210" style="s2">you say more about why you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.170" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">aesthetics is important because its</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.210" end="00:40:17.490" style="s2">essence is about abstractions so yes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:19.109" style="s2">music cannot come before language in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.490" end="00:40:20.970" style="s2">human evolution so human language</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.109" end="00:40:22.650" style="s2">evolves from abstractions and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.970" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2">evolutionary argument for this is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.650" end="00:40:28.859" style="s2">allows rapid ex active thinking so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.140" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">ability to rapidly repurpose things is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.859" end="00:40:33.180" style="s2">actually comes from abstraction so and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s also a matter of you get higher</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.180" end="00:40:37.650" style="s2">empathy in abstraction than you doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:39.720" style="s2">the material things like parable form</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.650" end="00:40:42.089" style="s2">stories for example provide better moral</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.720" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">guidance and values or principles and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.089" end="00:40:47.339" style="s2">partly because they define a negative</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:49.349" style="s2">not the positive so an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.339" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">understand or appreciate beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.349" end="00:40:53.460" style="s2">actually going to make you a much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:55.890" style="s2">effective decision maker as a human and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.460" end="00:40:59.010" style="s2">then if you just confine yourself to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.890" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">material now wonderful FedEx is a subset</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.010" end="00:41:05.339" style="s2">of a broader category of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:08.490" style="s2">metaphor you know as we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.339" end="00:41:10.680" style="s2">work of Lake off and others our language</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.490" end="00:41:14.520" style="s2">and our thinking is way more</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.680" end="00:41:16.950" style="s2">metaphorical than we often realize it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.520" end="00:41:19.080" style="s2">and Deakins simple its species finally</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.950" end="00:41:21.690" style="s2">kill jumps give you use of language off</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.080" end="00:41:24.660" style="s2">thank God one of my favorite books I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.690" end="00:41:26.430" style="s2">love that Deacon&#39;s symbolic species not</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.660" end="00:41:28.830" style="s2">as well appreciated as it should be</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.430" end="00:41:30.359" style="s2">people go out and read that book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.830" end="00:41:32.130" style="s2">about the subsequent books where he</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.359" end="00:41:34.260" style="s2">partly plagiarized other people&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.130" end="00:41:36.510" style="s2">for it but symbolic species is brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.260" end="00:41:40.500" style="s2">yeah the second but the book after was</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.510" end="00:41:43.500" style="s2">unfortunately just not to my taste at</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.500" end="00:41:44.970" style="s2">all you can read opt really into other</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.500" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">books I can give you the references</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.970" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">Herman I&#39;m not gonna bother I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:51.780" style="s2">even like it in the for in that form</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:53.700" style="s2">Tiger the truth okay but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.780" end="00:41:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the important one if you and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.700" end="00:41:57.869" style="s2">know the other good idea that the modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.470" end="00:41:59.730" style="s2">finds epigenetics and the way we</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.869" end="00:42:01.349" style="s2">describe we now know that the Cain is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.730" end="00:42:03.780" style="s2">Miz right so we know the mechanism for</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.670" end="00:42:10.710" style="s2">and all of that we need people designing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.790" end="00:42:12.690" style="s2">tools for there&#39;s a thing in the</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">hypothesis in general because I my</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.060" style="s2">realist variety so I think we probably</p>

<p begin="00:44:51.060" end="00:44:56.730" style="s2">hand I also look at low low low</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.350" end="00:44:58.680" style="s2">probabilities and can&#39;t quite roll it</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.960" end="00:45:09.240" style="s2">that&#39;s total and pernicious horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.930" end="00:45:11.310" style="s2">and as you say leads people to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.240" end="00:45:13.050" style="s2">about some very bad things we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.310" end="00:45:14.340" style="s2">about some very esoteric things here</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.050" end="00:45:16.110" style="s2">this has been a very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.340" end="00:45:17.550" style="s2">rich discussion I&#39;d like to turn it a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.110" end="00:45:20.340" style="s2">little bit back towards the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.550" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">hands-on and practical some of our</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">entrepreneurs what could you say about</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.070" end="00:45:31.590" style="s2">some takeaways for people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:33.990" style="s2">management positions about different</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.590" end="00:45:36.210" style="s2">management styles and ways of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.990" end="00:45:38.490" style="s2">with their organization that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.210" end="00:45:41.400" style="s2">Kineton oriented approach might suggest</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.490" end="00:45:43.890" style="s2">okay two things one is the value of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.400" end="00:45:46.350" style="s2">Kevin is it basically says there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.890" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">one start of the edition so seven</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.350" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">leadership doesn&#39;t work universally</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">draconian leadership works in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:55.560" style="s2">contexts so you need to be multifaceted</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:57.810" style="s2">in the way that you lead and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.560" end="00:45:59.810" style="s2">distribute the leadership the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.810" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">thing is in attitudes matter more</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.810" end="00:46:04.170" style="s2">because attitudes early indicators so</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll give the example of stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.170" end="00:46:08.520" style="s2">currently working on cybersecurity where</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">we&#39;re measuring attitudes to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.520" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">cybersecurity not compliance and we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:15.060" style="s2">that by effectively presented an</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.060" end="00:46:20.229" style="s2">breach we get everybody in the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.319" end="00:46:22.599" style="s2">to interpret it in real-time including</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.229" end="00:46:24.089" style="s2">their own situational assessment and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.599" end="00:46:26.349" style="s2">their own micro story about the future</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.089" end="00:46:28.599" style="s2">and from that we draw a fitness</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.349" end="00:46:31.719" style="s2">landscape which identifies the attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.599" end="00:46:33.640" style="s2">of your employees to cybersecurity and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.719" end="00:46:35.229" style="s2">allow you to notice the system has</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.640" end="00:46:37.109" style="s2">called more stories like this fewer</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.229" end="00:46:39.190" style="s2">stories like that in real time so</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.109" end="00:46:41.109" style="s2">recognizing and the whole point about</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.190" end="00:46:43.180" style="s2">can having is different styles work in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.109" end="00:46:46.539" style="s2">different domains and recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.180" end="00:46:49.469" style="s2">attitudes whether it&#39;s the security to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.539" end="00:46:52.239" style="s2">ethics to customer purchasing behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.469" end="00:46:54.489" style="s2">yeah virtually anything is more</p>

<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:06.910" style="s2">outcome so basically I expand the search</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.819" end="00:47:09.039" style="s2">space first yeah it&#39;s interesting I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.910" end="00:47:11.019" style="s2">there&#39;s forecasting and bad casting so</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.039" end="00:47:13.029" style="s2">forecasting predicts projects forward</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.019" end="00:47:15.640" style="s2">back casting says what would we like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.029" end="00:47:17.319" style="s2">get and close the gaps what we do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.640" end="00:47:19.329" style="s2">call site casting which gives me</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.319" end="00:47:21.789" style="s2">wonderful visual metaphors with trout</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.329" end="00:47:23.859" style="s2">fishermen yeah you can around in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:35.890" style="s2">is that you certainly encourage dissent</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.309" end="00:47:38.199" style="s2">and diversity which I strongly agree</p>

<p begin="00:48:16.719" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">so you have to have you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.670" end="00:48:22.239" style="s2">differences which can come together in</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">different ways so for example on Welsh</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.239" end="00:48:26.500" style="s2">if you meet anybody from Wales the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:28.030" style="s2">thing I asked it was where you come from</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.500" end="00:48:29.470" style="s2">because we have to establish somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.030" end="00:48:31.000" style="s2">which we can have a fight with you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.470" end="00:48:33.070" style="s2">we&#39;ll get it down to a valley eventually</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.000" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s asbestos incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.070" end="00:48:37.180" style="s2">who cheated wrote B with the referees</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">they bribe for him I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.180" end="00:48:41.470" style="s2">Cardiff but when the English come were</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:43.210" style="s2">Welsh of course right now that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.470" end="00:48:45.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the example of coherent helps</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.210" end="00:48:47.020" style="s2">regionality know what we can do with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.010" end="00:48:49.510" style="s2">attitude mapping I mentioned earlier is</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.020" end="00:48:51.670" style="s2">we can measure the level of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.510" end="00:48:54.520" style="s2">and behavioral Dover&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.670" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">organization and we can identify outlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.520" end="00:48:57.850" style="s2">groups who you should pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.230" end="00:48:59.710" style="s2">rather than getting drowned out by</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.850" end="00:49:01.270" style="s2">middle management and that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.710" end="00:49:03.310" style="s2">thing that comes out to the attitudinal</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.270" end="00:49:05.830" style="s2">mapping yeah you have to maintain though</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.310" end="00:49:07.540" style="s2">versity in the system but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.830" end="00:49:09.940" style="s2">maintain though the city which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.540" end="00:49:12.340" style="s2">freakish I survived an IBM by top cover</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.940" end="00:49:14.650" style="s2">when my top cover went it was all over</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.340" end="00:49:16.780" style="s2">you actually need to get around those</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.650" end="00:49:19.300" style="s2">four the problems by providing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.780" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">interactions between dissonant groups</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.300" end="00:49:24.250" style="s2">and yet there still has to be some way</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">to sort out you know what is useful</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.250" end="00:49:28.300" style="s2">diversity and what is just crank or your</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:30.700" style="s2">cupboard nest</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.300" end="00:49:32.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what we deal with with with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.700" end="00:49:35.260" style="s2">conflict space so I present a situation</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.380" end="00:49:37.870" style="s2">I&#39;ll get everybody in the workforce to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.260" end="00:49:39.310" style="s2">interpret it I&#39;ll then get dominant</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.870" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">views but I&#39;ll get fifteen or sixteen</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.310" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">clusters about live views</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:45.820" style="s2">I let the clusters run a small safe to</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:48.280" style="s2">fail experiment and we see what works</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.820" end="00:49:50.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the key concert resolution to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.280" end="00:49:52.180" style="s2">us so I have in fact we I do what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.680" end="00:49:55.150" style="s2">called a shallow dive into chaos I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.180" end="00:49:56.830" style="s2">moving to an unconstrained system to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.150" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">actually statistically map onto a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.830" end="00:50:01.420" style="s2">landscape and I know which ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.710" style="s2">coherent enough to explore even though</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.420" end="00:50:05.380" style="s2">they&#39;re different which are actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.710" end="00:50:06.970" style="s2">nonsense and the test for coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.380" end="00:50:09.070" style="s2">something we do a lot of and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.970" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">key concept in philosophy of science so</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.070" end="00:50:12.850" style="s2">going back to an earlier point of view</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:13.270" style="s2">we know that most evolutionary theory is</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.850" end="00:50:14.560" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.270" end="00:50:17.710" style="s2">because we keep discovering new things</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.560" end="00:50:20.050" style="s2">but it is coherent to the facts whereas</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.710" end="00:50:21.400" style="s2">young Earth Creationism is incoherent to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.050" end="00:50:24.370" style="s2">the facts so it&#39;s not worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.400" end="00:50:26.230" style="s2">exploring so a lot of our work has been</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.370" end="00:50:28.300" style="s2">to produce objective quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.230" end="00:50:30.460" style="s2">measures of coherence within an</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.300" end="00:50:32.140" style="s2">organization so you know which</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.460" end="00:50:32.510" style="s2">dissidents are worth talking to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.140" end="00:50:33.890" style="s2">which I</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.510" end="00:50:35.810" style="s2">so that&#39;s how a relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.890" end="00:50:39.020" style="s2">process I would love to hear more about</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.810" end="00:50:41.870" style="s2">that in thinking about operating systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.020" end="00:50:43.310" style="s2">of the future with some collaborators in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.870" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">mind some have been on our podcast</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.310" end="00:50:48.620" style="s2">recently coherence is a key concept I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:52.070" style="s2">love to hear what you can tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.620" end="00:50:54.950" style="s2">how to measure coherence okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.070" end="00:50:56.210" style="s2">take my example of a policy situation so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.950" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking have taken over a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.210" end="00:50:59.630" style="s2">company you&#39;re moving into a new area so</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.120" style="s2">you put that together as an infographic</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.630" end="00:51:04.370" style="s2">like a facebook news page where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.120" end="00:51:05.450" style="s2">got dissenting views common views you</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.370" end="00:51:07.670" style="s2">know the sort of thing people are used</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.450" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">to simulating you present that to your</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.670" end="00:51:11.930" style="s2">whole workforce in one hour without the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:14.570" style="s2">chance for collusion ask them to write a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.930" end="00:51:16.580" style="s2">micro situational assessment then we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.570" end="00:51:18.830" style="s2">the human metadata which is non-game</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.580" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">herbal human interpretation which gives</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.830" end="00:51:22.940" style="s2">us quant data from which we can draw</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.390" end="00:51:25.010" style="s2">Fitness landscapes and we finish off</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.940" end="00:51:27.830" style="s2">with a micro scenario how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.010" end="00:51:29.510" style="s2">this will develop that means the minute</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.830" end="00:51:31.370" style="s2">the hour is over we can present the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.510" end="00:51:34.190" style="s2">executive with a fitness landscape which</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.370" end="00:51:36.680" style="s2">shows clusters of effectively coherent</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.190" end="00:51:38.090" style="s2">ideas and then we can go to those and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.680" end="00:51:39.980" style="s2">give them some cash to do a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.090" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">experiment so that&#39;s a few relatively</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.980" end="00:51:45.700" style="s2">simple so you can essentially do a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:48.650" style="s2">statistical analysis on the cluster</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.700" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">statistics of the narratives and if</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.650" end="00:51:52.700" style="s2">there isn&#39;t much clustering then you</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:55.100" style="s2">could say your coherence is low if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.700" end="00:51:56.540" style="s2">tightly clutched around a single or</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.100" end="00:51:58.970" style="s2">small number of points you can say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.540" end="00:52:00.860" style="s2">highly coherent may be overly coherent</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.970" end="00:52:03.590" style="s2">it&#39;s also very dangerous be sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.860" end="00:52:06.290" style="s2">going this diversity so we got metrics</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.590" end="00:52:08.060" style="s2">on this yeah you want there&#39;s a level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.290" end="00:52:09.590" style="s2">dissent you want to have permanently</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.060" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">present within the organization and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.590" end="00:52:13.490" style="s2">think Buster and I did before he died</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">was to measure the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.490" end="00:52:17.420" style="s2">inefficiency a system needed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:20.060" style="s2">be effective and do you have anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.420" end="00:52:21.530" style="s2">you can throw explicate on and how one</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.060" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">would think about what&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.530" end="00:52:25.640" style="s2">amount of diversity suppose it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:27.350" style="s2">situationally dependent that links him</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.640" end="00:52:29.420" style="s2">with apex predators so if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.350" end="00:52:31.190" style="s2">stable ecosystem you don&#39;t need so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.420" end="00:52:33.020" style="s2">diversity if the system is telling to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.190" end="00:52:34.970" style="s2">destabilize you need to introduce that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.020" end="00:52:37.550" style="s2">increased diversity very quickly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.970" end="00:52:39.800" style="s2">in an evolutionary computation which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.550" end="00:52:42.290" style="s2">my home academic field that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.800" end="00:52:43.790" style="s2">call the difference between exploitation</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.290" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">and exploration</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.790" end="00:52:48.440" style="s2">in stable times you want to do more</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">exploitation in unstable times you must</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.440" end="00:52:52.370" style="s2">do more exploration and then the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.080" style="s2">secondary work we did which was</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.370" end="00:52:55.820" style="s2">originally the counterterrorism work is</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.080" end="00:52:58.220" style="s2">when to you and this is where we produce</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.820" end="00:53:01.340" style="s2">human mediated training datasets because</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.220" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">we need executive buy-in is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.340" end="00:53:04.790" style="s2">use our to trigger when you need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:06.410" style="s2">switch between the two is by the time</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.790" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">you see it normally it will be too late</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.410" end="00:53:10.490" style="s2">because I use a is to determine that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">could you say more about that what we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.490" end="00:53:14.300" style="s2">is we build training data sets based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:16.670" style="s2">for example multiple counter-terrorist</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.300" end="00:53:18.590" style="s2">examples in the past using fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.670" end="00:53:21.350" style="s2">observations which are available before</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.590" end="00:53:22.970" style="s2">her and we use those to produce similar</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.350" end="00:53:25.310" style="s2">things and now happenin you need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.970" end="00:53:27.350" style="s2">attention but because the executives</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.310" end="00:53:29.030" style="s2">have been involved in the construction</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.350" end="00:53:31.430" style="s2">the training data sets they actually</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.840" end="00:53:59.300" style="s2">AI right it&#39;s not necessarily a black</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.290" end="00:54:00.860" style="s2">box the ability to look at whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.300" end="00:54:02.740" style="s2">level of detail you want on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.860" end="00:54:05.300" style="s2">reasoning or even have it generate</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.740" end="00:54:07.070" style="s2">scripts that explain its reasoning our</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.300" end="00:54:09.260" style="s2">feasible well that&#39;s not feasible at</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.070" end="00:54:11.900" style="s2">least not yet with respect to neural AI</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.260" end="00:54:13.850" style="s2">yeah I think I think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.900" end="00:54:15.320" style="s2">anticipate three triggers I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.850" end="00:54:16.790" style="s2">had these debates and I have them in</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.320" end="00:54:19.580" style="s2">Boston not so long I was learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.790" end="00:54:21.650" style="s2">Cambridge not so long ago as I still</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.580" end="00:54:23.600" style="s2">think we&#39;re not the the AI industry is</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.650" end="00:54:26.210" style="s2">is trying to remove is trying to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.600" end="00:54:27.890" style="s2">from the increased human agency we think</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.210" end="00:54:29.990" style="s2">the really filter thing is to increase</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.890" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">human agency then the AI will get better</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.990" end="00:54:33.620" style="s2">could you give an example of that well</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.850" end="00:54:35.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of for example what</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.620" end="00:54:36.590" style="s2">I&#39;m just giving you example but we use</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.000" end="00:54:38.690" style="s2">our workforce to assess the situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.590" end="00:54:41.630" style="s2">that creates training data sets that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.690" end="00:54:44.420" style="s2">can then check enjoy I systems yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.630" end="00:54:47.030" style="s2">that&#39;s one way the other is traceability</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.420" end="00:54:48.770" style="s2">yeah several things like that okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.030" end="00:54:50.660" style="s2">gonna hop to another concept that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.770" end="00:54:52.520" style="s2">believe I took out of your writings</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.660" end="00:54:54.950" style="s2">which is it in an unordered system</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.520" end="00:54:56.599" style="s2">causality cannot be determined</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.950" end="00:54:58.279" style="s2">I&#39;d like to point out there is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.599" end="00:55:01.250" style="s2">interesting and somewhat slippery</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.279" end="00:55:03.349" style="s2">concept of downward causality in complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.250" end="00:55:06.440" style="s2">systems bring it down to a tangible</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.349" end="00:55:08.420" style="s2">example the chemicals in the cells of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.440" end="00:55:10.700" style="s2">body are highly constrained by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.420" end="00:55:13.279" style="s2">that they are evolved to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.700" end="00:55:15.609" style="s2">tightly coupled package of chemical</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.279" end="00:55:17.779" style="s2">homeostasis which has to exist on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.609" end="00:55:20.059" style="s2">second-by-second bankís and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.779" end="00:55:22.819" style="s2">tremendously constrains the degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.059" end="00:55:24.410" style="s2">freedom of those chemicals so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.819" end="00:55:27.380" style="s2">to me that if one thinks about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.410" end="00:55:30.769" style="s2">concept of downward causality there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.380" end="00:55:33.500" style="s2">very large amount of constraint that one</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.769" end="00:55:36.289" style="s2">couldn&#39;t basically extract about any</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.500" end="00:55:38.150" style="s2">given entity within the complex system</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.289" end="00:55:39.740" style="s2">that was the problem making nearly a my</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.150" end="00:55:41.450" style="s2">point about populous and the danger</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.740" end="00:55:43.069" style="s2">about pocket is amiss increases it</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.450" end="00:55:44.750" style="s2">downwards constraints and reduces</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.069" end="00:55:47.900" style="s2">freedom of action until it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.750" end="00:55:49.460" style="s2">catastrophic so that that means in fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.900" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">if the system has become ordered not</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.460" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">complex because the constraint level is</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:55.099" style="s2">so high and this also the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:55:56.750" style="s2">granularity you can&#39;t go from a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.099" end="00:55:58.940" style="s2">reaction to a human system because a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.750" end="00:56:01.250" style="s2">human system is is an order of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.940" end="00:56:04.269" style="s2">greater of several dozen magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.250" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">greater in terms of uncertainty linkages</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.269" end="00:56:09.079" style="s2">constraints and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:12.769" style="s2">yes related multiple levels of emergence</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.079" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">between chemicals and human body but</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.769" end="00:56:17.240" style="s2">nonetheless the behavior of those</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:20.839" style="s2">chemicals is very highly constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.240" end="00:56:23.210" style="s2">being part of this real time chemical</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.839" end="00:56:25.430" style="s2">homeostasis which is used to support the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.210" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">entity itself and the result is actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.430" end="00:56:29.480" style="s2">quite powerful I mean the chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">restrict the way we can make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.480" end="00:56:33.680" style="s2">in the brain individually but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">take an aggregate approach to this but</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.680" end="00:56:38.509" style="s2">it&#39;s how you reach a human system you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:40.220" style="s2">got so many micro constraints yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.509" end="00:56:42.740" style="s2">macro enabling constraints that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.220" end="00:56:45.319" style="s2">system is actually as much higher level</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.740" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">of in predictability than the low level</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.319" end="00:56:51.190" style="s2">stuff yep that&#39;s good I like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:55.099" style="s2">next topic you&#39;ve suggested multi</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.190" end="00:56:56.849" style="s2">hypotheses I didn&#39;t see any reference to</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.099" end="00:56:58.979" style="s2">the limited amount of data</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.849" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">I read about red team&#39;s episode my</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.979" end="00:57:04.710" style="s2">favorite management techniques</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:07.589" style="s2">does that fit into your methods at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.710" end="00:57:09.299" style="s2">yeah a sembly way we did in Singapore is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.589" end="00:57:11.279" style="s2">to create an alternative to red teams by</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.299" end="00:57:14.220" style="s2">the problem with red the red teams are</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.279" end="00:57:15.479" style="s2">truly independent they work yeah if they</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.220" end="00:57:18.539" style="s2">came from the same cultural background</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.479" end="00:57:20.339" style="s2">it can be problematic so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.539" end="00:57:22.499" style="s2">technique called ritual descent in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.339" end="00:57:24.450" style="s2">we&#39;ll fragment into multiple small micro</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.499" end="00:57:26.039" style="s2">red teams looking at decision-making but</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.450" end="00:57:28.589" style="s2">overall being red teams had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.039" end="00:57:30.690" style="s2">value you can&#39;t do it say just with an</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.589" end="00:57:32.430" style="s2">s2 challenge in military terms because</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.690" end="00:57:33.989" style="s2">that&#39;s who&#39;s being fasted construction</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.430" end="00:57:35.519" style="s2">that plan you have always thought there</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.989" end="00:57:37.710" style="s2">ought to be a consulting firm that all</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.519" end="00:57:39.960" style="s2">they do is do red teams for companies</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.710" end="00:57:42.180" style="s2">but such a thing exists there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.960" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">few we work with a couple and I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.180" end="00:57:46.920" style="s2">a project this week where we I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.940" end="00:57:48.809" style="s2">who width right that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.920" end="00:57:52.049" style="s2">going to affect to the red team a</p>

<p begin="00:57:52.049" end="00:57:56.009" style="s2">multiple ways to destroy it the way it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.910" end="00:57:57.809" style="s2">can be perverted in practice I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.009" end="00:58:00.329" style="s2">really enjoy doing that you know once I</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.809" end="00:58:01.950" style="s2">conceptualize the concept of a red team</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.329" end="00:58:03.479" style="s2">consulting for our my said damn I wish</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.950" end="00:58:05.339" style="s2">I&#39;d taken that road in life that might</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.479" end="00:58:06.690" style="s2">have been a shitload of fun the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.339" end="00:58:08.789" style="s2">thing is I mean what we&#39;re doing there</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.690" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">is I&#39;m working with native experts so if</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.789" end="00:58:12.839" style="s2">you understand the way narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:15.239" style="s2">constructed it&#39;s fairly easy to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.839" end="00:58:16.440" style="s2">introduce retroviruses into narrative by</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.239" end="00:58:18.599" style="s2">which people&#39;s stories destroy</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.440" end="00:58:21.089" style="s2">themselves yeah that gives me to my next</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.599" end="00:58:23.219" style="s2">topic actually narrative narrative</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.089" end="00:58:26.249" style="s2">appears to be central to at least your</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.219" end="00:58:29.279" style="s2">later work right could you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.249" end="00:58:32.999" style="s2">what you mean by narrative and what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.279" end="00:58:35.130" style="s2">its position in your work Palani said we</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.999" end="00:58:36.900" style="s2">always know more than we can say and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.130" end="00:58:38.819" style="s2">extended that said we can always say</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.900" end="00:58:41.309" style="s2">more than we can write them so if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.819" end="00:58:42.989" style="s2">look at narrative in humans right if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.309" end="00:58:43.769" style="s2">if you want to look at what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.989" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.769" end="00:58:47.069" style="s2">what you want is the watercooler stories</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:48.390" style="s2">the stories of the school gate the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.069" end="00:58:50.910" style="s2">stories of the checkout queue in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.390" end="00:58:53.249" style="s2">supermarket because those actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.910" end="00:58:54.779" style="s2">determine people&#39;s attitudes rather than</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.249" end="00:58:57.029" style="s2">responses in focus groups to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.779" end="00:58:59.549" style="s2">questionnaires or imposing yeah where</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.029" end="00:59:02.279" style="s2">you&#39;re asking explicit questions so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.549" end="00:59:04.200" style="s2">work we do is to actually gather those</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.279" end="00:59:06.540" style="s2">day-to-day micro narratives but</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.200" end="00:59:08.970" style="s2">critically we give people the power to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.540" end="00:59:10.920" style="s2">to put their own narratives rather than</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.970" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">have interpreted by tech search by</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.920" end="00:59:15.780" style="s2">algorithm or by experts which means we</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:18.570" style="s2">can scale to very high volume very</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.780" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">quickly so the concepts ourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.570" end="00:59:22.950" style="s2">interpreted we tend to use the words</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:25.800" style="s2">observations as punish these days micro</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.950" end="00:59:28.050" style="s2">observations micro narratives we try and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.800" end="00:59:30.390" style="s2">avoid the story would the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.050" end="00:59:30.930" style="s2">about narrative is it carries ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.390" end="00:59:33.210" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.930" end="00:59:35.130" style="s2">it&#39;s halfway house between say the black</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.130" end="00:59:38.760" style="s2">where to drive it has spent two and a</p>

<p begin="00:59:40.860" end="00:59:45.090" style="s2">explicit data but they can&#39;t out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.900" end="00:59:46.830" style="s2">with a taxi driver but narrative sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.090" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">sits halfway out and the halfway house</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.830" end="00:59:50.970" style="s2">between it so for example some of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">work we did in the US was on narrative</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:56.250" style="s2">enhanced doctrine if you put HTML links</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:58.740" style="s2">to real stories into best practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.250" end="01:00:00.510" style="s2">documents people actually have a richer</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.740" end="01:00:03.270" style="s2">context they know more how to interpret</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.510" end="01:00:05.010" style="s2">the data and actually narrative based</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.270" end="01:00:07.290" style="s2">search will give you better access to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.010" end="01:00:09.210" style="s2">documents and so on so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.290" end="01:00:12.210" style="s2">like a work is micro narrative micro</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.210" end="01:00:14.790" style="s2">scenarios mapping narratives to</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.210" end="01:00:17.820" style="s2">understand culture but critically self</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.790" end="01:00:20.610" style="s2">interpretation of all that narrative not</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.820" end="01:00:22.920" style="s2">machine or expert interpretation as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.610" end="01:00:26.460" style="s2">was doing my research I dug into your</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.920" end="01:00:28.350" style="s2">sense maker software platform I gotta</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.460" end="01:00:29.580" style="s2">tell you your website sucks and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.350" end="01:00:32.610" style="s2">describing it you know there was</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.580" end="01:00:35.010" style="s2">essentially nothing that gave me much of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.610" end="01:00:37.290" style="s2">an idea what it was but fortunately</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.010" end="01:00:39.780" style="s2">being a good Googler I did find some</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.290" end="01:00:42.150" style="s2">great resources written elsewhere one</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.780" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">called making sense of complexity using</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.150" end="01:00:47.550" style="s2">sense maker as a research tool by Dave</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:49.890" style="s2">Snowden&#39;s and some others I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.550" end="01:00:51.960" style="s2">it&#39;s been published yet but it&#39;s a draft</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.890" end="01:00:53.460" style="s2">vailable on the internet I&#39;d recommend</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.960" end="01:00:56.190" style="s2">that the people want to know about sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.460" end="01:00:58.980" style="s2">maker and also a company called Vico ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.190" end="01:01:00.540" style="s2">Co inclusive business scan product</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.980" end="01:01:02.340" style="s2">actually had some pretty nice</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.540" end="01:01:05.790" style="s2">descriptions from a practical</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.340" end="01:01:08.190" style="s2">perspective of how one might use sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.790" end="01:01:10.800" style="s2">maker and it describes it well and in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.190" end="01:01:14.010" style="s2">less academic way than making sense of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.800" end="01:01:15.270" style="s2">complexity paper so with all that said</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.010" end="01:01:18.540" style="s2">is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.270" end="01:01:20.030" style="s2">tell us about sense maker okay we now we</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.540" end="01:01:23.250" style="s2">need to improve the website by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.030" end="01:01:25.290" style="s2">we just created a new website with what</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.250" end="01:01:27.060" style="s2">we call pulses so that&#39;s sort of easy</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.290" end="01:01:29.660" style="s2">entry into the field so that&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.060" end="01:01:33.180" style="s2">at cyber security culture well being</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.660" end="01:01:34.890" style="s2">agile as very rapid sort of uses a sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.180" end="01:01:37.320" style="s2">make advances and attitudes in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.890" end="01:01:38.310" style="s2">domain the best way I&#39;ve explained is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.320" end="01:01:41.310" style="s2">think about an employee satisfaction</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.310" end="01:01:43.290" style="s2">survey so we used to get these all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.310" end="01:01:45.180" style="s2">time in IBM and you get this question</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.290" end="01:01:48.150" style="s2">which says does your manager consult you</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.180" end="01:01:49.590" style="s2">on a regular basis scale of 0 not at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.150" end="01:01:51.900" style="s2">10 all the time and you knew exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.590" end="01:01:53.670" style="s2">what answer they wanted yeah and it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.900" end="01:01:55.890" style="s2">a big annual thing people wrote reports</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.670" end="01:01:58.050" style="s2">consultants analyzed it nobody want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.890" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">do we take a very different approach</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.050" end="01:02:02.070" style="s2">we&#39;ll go to say 10% of the workforce</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.560" style="s2">every month and we&#39;ll ask a non</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.070" end="01:02:06.510" style="s2">hypothesis question so for example what</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.560" end="01:02:08.130" style="s2">story would you tell your best friend if</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.510" end="01:02:10.340" style="s2">they were off the job in your workplace</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.130" end="01:02:13.170" style="s2">and then the individual having either</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.340" end="01:02:15.480" style="s2">spoken that story taking a picture or</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.170" end="01:02:17.490" style="s2">typed or some combination then self</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.480" end="01:02:20.340" style="s2">interprets a story on to a series of</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.490" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">triangles and one of the triangles for</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.340" end="01:02:25.620" style="s2">example as in this story that managed</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:27.930" style="s2">the behavior was altruistic assertive</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.620" end="01:02:29.070" style="s2">analytical so we&#39;re balancing off three</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.930" end="01:02:31.770" style="s2">positive qualities</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.070" end="01:02:33.420" style="s2">now we wired people up for this what it</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.770" end="01:02:35.130" style="s2">does is it triggers a shift come what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.420" end="01:02:37.770" style="s2">got a little autonomic to novelty</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.130" end="01:02:40.410" style="s2">receptive processing what Carmen called</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.770" end="01:02:42.060" style="s2">from thinking faster thinking slow so</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.410" end="01:02:43.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what answers expected</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.060" end="01:02:45.360" style="s2">obvious who force you to think more</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.710" end="01:02:48.300" style="s2">deeply about the subject in a few</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.360" end="01:02:50.940" style="s2">position dots on six triangles you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.300" end="01:02:53.370" style="s2">added 18 metadata points to the original</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.940" end="01:02:56.220" style="s2">narrative and that&#39;s what we analyzed</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.370" end="01:02:58.230" style="s2">and then the original narrative gets</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.220" end="01:03:00.060" style="s2">carried with the statistical data to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.230" end="01:03:02.070" style="s2">effectively provide an explanation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.060" end="01:03:03.870" style="s2">what the statistical patterns mean and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.070" end="01:03:05.460" style="s2">yeah it is heart that&#39;s what says</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.870" end="01:03:08.250" style="s2">speaker does yeah I loved it I could</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.460" end="01:03:10.410" style="s2">spend about three hours digging into it</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.250" end="01:03:11.790" style="s2">and particularly the Triads what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.410" end="01:03:13.650" style="s2">described as two triangles I think they</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.790" end="01:03:15.060" style="s2">are actually called triads and the oft</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.650" end="01:03:17.190" style="s2">where and we&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.060" end="01:03:18.960" style="s2">Chinese organized crime here people</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.190" end="01:03:21.060" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about kind of a three</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.960" end="01:03:22.830" style="s2">dimensional way of positioning your view</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.060" end="01:03:24.900" style="s2">about something in a constrained three</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.830" end="01:03:27.380" style="s2">space struck me as extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.900" end="01:03:29.310" style="s2">useful and might even be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.380" end="01:03:32.220" style="s2">transformational tool in many domains</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.310" end="01:03:34.890" style="s2">you know one that came to mind is it</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.220" end="01:03:37.350" style="s2">could actually be a great replacement</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.890" end="01:03:38.730" style="s2">for political polling yeah we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.350" end="01:03:40.260" style="s2">careful we talk about you but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.730" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">actually done some work on that we may</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.260" end="01:03:45.180" style="s2">even create a new company for it is you</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:46.560" style="s2">need to keep that separate I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.180" end="01:03:48.510" style="s2">thinking of one which to wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.560" end="01:03:52.110" style="s2">create a de novo political party which</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.510" end="01:03:54.270" style="s2">somebody ought to do doing a lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.110" end="01:03:56.730" style="s2">with something like sense maker might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.270" end="01:03:58.680" style="s2">a very interesting way to find out what</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.730" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">shared values there really are in our</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.680" end="01:04:03.150" style="s2">society if somebody wants to approach us</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:05.430" style="s2">we&#39;re already doing projects on that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.150" end="01:04:06.810" style="s2">we&#39;re very keen to extend that work so</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.430" end="01:04:09.210" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find this is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.810" end="01:04:11.880" style="s2">extinction about another stuff so what</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.210" end="01:04:13.770" style="s2">are people got in common yeah you need</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.880" end="01:04:16.440" style="s2">surface presentation and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.770" end="01:04:18.390" style="s2">sense make it pulls out so certainly in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.440" end="01:04:20.040" style="s2">political use it can be used by for</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.390" end="01:04:22.020" style="s2">example field workers to gather stories</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.040" end="01:04:23.550" style="s2">from people and then people self</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.020" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">interpret their own stories so you not</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.550" end="01:04:27.030" style="s2">reliant on interpretation what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">done in social work for example is</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.030" end="01:04:30.930" style="s2">social workers you know capture stories</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.520" style="s2">before and after a visit but then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.930" end="01:04:34.770" style="s2">people who are their clients can tell</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.520" end="01:04:36.840" style="s2">and interpret their own story so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.770" end="01:04:38.070" style="s2">not reliant on the experts to mediate it</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.840" end="01:04:40.620" style="s2">and that was the point I was making</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.070" end="01:04:42.990" style="s2">earlier on the children&#39;s stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.620" end="01:04:45.390" style="s2">sense makers serve 16 year olds actors</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.990" end="01:04:47.430" style="s2">ethnographers to their community we</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.390" end="01:04:49.290" style="s2">gather quantity large volume very</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.430" end="01:04:51.300" style="s2">quickly which is almost impossible for</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.290" end="01:04:53.130" style="s2">people to manipulate but they can</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.300" end="01:04:54.600" style="s2">manipulate Facebook and Twitter and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.130" end="01:04:56.670" style="s2">other thing that I believe I read in</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.600" end="01:04:59.700" style="s2">some of the materials if not it comes</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.670" end="01:05:01.470" style="s2">you know by extrapolation is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.700" end="01:05:03.990" style="s2">use self-scoring the turnaround can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.470" end="01:05:05.700" style="s2">very rapid you know going back to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.990" end="01:05:09.420" style="s2">know your description of those goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.700" end="01:05:11.460" style="s2">corporate surveys right everybody wastes</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.420" end="01:05:13.710" style="s2">two hours filling the damn things out</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.460" end="01:05:15.540" style="s2">then the stupid-ass company that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.710" end="01:05:17.220" style="s2">company you work for hired to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.540" end="01:05:19.020" style="s2">it spends three or four months</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.220" end="01:05:21.090" style="s2">tabulating the data and running some</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.020" end="01:05:22.650" style="s2">bogus statistics and management doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.090" end="01:05:24.900" style="s2">even hear about it for six months while</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.650" end="01:05:27.690" style="s2">presumably using fence maker and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.900" end="01:05:29.550" style="s2">self-scoring you could have the results</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.690" end="01:05:31.170" style="s2">in hours you can have the results</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.550" end="01:05:34.350" style="s2">instantly actually I mean another</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.170" end="01:05:37.290" style="s2">example is his 360 360 is a major gained</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.350" end="01:05:38.940" style="s2">issue every year yeah it value as if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.290" end="01:05:40.380" style="s2">I said of a website and IBM where you</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.940" end="01:05:42.210" style="s2">could nominate to be somebody&#39;s third</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.380" end="01:05:44.280" style="s2">quartile responder which Shh I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.210" end="01:05:45.240" style="s2">pissed off with me over we do something</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.280" end="01:05:47.430" style="s2">different so you&#39;re a leader you</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.240" end="01:05:49.050" style="s2">nominate X number of people every time</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.430" end="01:05:51.090" style="s2">they interact with you they record the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.050" end="01:05:52.530" style="s2">interaction they index it onto six</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.090" end="01:05:54.210" style="s2">trials which have all positive</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.530" end="01:05:55.800" style="s2">leadership qualities and then you see</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.210" end="01:05:57.360" style="s2">how they see you and that&#39;s a real-time</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.800" end="01:05:59.430" style="s2">mechanism and it&#39;s descriptive not</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.360" end="01:06:01.710" style="s2">evaluative so you can sit down with you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.430" end="01:06:04.260" style="s2">guys and say look an old altruist an old</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.710" end="01:06:05.850" style="s2">analytical assertive very little</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.260" end="01:06:07.860" style="s2">altruism how do I get more of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.850" end="01:06:09.480" style="s2">rather than the sort of evaluative thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.860" end="01:06:11.850" style="s2">at the end of every year great and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.480" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">ain&#39;t gotta say people I endorsed at</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.850" end="01:06:15.540" style="s2">least in principle sense maker based on</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:17.370" style="s2">what I could extract out of it and I am</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.540" end="01:06:19.110" style="s2">pretty good at understanding these kinds</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.370" end="01:06:20.970" style="s2">of complex tools and I would love to get</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.110" end="01:06:23.220" style="s2">my hands on it at some point use it on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.970" end="01:06:24.810" style="s2">real project give me the compass that</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.220" end="01:06:26.700" style="s2">the postage makes are designed to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.810" end="01:06:28.860" style="s2">it really easy step three J</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.700" end="01:06:31.080" style="s2">pre-configure just go run them that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.860" end="01:06:34.050" style="s2">would be cool so we talked about what I</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.080" end="01:06:36.420" style="s2">know so far about your work up till now</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.050" end="01:06:41.100" style="s2">what if I miss let&#39;s start with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.420" end="01:06:43.260" style="s2">I think the work is about how do people</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.100" end="01:06:45.090" style="s2">make better decisions like where I came</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.260" end="01:06:48.510" style="s2">from that was my original thesis four</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.090" end="01:06:50.310" style="s2">years back yeah the big stuff we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.510" end="01:06:51.960" style="s2">doing like the children the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.310" end="01:06:53.880" style="s2">project they talked about the work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.960" end="01:06:55.740" style="s2">about to start on global warming to</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.880" end="01:06:58.890" style="s2">understand how we can make people aware</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.740" end="01:07:01.470" style="s2">of the issue at a local level we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.890" end="01:07:05.040" style="s2">a big project running on understanding</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.470" end="01:07:07.050" style="s2">abuse in partnerships and then using the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.040" end="01:07:10.100" style="s2">narrative as a therapeutic device to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.050" end="01:07:13.200" style="s2">hook people at the narcissistic control</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.100" end="01:07:16.410" style="s2">so my own direction now is focused on</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:18.210" style="s2">democracy on education here on how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.410" end="01:07:20.790" style="s2">create a more humane society and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.210" end="01:07:23.070" style="s2">conditions of control restraint that</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.790" end="01:07:25.260" style="s2">means that a lot of the cognitive side</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.070" end="01:07:27.270" style="s2">of this is coming forward and we just</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.260" end="01:07:28.950" style="s2">did this big retreat in Whistler last</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.270" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">year we created a</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.950" end="01:07:33.210" style="s2">new approach design thinking based on</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:35.970" style="s2">complexity which is about to launch that</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.210" end="01:07:37.410" style="s2">was in over three retreats this year</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.970" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">we&#39;re working at decisions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.410" end="01:07:41.730" style="s2">perception that will come out in May the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:44.010" style="s2">year after that we&#39;re looking at meaning</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.730" end="01:07:46.320" style="s2">and identity so what I&#39;m really doing is</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.010" end="01:07:48.570" style="s2">to take a natural science approach to</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.320" end="01:07:51.359" style="s2">social systems rather than the case</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.570" end="01:07:52.890" style="s2">based inductive approach and for me</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.359" end="01:07:54.570" style="s2">that&#39;s critical my originally degree</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.890" end="01:07:56.310" style="s2">with physics and philosophy that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.570" end="01:07:57.750" style="s2">taught we&#39;d have a contempt for social</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.310" end="01:07:59.460" style="s2">science from to completely different</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.750" end="01:08:01.619" style="s2">disciplines and I&#39;m really shaking it</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.460" end="01:08:04.380" style="s2">off since you know so using natural</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.619" end="01:08:05.820" style="s2">science to inform human polity is kinda</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.380" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">like where we are sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.820" end="01:08:11.490" style="s2">moving away from the focus on corporate</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.400" end="01:08:14.010" style="s2">America and our world corporations and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.490" end="01:08:15.960" style="s2">moving more into the social and</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.010" end="01:08:18.210" style="s2">political spheres it&#39;s a nice to meet</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.960" end="01:08:20.160" style="s2">our cognitive edge we just got new</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.210" end="01:08:22.410" style="s2">investors and so the commercial side of</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.160" end="01:08:24.239" style="s2">that is building yeah and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.410" end="01:08:26.279" style="s2">element to what goes on and I inform</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.239" end="01:08:29.009" style="s2">that I&#39;m the R&amp;D hub for that now rather</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.279" end="01:08:31.259" style="s2">than the execution but you actually find</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.009" end="01:08:32.850" style="s2">the R&amp;D and the big social projects has</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.259" end="01:08:34.469" style="s2">commissioned application I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.850" end="01:08:37.620" style="s2">stuff we did on counterterrorism has</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.469" end="01:08:39.779" style="s2">huge commercial application you know but</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.620" end="01:08:41.430" style="s2">I&#39;m more interested in creating it when</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.779" end="01:08:42.750" style="s2">I used to say for my grandchildren I</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.430" end="01:08:44.489" style="s2">thought my children though I think I</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.750" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">maybe hope to create a safer space for</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.489" end="01:08:49.140" style="s2">me isn&#39;t that ridiculous I mean I used</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">to there&#39;s a 1% chance of a social</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.140" end="01:08:55.529" style="s2">collapse in my lifetime when I was 30</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:57.450" style="s2">right now I&#39;m 65 and I it&#39;s 20% and</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.529" end="01:08:59.880" style="s2">instead of having an expected life</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.450" end="01:09:02.190" style="s2">expectancy of 65 years I have a life</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.880" end="01:09:04.440" style="s2">expectancy of 25 years what is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.190" end="01:09:06.750" style="s2">with this story right we&#39;re not on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.440" end="01:09:08.819" style="s2">same ways and with the same age pretty</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.750" end="01:09:12.029" style="s2">much now sort of between the two between</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.819" end="01:09:15.089" style="s2">you know de novo work on social systems</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.029" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">and say corporate work there&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.089" end="01:09:20.520" style="s2">of existing social science</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:22.380" style="s2">have you found interest in practicing</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.520" end="01:09:24.569" style="s2">social scientists say in the university</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.380" end="01:09:27.150" style="s2">context in your approach</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.569" end="01:09:29.910" style="s2">there&#39;s thousands of switch alright so</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.150" end="01:09:31.469" style="s2">complexities was kind of like ignored I</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.910" end="01:09:33.450" style="s2">think the problem you got with social</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.469" end="01:09:35.370" style="s2">science is a lot of them is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.450" end="01:09:37.580" style="s2">in very tight sort of debates say</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.370" end="01:09:39.400" style="s2">between modernism and post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.580" end="01:09:41.890" style="s2">between social because</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.400" end="01:09:43.330" style="s2">vism and critical realism and to my mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.890" end="01:09:44.230" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s debates a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.330" end="01:09:46.630" style="s2">meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.230" end="01:09:48.760" style="s2">I called them horseshit yeah well I</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.630" end="01:09:50.470" style="s2">think there&#39;s some interesting things in</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.760" end="01:09:53.080" style="s2">them but you&#39;ve got to be careful I</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.470" end="01:09:54.820" style="s2">think and I was it a cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.080" end="01:09:59.290" style="s2">society thing you know Danbury recently</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.820" end="01:10:00.850" style="s2">yeah and I raised some research outside</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.290" end="01:10:02.440" style="s2">the field of the people there yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.850" end="01:10:04.750" style="s2">said you know Andy Clark work on</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.440" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">extending cognition bye-bye bang and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.750" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">as the lecturer said yes I know about</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.400" end="01:10:12.040" style="s2">that but if it&#39;s true it invalidates 50</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:13.750" style="s2">years of experimental psychology so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.040" end="01:10:15.310" style="s2">not taking it seriously but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.750" end="01:10:17.080" style="s2">Matt&#39;s a troubled social science has</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.310" end="01:10:19.120" style="s2">become highly self referential and</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.080" end="01:10:20.830" style="s2">highly focused on postal production</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.120" end="01:10:23.350" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got to produce X papers</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.830" end="01:10:25.390" style="s2">per year to get keep Tonia and so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.350" end="01:10:27.100" style="s2">chance to own your ideas you really have</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.390" end="01:10:28.810" style="s2">to do that inside of academic life for</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.100" end="01:10:30.670" style="s2">the man or have tenure yeah even in</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.810" end="01:10:32.620" style="s2">Tonia there&#39;s still the huge pressure on</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.670" end="01:10:34.900" style="s2">that yeah and then at you you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.620" end="01:10:36.760" style="s2">quite say it but I&#39;ll say it altogether</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.900" end="01:10:38.440" style="s2">too much of social science today is</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.760" end="01:10:41.410" style="s2">politics by other means</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.440" end="01:10:43.330" style="s2">yeah and I think yeah I wrote a blog</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.410" end="01:10:45.160" style="s2">post on this I said you know natural</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.330" end="01:10:47.350" style="s2">science gives us explanation and</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.160" end="01:10:49.660" style="s2">prediction social science can give us</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.350" end="01:10:51.460" style="s2">explanation but not prediction if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.660" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">actually say your social science gives</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.460" end="01:10:54.820" style="s2">you a predictive capacity which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.830" style="s2">almost management sciences then you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.820" end="01:10:58.720" style="s2">pseudoscience and then there&#39;s a fourth</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.830" end="01:11:01.000" style="s2">alternative which is what we do is use</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.720" end="01:11:03.430" style="s2">natural science as a constraint on what</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.000" end="01:11:06.010" style="s2">you can do in social systems well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.430" end="01:11:07.510" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting actually could</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.010" end="01:11:09.690" style="s2">you elaborate on that a little bit let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.510" end="01:11:12.550" style="s2">let&#39;s bring it back to the more mundane</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.690" end="01:11:13.870" style="s2">exactly running a company I teach this</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.550" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">to senior executives there are some</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.870" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">basic facts we know so we know for</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:20.830" style="s2">example inattentional blindness right so</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:22.660" style="s2">if you give a bunch of radiologists</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.830" end="01:11:24.310" style="s2">about your x-rays on one of the x-rays</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.660" end="01:11:26.410" style="s2">you put your picture of a gorilla which</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.310" end="01:11:29.110" style="s2">is 48 times the size of a cancer module</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.410" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">then 83% of radiologists wouldn&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.110" end="01:11:32.830" style="s2">even though their eyes scan it so a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.360" end="01:11:34.720" style="s2">natural science approach says right</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.830" end="01:11:37.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the case so we&#39;ve got to find the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.720" end="01:11:39.700" style="s2">17% we can&#39;t train people not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.540" end="01:11:42.850" style="s2">we need to create systems which find the</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.700" end="01:11:44.950" style="s2">17% before they talk to the 83% and</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.850" end="01:11:46.990" style="s2">that&#39;s what we do when I mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.950" end="01:11:49.090" style="s2">earlier about math sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.990" end="01:11:50.920" style="s2">paying something out the whole workforce</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.090" end="01:11:52.599" style="s2">to you find out a lot of communities we</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.920" end="01:11:55.030" style="s2">go talk with them so that&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.599" end="01:11:57.099" style="s2">right we know they&#39;re complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.030" end="01:11:58.750" style="s2">system you haven&#39;t got linear causality</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.099" end="01:12:00.310" style="s2">therefore you stop talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.750" end="01:12:02.920" style="s2">future and you focus on mapping the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.310" end="01:12:04.750" style="s2">present so what natural size gives you</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.920" end="01:12:07.329" style="s2">is his tight focus on what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.750" end="01:12:08.860" style="s2">possible as opposed to what most</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.329" end="01:12:10.869" style="s2">management science has been doing for</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.860" end="01:12:12.699" style="s2">the past 40 years which is a series of</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.869" end="01:12:14.500" style="s2">fads each of which claims to have found</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.699" end="01:12:16.449" style="s2">the solution to the problem but like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.500" end="01:12:18.010" style="s2">universe and everything each of which</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.449" end="01:12:20.290" style="s2">the last three or four years then dies</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.010" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">yeah because there&#39;s no scientific base</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.290" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">to any of them they&#39;re all fictional</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:25.989" style="s2">constructs and indeed if you go back at</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:28.929" style="s2">backtest them you find most of them</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.989" end="01:12:30.489" style="s2">don&#39;t back down at all and people love</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.929" end="01:12:32.349" style="s2">it it&#39;s like I mean myers-briggs for</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.489" end="01:12:34.750" style="s2">example is using all corporate monitors</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.349" end="01:12:36.550" style="s2">being proved to be a pseudoscience more</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.750" end="01:12:38.710" style="s2">times than I care to imagine but it will</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.550" end="01:12:40.270" style="s2">carry on using it not so profitable for</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.710" end="01:12:42.699" style="s2">the consultant right you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.270" end="01:12:44.770" style="s2">that&#39;s the driver to my mind of most of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.699" end="01:12:46.750" style="s2">this management faddish &#39;no SPECT i</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.770" end="01:12:48.310" style="s2">generally tell people when they ask me</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.750" end="01:12:50.619" style="s2">what do i read i say almost anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.310" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">except books about management right</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.619" end="01:12:56.949" style="s2">right I saw a Forbes article earlier on</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:59.079" style="s2">today about dodging agile was the future</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.949" end="01:13:00.340" style="s2">of everything and I based the other two</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.079" end="01:13:01.960" style="s2">coming to it said I could have written</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.340" end="01:13:03.730" style="s2">exactly the same thing about every other</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.960" end="01:13:05.290" style="s2">management movement the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.730" end="01:13:07.540" style="s2">and the author actually wrote some of</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.290" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">them so why should we believe this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.540" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">another fad is not based in anything we</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:13.449" style="s2">know from science I mean each of these</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:16.030" style="s2">fads had some applicability I mean they</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.449" end="01:13:19.510" style="s2">are definitely some situations where</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.030" end="01:13:21.420" style="s2">right sizing was a very valid strategy</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.510" end="01:13:23.619" style="s2">but it&#39;s you know no free lunch theory</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.420" end="01:13:25.750" style="s2">so there&#39;s nothing wrong with business</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.619" end="01:13:28.420" style="s2">process reengineering till it became Six</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.750" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">Sigma exactly right that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.420" end="01:13:31.780" style="s2">the no free lunch theorem there is no</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:34.449" style="s2">one answer to every problem you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.780" end="01:13:36.489" style="s2">understand your domain first I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.449" end="01:13:38.290" style="s2">did a program in IBM which actually it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.489" end="01:13:39.849" style="s2">was a three month experiment we proved</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.290" end="01:13:41.889" style="s2">astrology was more accurate than</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.849" end="01:13:43.449" style="s2">myers-briggs in predicting team behavior</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.889" end="01:13:45.489" style="s2">and for some reason they got upset with</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.449" end="01:13:46.960" style="s2">me and the point I made is if you get</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.489" end="01:13:48.969" style="s2">people to think about themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.960" end="01:13:50.469" style="s2">different it has utility so you might as</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.969" end="01:13:52.060" style="s2">well use astrology because then nobody</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.469" end="01:13:53.500" style="s2">will take it seriously but they&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.060" end="01:13:55.659" style="s2">it properly but either way that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.500" end="01:13:58.360" style="s2">go down well you get four twelve tribes</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.659" end="01:14:00.219" style="s2">for free right you did maybe that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.360" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">that matters that you have twelve tribes</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.219" end="01:14:04.180" style="s2">not what</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">maybe scary as well alright if you go to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.180" end="01:14:08.380" style="s2">core astrology then there goes work very</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.380" end="01:14:13.450" style="s2">don&#39;t it has been true all my life I&#39;m</p>
