<p begin="00:01:27.469" end="00:01:36.889" style="s2">would really hope we can make of it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.520" end="00:01:40.029" style="s2">2006 I went to a conference where the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.889" end="00:01:43.039" style="s2">keynote speaker was Steven Scott Glenn</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.029" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">he&#39;s a very dynamic speaker and he told</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.039" end="00:01:49.420" style="s2">a story about Einstein and Einstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">predictions and visions for the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.420" end="00:01:55.909" style="s2">pretty much in the time period we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:58.609" style="s2">living now and Einstein said that in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.909" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">future machines would take care of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.609" end="00:02:05.810" style="s2">of the knowledge base work that we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:07.069" style="s2">now or we had done in the past just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.810" end="00:02:10.520" style="s2">machines take care of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.069" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">repetitive physical work for us Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.520" end="00:02:14.900" style="s2">saw that knowledge itself would become</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:17.209" style="s2">in the future like data was for him then</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.900" end="00:02:19.790" style="s2">there was organizing storing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.209" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">retrieving data was the work of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.790" end="00:02:23.609" style="s2">computers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">a what we&#39;re seeing with smarter and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.609" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">smarter computers and the development of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:32.189" style="s2">artificial intelligence and the Semantic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:36.019" style="s2">Web and crowdsourcing and having</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.189" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">computers learned from collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.019" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">engagement with people what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:45.629" style="s2">is that machines are being able to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:50.069" style="s2">very confident in organizing storing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.629" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">retrieving knowledge so in the past they</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.069" end="00:02:55.049" style="s2">exclusively machines exclusively worked</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.419" style="s2">with data and it required people to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.049" end="00:03:00.510" style="s2">the data to make into knowledge systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.419" end="00:03:03.569" style="s2">but today we&#39;re finding as I as an Isaan</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.510" end="00:03:06.049" style="s2">Feinstein predicted that machines are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.569" end="00:03:07.980" style="s2">getting increasingly better than us at</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.049" end="00:03:10.139" style="s2">organized storing and retrieving</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.980" end="00:03:14.069" style="s2">knowledge so this has huge implications</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.139" end="00:03:17.459" style="s2">it has huge implications for students</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.069" end="00:03:19.139" style="s2">entering college at this time in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.459" end="00:03:22.919" style="s2">of what are going we are going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.139" end="00:03:25.500" style="s2">careers available to them so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.919" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">implication that means for me today is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.500" end="00:03:31.799" style="s2">that our responsibilities as adults and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">educators is to support the development</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.799" end="00:03:41.609" style="s2">of skills in young adults that machines</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">can&#39;t do that our responsibility is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.609" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">cultivate new capacities perhaps in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">instances in human development that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:53.720" style="s2">beyond the range of technology at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:57.689" style="s2">moment and then everything moves along</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.720" end="00:04:02.750" style="s2">so that was one of the first really</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.689" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">important signposts for me back in 2006</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.750" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">in 2006 in that same keynote speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:15.199" style="s2">Stephen Glen said that Einstein was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:18.979" style="s2">fascinated with the rate of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.199" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">throughout you know recent history in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.979" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">that in the past for example my parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">parents knowledge doubled so slowly that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:31.700" style="s2">the only responsibility parents and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:33.860" style="s2">cheers had was to reproduce the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.700" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">knowledge that they had been given and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.860" end="00:04:40.730" style="s2">make sure that that was adequately</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:44.389" style="s2">passed on to their children fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.730" end="00:04:46.970" style="s2">to when I was in college it seemed to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.389" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">that knowledge was doubling so rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.970" end="00:04:53.270" style="s2">that by the time you got into college</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:57.410" style="s2">you were faced with research agendas</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.270" end="00:05:00.740" style="s2">into the unknown and recently I heard a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.410" end="00:05:02.780" style="s2">man speak about the kind of pickle that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.740" end="00:05:06.860" style="s2">children are in in terms of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.780" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">that when there by the time they receive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:10.130" style="s2">all the knowledge in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">discipline then that knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.130" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">already obsolete and so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:16.850" style="s2">faced with skills that they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">learned so if you&#39;re graduating from</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.850" end="00:05:23.210" style="s2">college and you have all this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:25.460" style="s2">and even in many of the sciences you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.210" end="00:05:28.490" style="s2">have to go on to post doc and docx drill</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.460" end="00:05:30.200" style="s2">so you might spend 30 years in an</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.490" end="00:05:32.810" style="s2">institution where you&#39;re just receiving</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.200" end="00:05:35.390" style="s2">knowledge but then by the time you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.810" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">accumulated all that knowledge then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.390" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">research has really advanced way forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really hard for children at</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:45.770" style="s2">that stage or adults at that stage to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:47.419" style="s2">make the transition to where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.770" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">doing research where they&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.419" end="00:05:53.419" style="s2">questions of the unknown so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.600" end="00:05:57.410" style="s2">second sign post in that keynote speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.419" end="00:06:00.500" style="s2">that really got me to thinking and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.410" end="00:06:03.100" style="s2">the third thing that&#39;s Stephen a Glenn</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.500" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">said in the keynote speech was that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.100" end="00:06:08.530" style="s2">again the rate of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">developing so fast that now knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.530" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">doubles faster than a generation I read</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">something the other day that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">doubles in less than a year so if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.580" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">really take that to heart what what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">is saying is that by the time children</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:31.550" style="s2">are born and into our responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">then we don&#39;t know what to teach them we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.550" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">we are way behind the curve ball here</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">and so knowledge is doubling so fast</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.030" end="00:06:48.070" style="s2">that we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:50.890" style="s2">situation where we are not only teaching</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.070" end="00:06:56.170" style="s2">our children skills to face an unknown</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.890" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">future but in unknowable future and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.170" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">had a really big impact on me so we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:03.490" style="s2">these three aspects number one that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:06.180" style="s2">machines are going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.490" end="00:07:09.370" style="s2">organize store and retrieve knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.180" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">better than humans so that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.370" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">to develop capacities way ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.060" end="00:07:20.680" style="s2">technological curve number two that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">research is requires so much received</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.680" end="00:07:27.930" style="s2">knowledge that by the time you actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:30.940" style="s2">internalize all those knowledge you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.930" end="00:07:33.490" style="s2">number one are way behind the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:35.830" style="s2">number two don&#39;t have the skills for</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.490" end="00:07:40.480" style="s2">doing action inquiry into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.830" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">for innovation in an invention in number</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.480" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">three that educators and teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:50.500" style="s2">parents are in the situation of having</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">to design an educational system and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:07:57.460" style="s2">having to support their children in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">capacity of creating capabilities for</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.460" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">them to fix not only an unknown future</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:05.920" style="s2">but an unknowable future and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">really really really need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.920" end="00:08:11.290" style="s2">to heart that we need to stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.860" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">that our children need received</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.290" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">knowledge not only do they not need it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:18.880" style="s2">but that can be handled by machines but</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:21.790" style="s2">that it is doing them a disservice and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:25.410" style="s2">the third point is that we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.790" end="00:08:27.940" style="s2">on the responsibility of identifying</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.410" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">what are the capabilities that our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.940" end="00:08:33.970" style="s2">children need to face an unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.880" end="00:08:35.860" style="s2">unknowable future to talk to them like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.970" end="00:08:39.130" style="s2">that to say we don&#39;t know what your</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:42.760" style="s2">future is going to be like what we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.130" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">do is support your own growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.760" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">capacities that you will need to face an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.320" end="00:09:00.070" style="s2">future recently I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.030" end="00:09:02.590" style="s2">how special and innovative and creative</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.070" end="00:09:05.290" style="s2">young adults are and I&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.590" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">around the country doing workshops on</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.290" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">inside practice and inevitably when</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:16.750" style="s2">there are intergenerational people in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:21.820" style="s2">workshop it is very clear that young</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:24.060" style="s2">adults would say 35 and younger have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.820" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">completely different mindset a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.060" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">completely different understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:32.670" style="s2">how of change in the world how change</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">happens the kinds of process</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:38.230" style="s2">methodologies that are important to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that this is schooled</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.230" end="00:09:43.590" style="s2">in them I think that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">evolutionary leap and I&#39;ll tell you why</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.590" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">my research has shown me that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">most significant changes or significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.860" end="00:09:56.200" style="s2">situations we are dealing with today in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:10:01.450" style="s2">terms of this educational and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.200" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">intergenerational aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.450" end="00:10:08.860" style="s2">situation is that children are now born</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">into a world that&#39;s so technologically</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.860" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">advanced that this makes a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:17.500" style="s2">difference in how they come to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:20.050" style="s2">about reality so for example I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.500" end="00:10:23.500" style="s2">before I was grew up in a school system</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.050" end="00:10:26.110" style="s2">before there were personal computers</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.500" end="00:10:28.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen the development of personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:32.170" style="s2">computers over time I&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.870" end="00:10:36.070" style="s2">the beginning in both in business and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.170" end="00:10:40.120" style="s2">school and I&#39;ve seen how how the web has</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.070" end="00:10:47.320" style="s2">changed over the last ten years so for</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.120" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">me this has a the internet is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.320" end="00:10:51.850" style="s2">a relative or a contingent aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.330" style="s2">reality I remember what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.850" end="00:10:57.910" style="s2">before but for children who are now</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.330" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">thrown into the world where a digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.910" end="00:11:00.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:04.990" style="s2">the world of digital technology in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.520" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">internet in collective intelligence this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.990" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">is not a contingent aspect of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:14.140" style="s2">world this is the real world and so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">creates a situation where the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.140" end="00:11:19.390" style="s2">feedbacks to them in a much different</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:22.060" style="s2">way than it did to us and this creates</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.390" end="00:11:24.820" style="s2">actual evolutionary leap in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.060" end="00:11:28.300" style="s2">cognitive architecture of our children</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.820" end="00:11:30.670" style="s2">so this is another situation that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.300" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">think as educators we have to take to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.670" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">heart and we have to design education</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.410" end="00:11:38.080" style="s2">now for children that in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">in the context that they&#39;re worn</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.080" end="00:11:42.700" style="s2">actually smarter than us that they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:45.010" style="s2">insights into this world that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.700" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">have simply by the fact of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.010" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">thoroughness this thrown into a world</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:55.390" style="s2">that is different than the world we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:58.600" style="s2">experienced as children so I like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.390" end="00:12:00.520" style="s2">tell children that they are penguins and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.600" end="00:12:03.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a little story I wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.520" end="00:12:05.170" style="s2">with you there&#39;s this great documentary</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.580" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">called march of the penguins you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.170" end="00:12:13.180" style="s2">probably have seen it and most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">remember the part of the story where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.180" end="00:12:21.780" style="s2">Penguins take the Long March and deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:25.510" style="s2">into the Antarctic and they pair up and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.780" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">the female lays an egg and then the egg</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.510" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">gets passed to the male and females make</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:34.870" style="s2">the long march to the sea to feed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:37.300" style="s2">then in this in the early spring the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.870" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">females make the long march back the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.300" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">chicks are born they exchange they find</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">their mate they exchange their chick and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">the males make the long march to the sea</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:51.610" style="s2">because they&#39;re starving so most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:54.060" style="s2">remember the story for the profound</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.610" end="00:12:57.850" style="s2">challenges of parenthood and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:13:00.970" style="s2">responsibilities so but for me the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.850" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">surprising and the thing that stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.970" end="00:13:08.350" style="s2">me the most was at the point then that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:11.180" style="s2">the the mothers are now feeding their</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.350" end="00:13:14.450" style="s2">chicks just from the storage</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.180" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">of food that they had been eating when</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.450" end="00:13:19.100" style="s2">they were in the sea and the chicks are</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">growing in the and the mothers are</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.100" end="00:13:23.540" style="s2">starting to starve to death so then at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:27.230" style="s2">certain point they make the long march</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.540" end="00:13:30.050" style="s2">to the sea back to feed and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.230" end="00:13:32.660" style="s2">interesting things is the chicks wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.050" end="00:13:35.660" style="s2">they&#39;re all the same generation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.660" end="00:13:39.260" style="s2">all cousins and they wait and they wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.660" end="00:13:42.980" style="s2">and they wait and what they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.260" end="00:13:45.380" style="s2">is no one&#39;s coming back for them so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.980" end="00:13:47.570" style="s2">is extraordinary because in the movie</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.380" end="00:13:50.180" style="s2">you see they&#39;re all the chicks are</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.570" end="00:13:52.400" style="s2">getting hungry and restless and they all</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.180" end="00:13:54.470" style="s2">kind of like congregate and move around</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.400" end="00:13:56.410" style="s2">nervously and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.470" end="00:14:00.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.410" end="00:14:02.930" style="s2">self-organizing scene happening and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.680" end="00:14:05.690" style="s2">natural born leaders start to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.930" end="00:14:08.330" style="s2">together in little groups and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.690" end="00:14:11.150" style="s2">a congress and they and they they kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.330" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">of like talk to each other and it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.150" end="00:14:17.780" style="s2">looks like they&#39;re making decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:20.500" style="s2">the whole colony kind of self organizes</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.780" end="00:14:24.740" style="s2">as if they&#39;re the central meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.500" end="00:14:27.020" style="s2">this generation and then that at some</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.740" end="00:14:30.380" style="s2">point some inner knowing kicks in and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.020" end="00:14:33.880" style="s2">then that little Congress starts to lead</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.380" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">and they make the march to the sea and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.880" end="00:14:42.980" style="s2">at each point where there&#39;s challenges</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:45.320" style="s2">or maybe fissures or water holes or some</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.980" end="00:14:47.960" style="s2">dangers then that little Congress gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.320" end="00:14:50.990" style="s2">together like trying kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.960" end="00:14:52.970" style="s2">collectively making a decision and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.990" end="00:14:56.150" style="s2">move forward until they get to the sea</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.970" end="00:14:58.370" style="s2">and this is a generation that has never</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.150" end="00:15:01.250" style="s2">made the march it&#39;s all from an inner</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.370" end="00:15:03.140" style="s2">knowing led by natural born leaders they</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.250" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">get to the sea they&#39;ve never seen the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.140" end="00:15:08.060" style="s2">sea before and in the last scenes of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:10.370" style="s2">movie the same kind of initiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.060" end="00:15:13.070" style="s2">happens where the Congress starts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.370" end="00:15:15.200" style="s2">walk into the water and they get to like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.070" end="00:15:17.450" style="s2">cackling to each other and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.200" end="00:15:17.830" style="s2">someone dies and then the next one the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.450" end="00:15:20.980" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.830" end="00:15:26.610" style="s2">one and that becomes a generation that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.980" end="00:15:28.900" style="s2">lives together so I like to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.610" end="00:15:32.350" style="s2">generations that are born today as</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.900" end="00:15:35.200" style="s2">penguins because of this rapid advance</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.350" end="00:15:41.260" style="s2">of both technology and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.200" end="00:15:44.650" style="s2">building in a sense they&#39;re born left</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.260" end="00:15:46.750" style="s2">alone they are born to self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.650" end="00:15:48.760" style="s2">they are in a situation where they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">to find each other find their natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.760" end="00:15:54.970" style="s2">born leaders self-organized and move</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:57.760" style="s2">into an unknown future from some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.970" end="00:16:00.610" style="s2">deep inner knowing that we as educators</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.760" end="00:16:03.790" style="s2">teachers and parents need to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.610" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">to cultivate and for them and how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.790" end="00:16:13.030" style="s2">support the cultivation of that so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:18.060" style="s2">is what for me over the last 12 years or</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.030" end="00:16:21.310" style="s2">so has been a progression progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.060" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">research inquiry and understanding into</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.310" end="00:16:30.220" style="s2">what what do we need to be as educators</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:34.930" style="s2">adults and parents to really support</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.220" end="00:16:38.010" style="s2">children into transforming their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.930" end="00:16:40.420" style="s2">future and I think this is an essential</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.010" end="00:16:43.050" style="s2">responsibility that we have at this time</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.420" end="00:16:43.050" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.519" end="00:16:53.059" style="s2">so now what I want to do is try to give</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.220" end="00:16:56.540" style="s2">you a little idea of some of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.059" end="00:17:01.459" style="s2">that we have organized this first summer</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.540" end="00:17:06.919" style="s2">soul experience in order to address some</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.459" end="00:17:11.209" style="s2">of that larger vision I have this little</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.919" end="00:17:14.019" style="s2">diagram I made this morning which I hope</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.209" end="00:17:14.019" style="s2">you can see</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.809" end="00:17:46.100" style="s2">so we&#39;ve designed the experience the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.149" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">learning experience at all the lower</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">around three primary modes of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.490" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">educational experience and I see this as</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.269" end="00:18:10.250" style="s2">a generative process that that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:12.289" style="s2">process enables improvement in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.250" end="00:18:14.889" style="s2">process which enables improvement in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.289" end="00:18:21.110" style="s2">this process it really generates a whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.889" end="00:18:26.149" style="s2">learning experience so one part one</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.110" end="00:18:31.519" style="s2">stream of the experience is has to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.149" end="00:18:36.500" style="s2">with research the ability to come up</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.519" end="00:18:42.289" style="s2">with novel questions about that are not</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.500" end="00:18:49.149" style="s2">that are not knowns and to start a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.289" end="00:18:53.649" style="s2">process of active inquiry and research</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.149" end="00:19:00.169" style="s2">in a way that moves that question along</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.649" end="00:19:03.860" style="s2">and the way that we support the research</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.169" end="00:19:06.919" style="s2">of the student is through insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.860" end="00:19:11.090" style="s2">practice because you can&#39;t ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.919" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">of the unknown without having at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.090" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">some insight some insight as to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">hypothesis or a proposition or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:30.019" style="s2">relevant question and that what that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">looks like primarily is collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.019" end="00:19:36.740" style="s2">insect we do collective insight practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:41.080" style="s2">here at at all the lore all the lore is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.740" end="00:19:41.080" style="s2">the home of all dolor insight Center</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.809" end="00:19:48.700" style="s2">students engage in what I call</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.000" end="00:19:50.889" style="s2">contemplative science because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.700" end="00:19:53.409" style="s2">science to do research but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.889" end="00:19:56.679" style="s2">contemplative aspect of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.409" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">ability to watch into compote</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.679" end="00:20:02.379" style="s2">contemplate and be self-reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:05.470" style="s2">one&#39;s inside process and why does it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.379" end="00:20:09.549" style="s2">matter so this generates novel questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.470" end="00:20:13.889" style="s2">and novel approaches to a research</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.549" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">project so we have contemplative science</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.889" end="00:20:29.070" style="s2">collective insight practice and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:31.899" style="s2">research the other process stream is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.070" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">project stream so in order to do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.899" end="00:20:39.269" style="s2">research it needs to be designed into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:41.799" style="s2">project so a project could be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.269" end="00:20:44.200" style="s2">multimedia project it could be an</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.799" end="00:20:48.279" style="s2">interview project it could be a research</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.200" end="00:20:52.600" style="s2">traditional academic research project</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.279" end="00:20:56.169" style="s2">working through the internet it could be</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.600" end="00:20:57.940" style="s2">a building project in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.169" end="00:21:00.789" style="s2">physical project to answer some</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.940" end="00:21:04.870" style="s2">questions and experimental set set up so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.789" end="00:21:10.120" style="s2">we have a project stream now the project</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:12.700" style="s2">stream one of the skills that you need</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.120" end="00:21:15.370" style="s2">to cultivate to support a project stream</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.700" end="00:21:19.690" style="s2">is embodied leadership because with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.370" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">project you have to start to access and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.690" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">gather resources and you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:28.629" style="s2">do that by just having contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:30.250" style="s2">insight you need some embodied</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.629" end="00:21:32.590" style="s2">leadership you need to go out in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.250" end="00:21:35.049" style="s2">world and interview people you need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.590" end="00:21:38.279" style="s2">go out into the world and get resources</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.049" end="00:21:43.149" style="s2">for your experiment or your built</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.279" end="00:21:47.279" style="s2">project and that projects inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.149" end="00:21:51.000" style="s2">create a living center or a community of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.279" end="00:21:53.370" style="s2">practice so that this process during</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.000" end="00:21:56.160" style="s2">is the project embodied leadership in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.370" end="00:21:59.100" style="s2">the community the community that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.160" end="00:22:06.290" style="s2">leading in an embodied way in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.100" end="00:22:11.250" style="s2">achieve your project so those are quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.290" end="00:22:14.580" style="s2">academic and scientific and challenging</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.250" end="00:22:16.500" style="s2">in a cognitive intellectual way but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.580" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">third process term I think has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.500" end="00:22:21.180" style="s2">increasingly important and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">something that&#39;s left tradition left out</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.180" end="00:22:27.890" style="s2">of almost all educational design and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:33.480" style="s2">that is practice or practical or a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.890" end="00:22:35.400" style="s2">practicum so you can&#39;t just do a project</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.480" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">all of a sudden you&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.400" end="00:22:42.300" style="s2">once it just shows up now that&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:45.060" style="s2">institutional situations where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.300" end="00:22:47.970" style="s2">institution will throw resources and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.060" end="00:22:52.260" style="s2">support and really do all the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.970" end="00:22:54.510" style="s2">you can give the student the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.260" end="00:22:58.440" style="s2">or at least the false sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.510" end="00:23:02.540" style="s2">project is being led by them but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.440" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">real way that research projects and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.540" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">action gets done in the world we know</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:10.980" style="s2">requires a lot of practice and when</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:14.100" style="s2">students are robbed of the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.980" end="00:23:17.040" style="s2">practice they are robbed of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.100" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">opportunity to develop the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.040" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">that they need to face an unknown future</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:29.070" style="s2">so practice I&#39;ve underneath practice I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.340" end="00:23:30.900" style="s2">put echo awareness and certainly here at</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.070" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">all the Lord we mean ecological</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.900" end="00:23:38.130" style="s2">awareness because designing and doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:41.580" style="s2">practice in the in the new world has to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.130" end="00:23:45.240" style="s2">do with being ecologically aware but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.580" end="00:23:48.120" style="s2">also mean it in terms of systems view or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.240" end="00:23:51.270" style="s2">ecological systems view because if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.120" end="00:23:54.060" style="s2">have a systems view of your practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.270" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to inform better inform</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.060" end="00:24:00.090" style="s2">and better generate or engineer or</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">design your project so the practice is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.090" end="00:24:03.720" style="s2">of echo awareness and how things fit</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:07.650" style="s2">into this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.720" end="00:24:11.690" style="s2">system and to really bring that down</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.650" end="00:24:14.039" style="s2">into your life skills so that that being</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.690" end="00:24:16.380" style="s2">ecologically aware of the whole entire</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.039" end="00:24:19.650" style="s2">system both human and non-human as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.380" end="00:24:21.990" style="s2">practice and making that real right down</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.650" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">in terms of your life school skills is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.990" end="00:24:30.419" style="s2">the practice that makes the project</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">practical so those are the three streams</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.419" end="00:24:40.350" style="s2">that are all the lower soul is built</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:44.179" style="s2">upon and these three are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.350" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">generating and self-organizing a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.179" end="00:24:54.030" style="s2">profound learning experience we can look</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:56.789" style="s2">at each one of these three streams in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.030" end="00:25:00.690" style="s2">different way so that for example this</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.789" end="00:25:04.409" style="s2">stream contemplative science being the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:08.390" style="s2">core which generates insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.409" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">research I put as a stream of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.390" end="00:25:16.010" style="s2">understanding so the goal of this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:20.100" style="s2">understanding in the skill or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.010" end="00:25:26.419" style="s2">competency that it intends is clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.100" end="00:25:30.900" style="s2">purpose so you can see how these all</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.419" end="00:25:37.049" style="s2">work to build more clarity of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.900" end="00:25:38.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s the stream of understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.049" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">what are some of the particulars in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.940" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">street clarity of purpose on deriving</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:50.520" style="s2">meaning being able to make these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:53.429" style="s2">more like core capacities being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.520" end="00:25:55.710" style="s2">derive meaning make important and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.429" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">relevant distinctions discovering</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.710" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">patterns and looking for innovation not</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">to just for Pete what&#39;s been done before</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.440" end="00:26:14.210" style="s2">in the project stream here we have at</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.730" end="00:26:17.269" style="s2">the core the community and it which</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.210" end="00:26:20.629" style="s2">requires the embodied leadership to</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.629" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">the leading stream to leave to be like a</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">this is cultivating is adequate</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.500" end="00:26:44.210" style="s2">insight into your research to really</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.809" end="00:26:47.240" style="s2">understand there&#39;s a certain level of</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:52.909" style="s2">a real-life project enough leadership</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.970" end="00:26:57.649" style="s2">enough community adequate participation</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.909" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">in your project is the capacity that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.649" end="00:27:05.389" style="s2">being cultivated in that stream and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">we look at core skills the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.389" end="00:27:11.620" style="s2">its enactment skills the ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:16.220" style="s2">a vision and enact it in the real world</p>
