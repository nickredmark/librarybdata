<p begin="00:00:12.549" end="00:00:19.060" style="s2">joining me we stand to me in what feels</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.900" end="00:00:21.400" style="s2">like a clearing at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.060" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">collectively I&#39;ve heard it described</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.400" end="00:00:31.869" style="s2">also as an eye of the storm a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:35.110" style="s2">place wherein we&#39;re identity is less</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.869" end="00:00:38.230" style="s2">stable than previous and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.110" end="00:00:41.859" style="s2">that it would be quite a good thing if</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.230" end="00:00:43.780" style="s2">we managed to draw together what</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.859" end="00:00:45.789" style="s2">knowledge and understanding we do</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.780" end="00:00:51.639" style="s2">collectively possess into something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.789" end="00:00:54.339" style="s2">was Integris and available for</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.639" end="00:00:56.170" style="s2">participation in for as many people as</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.339" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">possible and there&#39;s a sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.170" end="00:01:05.470" style="s2">imagistic element to all of this for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:09.430" style="s2">a friend of mine mentioned in an audio</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.470" end="00:01:12.310" style="s2">message that he was interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.430" end="00:01:14.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t an arc look like in this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.310" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">the development of an arc given this</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.320" end="00:01:20.530" style="s2">sort of swirling maelstrom of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:22.270" style="s2">possibility around us and I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.000" end="00:01:34.750" style="s2">deeply close to my heart and interest we</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.429" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">might present some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.750" end="00:01:42.250" style="s2">valuable educational but also take on</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">some questions that might emerge between</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.250" end="00:01:48.369" style="s2">us I certainly am resonating with a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:51.939" style="s2">relate to the nature of the self and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.369" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">ego and transformation and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.939" end="00:01:59.679" style="s2">come to know ourselves and each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">and the world in a way that is healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.679" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">you know how can we enter into</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:10.680" style="s2">relationships that don&#39;t inappropriately</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:11.870" style="s2">end our lives</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:51.620" style="s2">material that frankly doesn&#39;t often get</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.430" end="00:03:53.750" style="s2">a lot of attention in my experience at</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.620" end="00:03:56.810" style="s2">the University and I think can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.750" end="00:03:59.419" style="s2">treated with you know with and with an</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.810" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">academic eye that maintains openness but</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.419" end="00:04:04.370" style="s2">nevertheless you know subjects things to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:05.780" style="s2">the kind of standards that we expect in</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">this this whole scene which has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.220" end="00:04:46.340" style="s2">amazing it&#39;s a swirling whirling-pool a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">dough like Wizard of Oz so I&#39;m sort of</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.780" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">sort of modes of expression and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.449" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">very exciting so I&#39;ve been doing lots of</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:12.740" style="s2">with depth psychology sprinkled all over</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah beautiful you know I hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.740" end="00:05:17.000" style="s2">throughout all of that if I was to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">put put it into a word and we were like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.000" end="00:05:21.530" style="s2">four hundred years ago it probably would</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:25.370" style="s2">just be wizard fundamentally but we did</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.530" end="00:05:29.180" style="s2">that that that is the goal and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.370" end="00:05:30.530" style="s2">actually it&#39;s funny I I was there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.180" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">story that I sometimes tell in my class</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.530" end="00:05:36.020" style="s2">I used to run a conference at U of T</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">which was a kind of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.020" end="00:05:40.610" style="s2">between the Jungian Society and the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">Buddhist psychology group and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.610" end="00:05:44.570" style="s2">pretty good we had at the time John for</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.860" end="00:05:47.750" style="s2">fakey spoke for us but often Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.570" end="00:05:49.430" style="s2">Peterson was a very frequent speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.750" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">sort of Watts around local rock stars in</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:55.430" style="s2">Toronto as it were and this being a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:56.539" style="s2">number of years ago but at one point we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.430" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">were driving one of our Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.539" end="00:06:01.550" style="s2">speakers back to the airport and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:03.740" style="s2">in a car of course full of Buddhists and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:06.470" style="s2">I am I am NOT Buddhist although I you</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.740" end="00:06:07.820" style="s2">know respected borrow from Buddhism but</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.470" end="00:06:10.039" style="s2">there was sort of a big roundtable</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.820" end="00:06:11.419" style="s2">discussion that broke a round round car</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.039" end="00:06:13.789" style="s2">discussion when we were driving the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.419" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">airport about you know the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.789" end="00:06:18.530" style="s2">become a saint and you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.580" end="00:06:21.169" style="s2">this kind of like enlightenment emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.530" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">that that went around the car people</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.169" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">were like yeah you know when I got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:26.360" style="s2">Buddhism or I got into meditation I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:28.610" style="s2">really driven with this desire to attain</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.360" end="00:06:31.009" style="s2">a kind of sanctity of the Spirit and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.610" end="00:06:33.469" style="s2">sainthood and Buddhahood and right that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.009" end="00:06:35.180" style="s2">the Bodhisattva vow and it got around to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.469" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">me and I said well</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.180" end="00:06:38.389" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good goal don&#39;t get me</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">wrong but I have to admit that is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.389" end="00:06:42.740" style="s2">and has it that&#39;s never been my guiding</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:45.289" style="s2">ethos you know and they were like what</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:46.820" style="s2">do you mean I said I always would rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.289" end="00:06:49.970" style="s2">have been a wizard than a saint and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.820" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same thing they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.970" end="00:06:53.479" style="s2">the same thing they can both be bearers</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">of wisdom but they are subtly different</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.479" end="00:06:59.449" style="s2">figures with sort of different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:00.830" style="s2">cultural impact so being called dinkle</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.449" end="00:07:04.580" style="s2">the wizard is more or less I think the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.830" end="00:07:05.300" style="s2">highest compliment I could get beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.580" end="00:07:09.410" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.300" end="00:07:12.979" style="s2">yeah the union frame gives it opens a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.410" end="00:07:17.300" style="s2">world of archetypes obviously that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.979" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">have seen permeate throughout culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.300" end="00:07:24.620" style="s2">and popular culture in various ways and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:28.099" style="s2">continue to serve as important maps for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.620" end="00:07:32.780" style="s2">development for so many people yet the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.099" end="00:07:35.660" style="s2">sort of integration between a union</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.780" end="00:07:37.880" style="s2">frame and what are taken to be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.660" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">hallowed halls of knowledge in many of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.880" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">our universities today is is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:47.060" style="s2">fraught one right and well I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:51.070" style="s2">that in this conversation we might lay</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.060" end="00:07:54.320" style="s2">down a bit of a base track first of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.070" end="00:07:57.889" style="s2">sort of an explication an introduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.320" end="00:08:00.440" style="s2">that we can grapple onto for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.889" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">our discussion in pursuing some</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.440" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">questions so when people encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:11.630" style="s2">work of young at least in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:14.360" style="s2">the most nebulous initial concept which</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.630" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">is more than a concept in some important</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.360" end="00:08:19.970" style="s2">sense to get one&#39;s head and body and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:22.310" style="s2">heart sort of in and around is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.970" end="00:08:24.500" style="s2">notion of the archetypes I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.310" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">it&#39;s by any means the most nebulous but</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.500" end="00:08:35.000" style="s2">it is a sort of it&#39;s a early stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.159" end="00:08:39.169" style="s2">that yeah so how can we relate to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.000" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">notion of archetype what&#39;s a good sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.169" end="00:08:44.529" style="s2">of introduction point handle</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:47.900" style="s2">introduction point sure so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.529" end="00:08:49.070" style="s2">archetypes within young are in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.900" end="00:08:52.220" style="s2">the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.070" end="00:08:55.580" style="s2">organizing structures of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.220" end="00:08:57.050" style="s2">psyche okay so if you think about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.580" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">know Freud&#39;s model of the psyche which</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.050" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">everybody knows we have the super ego</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">and the ego and the it right and in many</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:05.540" style="s2">ways right this is a kind of hydraulic</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:08.030" style="s2">structure where the the super-ego right</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.540" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">your inner nag is operating on one side</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.030" end="00:09:12.260" style="s2">and the it&#39;d is attempting to drag you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:13.970" style="s2">from the other side and you&#39;re caught in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.260" end="00:09:16.340" style="s2">this kind of tug-of-war between them</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.970" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">where the ego is dragged back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.340" end="00:09:20.330" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hydraulic system with with</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">a few parts and it elaborates a bit over</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.330" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">time Yeol&#39;s model on the other hand is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:29.390" style="s2">very sort of multipolar or you know you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:32.300" style="s2">could think of it as being a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.390" end="00:09:33.980" style="s2">polytheistic so you know there are sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.300" end="00:09:37.430" style="s2">of multiple centers within the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:38.900" style="s2">that are operating and importantly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">this was part of where his big breakup</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.900" end="00:09:44.150" style="s2">from Freud happened you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:46.760" style="s2">all just sort of entrained to and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.150" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">dominated by the erotic drive so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.760" end="00:09:52.540" style="s2">not just all about sex or later sex and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:09:55.490" style="s2">death you know sort of late-stage Freud</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.540" end="00:09:57.590" style="s2">but rather there are a bunch of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.490" end="00:09:59.750" style="s2">centers within the psyche that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.590" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">structures that organize the way the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.750" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">people&#39;s minds work and above and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:06.500" style="s2">their sort of particular and individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:08.150" style="s2">you know constitution of their psyche</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.500" end="00:10:09.470" style="s2">they also organize the collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.150" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">unconscious which is also a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.470" end="00:10:14.660" style="s2">stumbling block for people so part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">the problem in thinking about these</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.660" end="00:10:20.870" style="s2">things is and one of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">often speak on is that Jung is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.870" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">writing his work and he was a quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:26.330" style="s2">prolific author but he&#39;s writing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.790" style="s2">working his theory over the span of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.330" end="00:10:30.920" style="s2">know 50 years so from sort of the teens</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.790" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">there to his death in the early sixties</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.920" end="00:10:36.440" style="s2">you know he has this volume of writings</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:38.660" style="s2">and necessarily his ideas about these</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.440" end="00:10:40.790" style="s2">things shift over that period right he</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.660" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">tends to favor a kind of completeness</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.790" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">over consistency and so you know he gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">these ships and so depending on where</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">you come in to the timeline on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:52.010" style="s2">of archetype you&#39;re going to get a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:54.380" style="s2">different sort of explanation of version</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.010" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">of the archetype now he is quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.380" end="00:10:59.540" style="s2">insistent that none of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:11:01.340" style="s2">descriptions lists or maps are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.540" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">the thing in itself right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.340" end="00:11:04.680" style="s2">important so the map isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:06.120" style="s2">territory we can talk about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.680" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">but at the end of the day it&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.120" end="00:11:10.710" style="s2">handles that we&#39;re using to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">understand something that in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.710" end="00:11:14.340" style="s2">fundamental sense is going to exceed</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:16.410" style="s2">whatever our description the model are</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.340" end="00:11:18.500" style="s2">so you can&#39;t just come up with this neat</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.410" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">list of archetypes right shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.500" end="00:11:23.520" style="s2">persona right that stuff it&#39;s handy but</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">ultimately speaking it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.520" end="00:11:27.900" style="s2">of a shorthand for what&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:30.930" style="s2">on but what is the archetype if I say an</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.900" end="00:11:32.430" style="s2">organizing principle so we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:33.810" style="s2">thinking about archetypes I think when</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">we encounter them casually in pop</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:39.900" style="s2">culture as being sort of the the core</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:42.600" style="s2">set of iconic figures that you might see</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.900" end="00:11:45.950" style="s2">in a myth or in a fairy tale so you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.600" end="00:11:49.260" style="s2">the king the dragon the warrior right</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.950" end="00:11:51.150" style="s2">you know the the damsel in distress to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.260" end="00:11:53.220" style="s2">some extent that&#39;s a way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.150" end="00:11:55.560" style="s2">them when we&#39;re thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.220" end="00:11:58.020" style="s2">collective unconscious but I think an</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.560" end="00:12:00.630" style="s2">easier way to get at these is just to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.020" end="00:12:02.610" style="s2">consider the kinds of shared psychic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.630" end="00:12:06.680" style="s2">structures that all of us invariably</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.610" end="00:12:10.260" style="s2">have so to give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.680" end="00:12:13.490" style="s2">necessarily because of biology everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.260" end="00:12:16.110" style="s2">alive on earth has a mother right</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.490" end="00:12:18.420" style="s2">automatically it&#39;s a given right they</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.110" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">may not know their mother but the point</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:21.480" style="s2">is right they are going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">relationship with the mother they will</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.480" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">have just stated inside of somebody as</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:27.060" style="s2">such right and mammals being what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:28.740" style="s2">are in humans in particular we have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.060" end="00:12:32.070" style="s2">really long developmental period right</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.740" end="00:12:34.260" style="s2">we have this bonding thing and so there</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.070" end="00:12:35.820" style="s2">is a natural kind of relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.260" end="00:12:36.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s formed with a mother or a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.820" end="00:12:39.540" style="s2">caretaker it can be a substitute</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.960" end="00:12:41.730" style="s2">caretaker but the point is right in sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.540" end="00:12:43.740" style="s2">of most involved standard conditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.730" end="00:12:45.780" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be this bonding event</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.740" end="00:12:48.200" style="s2">that occurs between a child and a mother</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.780" end="00:12:52.490" style="s2">right that is going to be pivotal to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.200" end="00:12:55.800" style="s2">child&#39;s sort of success and survival and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.490" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">so evolution in a sense if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.800" end="00:12:59.880" style="s2">think about this naturalistically</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:01.530" style="s2">preloads right the sort of infant</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.880" end="00:13:04.050" style="s2">version a little bit in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.530" end="00:13:07.800" style="s2">facilitate this so an example that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.050" end="00:13:09.300" style="s2">like to use here is geese so geese when</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.800" end="00:13:10.980" style="s2">they hatch out of an egg go through a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.300" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">phase called a short phase it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.980" end="00:13:15.000" style="s2">imprinting so what happens is you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">the egg cracks open and the little</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.000" end="00:13:19.149" style="s2">Gosling</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.769" style="s2">fixes its eyes on right whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.149" end="00:13:23.410" style="s2">nearby and and imprints on it as the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.769" end="00:13:25.000" style="s2">mother now 99% of the time of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.410" end="00:13:27.940" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be an adult goose that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.000" end="00:13:30.579" style="s2">is looking after the eggs and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.940" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">Gosling imprints on the goose and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.579" end="00:13:36.519" style="s2">it it behaves towards the goose in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:38.230" style="s2">ways that are adapted for it so if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.519" end="00:13:40.660" style="s2">goose walks on place right the Gosling&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.230" end="00:13:41.860" style="s2">were all talking along after it a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.660" end="00:13:45.820" style="s2">line and these are the behaviors that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.860" end="00:13:48.370" style="s2">were used to seeing in nature but if you</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.389" end="00:14:14.019" style="s2">time at the window and if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.220" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">you know take a ping-pong ball you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.019" end="00:14:18.010" style="s2">imprint the Gosling&#39;s and then you roll</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.010" end="00:14:22.750" style="s2">Gosling&#39;s will all toddle after it right</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.199" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">so they have a set of behaviors towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.750" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">the word right which is sort of in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:32.350" style="s2">sense kind of pre-built in to them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:34.990" style="s2">they have a kind of time-sensitive you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.350" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">know hole in their psyche which is ready</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.990" end="00:14:38.500" style="s2">to receive material and then behave</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:40.899" style="s2">towards that material in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.500" end="00:14:44.139" style="s2">if you want to think about this in young</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.899" end="00:14:45.790" style="s2">in terms you know there there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.139" end="00:14:47.860" style="s2">three phases to an archetype so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.790" end="00:14:50.350" style="s2">archetype stands outside your knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.860" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">completely right it&#39;s it&#39;s the content</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.350" end="00:14:53.889" style="s2">thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:56.470" style="s2">so you can&#39;t ever get at the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.889" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of necessarily invisible to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.160" style="s2">you can only sense it by its effects so</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:01.449" style="s2">what you get is some layers get the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.160" end="00:15:03.910" style="s2">archetype which you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.449" end="00:15:06.220" style="s2">infer the existence of whatever you get</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.910" end="00:15:08.829" style="s2">the archetypal image which is typically</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.220" end="00:15:11.050" style="s2">the cultural material which which builds</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.829" end="00:15:12.550" style="s2">up in general around this whole and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.050" end="00:15:14.949" style="s2">you have people&#39;s particular material</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.550" end="00:15:17.019" style="s2">which we would call their complex so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.949" end="00:15:18.250" style="s2">everybody has complexes and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.019" end="00:15:20.740" style="s2">about somebody having an e to post</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.250" end="00:15:23.319" style="s2">complex or superiority complex or right</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.740" end="00:15:25.949" style="s2">and complex is the material that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.319" end="00:15:29.529" style="s2">people have specifically sort of in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.949" end="00:15:30.999" style="s2">archetypal gap right</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.529" end="00:15:33.610" style="s2">so you can think about it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.999" end="00:15:35.620" style="s2">most Gosling&#39;s are going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.610" end="00:15:38.110" style="s2">complex which is their mother their</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.620" end="00:15:39.790" style="s2">specific mother and you know most</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.110" end="00:15:41.829" style="s2">animals can have variations and their</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.790" end="00:15:43.329" style="s2">personality so the specifics of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.829" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">they end up with in their complex is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.329" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">going to be dependent on who they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">imprint on who the mother is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.559" style="s2">and I suppose if they have a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:52.870" style="s2">irritable doose mother and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.559" end="00:15:56.019" style="s2">have specific ideas about what how geese</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.870" end="00:15:57.999" style="s2">behaves and if they right end up with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.019" end="00:15:59.019" style="s2">really friendly goose mother I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.999" end="00:16:01.420" style="s2">know what the range is a personality</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.019" end="00:16:02.980" style="s2">Araki&#39;s but you know to end up with real</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.420" end="00:16:04.899" style="s2">mother goose then they&#39;re gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.980" end="00:16:07.149" style="s2">with right but if they end up and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.899" end="00:16:08.589" style="s2">printing on a ping-pong ball then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.149" end="00:16:11.350" style="s2">material that they have is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.589" end="00:16:13.059" style="s2">problematic for them probably in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.350" end="00:16:15.639" style="s2">way or another right it&#39;s going to cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.059" end="00:16:17.850" style="s2">them issues because the information that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.639" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">they&#39;re then taking through this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.850" end="00:16:22.629" style="s2">this prime system ready to receive</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">information about the world is going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.629" end="00:16:26.529" style="s2">be sort of mucked up with a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:30.220" style="s2">inappropriate set of contents or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.529" end="00:16:33.029" style="s2">problematic set of contents humans have</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.220" end="00:16:33.029" style="s2">this stuff too right</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.730" end="00:16:38.529" style="s2">but we have it too so we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.709" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">yes we have sort of you know slots where</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.529" end="00:16:43.419" style="s2">mother and father go or you know primary</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:45.579" style="s2">caregivers we have the slots where our</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.419" end="00:16:48.429" style="s2">early romantic interest start to slot in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.579" end="00:16:50.410" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not uncommon to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.429" end="00:16:52.540" style="s2">people clinically and personally where</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.410" end="00:16:54.129" style="s2">they will tell you that you know their</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.540" end="00:16:55.509" style="s2">romantic interests have heavily</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.129" end="00:16:58.619" style="s2">patterned after somebody they had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.509" end="00:17:00.850" style="s2">crush on when they were 11 right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.619" end="00:17:03.399" style="s2">siblings will tend to imprint this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.850" end="00:17:06.459" style="s2">material and then we also develop both</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.399" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">sort of culturally relevant but also</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.459" end="00:17:11.500" style="s2">family culture and personally relevant</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:15.220" style="s2">images around all of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.500" end="00:17:18.069" style="s2">that are you know human universals every</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.220" end="00:17:20.339" style="s2">human culture has a concept of war right</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.069" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">a concept of war and so the warrior is</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.339" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">sort of a universal type among humans</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:27.970" style="s2">there are no human groups on earth that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:30.159" style="s2">don&#39;t have some idea of you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.970" end="00:17:31.690" style="s2">wise woman or the wise man right</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.159" end="00:17:33.970" style="s2">somebody who has sort of special</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.690" end="00:17:36.250" style="s2">knowledge in some sense humans</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.970" end="00:17:38.049" style="s2">universally have certain kinds of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.250" end="00:17:40.899" style="s2">know sort of spiritual ideas right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.049" end="00:17:42.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a cultural universal culture so far</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.899" end="00:17:44.950" style="s2">as I know it&#39;s a cultural universal that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.700" end="00:17:46.990" style="s2">up is associated with good and to down</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.950" end="00:17:48.850" style="s2">is associated with that and you find</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.990" end="00:17:50.139" style="s2">that everywhere and you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.850" end="00:17:51.970" style="s2">think about this and think there are all</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.139" end="00:17:53.590" style="s2">sorts of reasons why those associations</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.970" end="00:17:57.220" style="s2">in play and their genetic and their</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:17:58.779" style="s2">functional and right some of them are an</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.220" end="00:18:02.289" style="s2">outgrowth of culture but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.779" end="00:18:03.820" style="s2">that these patterns in our thinking are</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.289" end="00:18:08.610" style="s2">sort of universal and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.820" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">programmed in right you can also look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.610" end="00:18:15.490" style="s2">for instance cases where human infants</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">have responses to certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.490" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">patterns for things that they have not</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">actually income</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:24.230" style="s2">once it&#39;s it&#39;s there has been a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:26.810" style="s2">experimental work that shows that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.230" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">infants will fear show a fear response</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.810" end="00:18:32.070" style="s2">to the patterns of a spider or a snake</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">even if they have never mounted a spider</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.070" end="00:18:37.710" style="s2">or snake so on one level you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:39.750" style="s2">provided that sort of finding holds up</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.710" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">you can say well that makes sense right</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.750" end="00:18:44.010" style="s2">evolution probably predisposed babies</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:45.750" style="s2">not to reach for spiders right when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.010" end="00:18:51.000" style="s2">were you know coming up in during the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.750" end="00:18:52.650" style="s2">evolutionary sort of arc but above and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.000" end="00:18:54.870" style="s2">beyond that what it means is that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.650" end="00:18:56.490" style="s2">can imagine how that filters down what</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.870" end="00:18:57.930" style="s2">it means then in turn is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.490" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">going to pick up all this additional</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.930" end="00:19:03.270" style="s2">cultural material if you have something</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:04.830" style="s2">that is a fearful concept and and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.270" end="00:19:07.650" style="s2">human Universal you&#39;re gonna get all</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.830" end="00:19:10.950" style="s2">kinds of additional symbolism and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.650" end="00:19:14.220" style="s2">building up from it right so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.950" end="00:19:16.380" style="s2">of the that&#39;s the gist of it there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.220" end="00:19:19.110" style="s2">some other archetypes within the system</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.380" end="00:19:21.540" style="s2">but I suppose the shorthand way to think</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.110" end="00:19:23.610" style="s2">about it is this and this is sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.540" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">think the central insight of most of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.610" end="00:19:31.500" style="s2">psychodynamic systems from Freud onwards</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:34.440" style="s2">you&#39;re not one thing you&#39;re a dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.440" end="00:19:38.970" style="s2">parts are not I&#39;m sort of contra Freud</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.050" end="00:19:41.400" style="s2">those parts are not mechanical</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.690" end="00:20:01.890" style="s2">individual living things which exist in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.620" style="s2">a competitive structure resources and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.890" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">the fact is that you know yes we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.620" end="00:20:08.220" style="s2">this consciousness that we associate</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:11.190" style="s2">with sort of our whole body and whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.220" end="00:20:13.620" style="s2">brain that we call Anderson or Tim right</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.190" end="00:20:15.930" style="s2">but then the individual subsystems don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.620" end="00:20:18.870" style="s2">suddenly stop having any measure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.930" end="00:20:20.820" style="s2">agency consciousness or any of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.870" end="00:20:22.800" style="s2">other things just because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.820" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">slightly smaller in fact what you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.800" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">instead is a whole bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:29.670" style="s2">systems interacting together in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:31.380" style="s2">communal fashion to produce the psychic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.670" end="00:20:33.570" style="s2">thing that you typically apply the high</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.380" end="00:20:35.190" style="s2">level to that is you so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.570" end="00:20:37.500" style="s2">you have a bunch of these parts in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.190" end="00:20:38.520" style="s2">psyche and they sort of all answer to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.500" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">the same name and live at the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.520" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">address but that doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">mean that they&#39;re all communicating with</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:46.290" style="s2">each other and it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">mean that they all see things the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.290" end="00:20:50.850" style="s2">way or have the same goals beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:54.030" style="s2">does that does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.850" end="00:20:56.250" style="s2">very high level description yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.030" end="00:20:59.880" style="s2">yeah most certainly thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.250" end="00:21:04.200" style="s2">for laying that down so let&#39;s see how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.880" end="00:21:06.780" style="s2">take this on then you mentioned if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.200" end="00:21:08.280" style="s2">want to get really naturalistic about</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.780" end="00:21:10.440" style="s2">this or to speak from a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.280" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">naturalism and I am very much open to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.440" end="00:21:16.260" style="s2">the frame of naturalism but I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:22.140" style="s2">distinguished of course from</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.260" end="00:21:25.320" style="s2">supernaturalism so I I resonate with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.140" end="00:21:30.570" style="s2">kind of metaphysical naturalism in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.320" end="00:21:34.290" style="s2">I am NOT interested in kind of some</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.570" end="00:21:37.290" style="s2">black box that I am secretly hiding from</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.290" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">how we coherently seek to describe and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.290" end="00:21:42.600" style="s2">relate to our world as the thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.770" end="00:21:45.630" style="s2">reach for to then give that secret</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.600" end="00:21:50.730" style="s2">source of explanation or reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.630" end="00:21:54.030" style="s2">whole thing yet that that term I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.730" end="00:21:57.050" style="s2">often described in ways that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.030" end="00:22:01.110" style="s2">think can be at least at face value</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.050" end="00:22:04.560" style="s2">unhelpful for actually really feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.110" end="00:22:08.460" style="s2">into and integrating some of the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.560" end="00:22:11.490" style="s2">thinking that the union frame and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.460" end="00:22:14.820" style="s2">know concordant our chemical frames</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.490" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">might suggest we take seriously for</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.820" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">instance it can often be argued that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:24.930" style="s2">there the mind plays a reduced role in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">the naturalist framework you know some</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.930" end="00:22:30.300" style="s2">people sometimes define away the mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:31.730" style="s2">the existence of mind somehow in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.300" end="00:22:34.050" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.730" end="00:22:37.800" style="s2">before we even begin the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.050" end="00:22:39.870" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.800" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">this being caught between a rock and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.870" end="00:22:43.530" style="s2">hard place of kind of realism and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.880" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">idealism from a philosophy of mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.530" end="00:22:47.180" style="s2">perspective that I think people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">been perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.180" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">without the the toolkit to really look</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">to integrate some of the Jungian stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:58.040" style="s2">with a frame that&#39;s both palatable to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:01.310" style="s2">the West but that also speaks in a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.040" end="00:23:04.040" style="s2">that does a kind of feeling tone justice</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.310" end="00:23:08.450" style="s2">to the dynamics and qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.040" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">experience of our lives of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.450" end="00:23:13.610" style="s2">richness of the psyche and of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">mystery of meaning and and I hope we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.610" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">turn into these kind of domains now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">not seeking to sort of quibble about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">definitions of these kind of terms like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:26.930" style="s2">naturalism and what-have-you I I really</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:30.850" style="s2">am open to these things but the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.930" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">hey the patterns are where it&#39;s at and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.850" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">what strikes me is that just as there</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:37.970" style="s2">are kind of the metaphor that that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:41.330" style="s2">helpful is that just as there are organs</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.970" end="00:23:44.030" style="s2">of the body there are organs and of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.330" end="00:23:47.090" style="s2">psyche there are organs kind of like an</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.030" end="00:23:51.280" style="s2">inner organization of the psyche latent</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.090" end="00:23:53.780" style="s2">battles or patterns in potential that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.280" end="00:23:56.120" style="s2">realized themselves in accordance with</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.780" end="00:23:58.940" style="s2">what is presented in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.120" end="00:24:04.790" style="s2">so this imprinting and that also</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.940" end="00:24:08.120" style="s2">function together if they do so well in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.790" end="00:24:11.210" style="s2">a kind of developmental direction that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.120" end="00:24:16.060" style="s2">we can become more of who we are that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.210" end="00:24:19.820" style="s2">can realize ourselves by having or</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.060" end="00:24:23.030" style="s2">realizing how this inner what might</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.820" end="00:24:25.100" style="s2">begin as an inner potential or cacophony</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.030" end="00:24:26.840" style="s2">perhaps if we&#39;re not doing so well how</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.100" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">this can be brought into a kind of inner</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.840" end="00:24:31.220" style="s2">harmony how this community can realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:34.820" style="s2">itself in a kind of self making</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.220" end="00:24:37.700" style="s2">relationship and then of course well if</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.820" end="00:24:40.580" style="s2">there is a self like an inner harmony</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.700" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">within me and I realize myself in part</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.580" end="00:24:44.210" style="s2">through imprinting on things in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:45.980" style="s2">world and coming into relation with</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.210" end="00:24:48.950" style="s2">others then how do these patterns then</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.980" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">flow and work at a collective level and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.950" end="00:24:53.540" style="s2">then perhaps we get to a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:58.340" style="s2">grasp on what the collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.540" end="00:25:00.650" style="s2">unconsciously looks like but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.340" end="00:25:02.690" style="s2">a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.650" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">sort of baseline you&#39;ve laid down there</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.690" end="00:25:09.590" style="s2">now oh can I on the point of naturalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.100" end="00:25:11.330" style="s2">I actually should probably frame that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.590" end="00:25:14.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s I&#39;m so used to talking to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.330" end="00:25:16.190" style="s2">people who are all already operating</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.510" end="00:25:17.900" style="s2">sort of within this framework right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.190" end="00:25:19.160" style="s2">it&#39;s hard not to sometimes get a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.900" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">insular in the university environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.160" end="00:25:25.310" style="s2">but yeah so the question of naturalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.670" style="s2">when most people are thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.310" end="00:25:30.170" style="s2">naturalism just a reference I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.670" end="00:25:33.140" style="s2">people still have a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.170" end="00:25:36.200" style="s2">mechanistic hangover right so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.140" end="00:25:38.510" style="s2">like there&#39;s like a post-newtonian drag</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.200" end="00:25:40.820" style="s2">they sort of post-newtonian with a touch</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.510" end="00:25:43.280" style="s2">of the bleakest form of darwin that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.820" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">people have gotten I&#39;ve cottoned on -</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.280" end="00:25:47.720" style="s2">right and for we can come back around to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:49.610" style="s2">this I actually think that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.720" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">particular exceedingly bleak and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.610" end="00:25:54.800" style="s2">mechanistic view still has utility</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:58.370" style="s2">provided that you&#39;re not using by itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.800" end="00:26:01.670" style="s2">so the general position that I have is I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.370" end="00:26:03.710" style="s2">think that and this applies to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.670" end="00:26:07.640" style="s2">all you know knowledge creation and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.710" end="00:26:10.790" style="s2">try to apply it everywhere but I&#39;m as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.640" end="00:26:13.460" style="s2">militant agnostic and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.790" end="00:26:16.850" style="s2">particular kind of extreme emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.460" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">epistemological humility so I believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.850" end="00:26:22.670" style="s2">that certainty is that both the search</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:24.530" style="s2">for a certainty and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.670" end="00:26:26.810" style="s2">certainty are more often than not the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.530" end="00:26:30.050" style="s2">problem rather than the solution that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.810" end="00:26:33.620" style="s2">people think they are and also I have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.050" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">very strong maybe even a radical kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.620" end="00:26:40.580" style="s2">approach to maintaining flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:44.120" style="s2">one&#39;s models so I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.580" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">looking for the certain answer and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.120" end="00:26:49.010" style="s2">striving towards perfect consistency is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:50.390" style="s2">necessarily the best way to approach</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.010" end="00:26:52.900" style="s2">knowledge especially in these domains</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.390" end="00:26:56.300" style="s2">and so I take my notes from good ol</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.900" end="00:26:58.910" style="s2">tarski properly but and I favour</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.300" end="00:27:00.890" style="s2">completeness over consistency and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.910" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">idea is you can do that provided that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.890" end="00:27:05.630" style="s2">you aren&#39;t hung up on making everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:06.410" style="s2">lock together in a totally airtight way</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.630" end="00:27:08.030" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.410" end="00:27:09.950" style="s2">provided that you maintain a state of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.030" end="00:27:11.420" style="s2">play where you can adopt a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.950" end="00:27:12.920" style="s2">and play with it and see how it works</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.420" end="00:27:13.970" style="s2">and adopt another perspective and play</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.920" end="00:27:16.399" style="s2">with it and she</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.970" end="00:27:18.259" style="s2">around you can shape-shift essentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.399" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">speaking if you can shape-shift you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.259" end="00:27:22.279" style="s2">actually do quite a bit so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.620" style="s2">first thing the reason I bring up that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.279" end="00:27:28.039" style="s2">that sort of the naturalistic point is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.620" end="00:27:30.409" style="s2">do believe in in the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.039" end="00:27:32.059" style="s2">naturalism I think that you know finding</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.409" end="00:27:34.909" style="s2">sort of formal scientific things is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.059" end="00:27:38.419" style="s2">really powerful tool to get acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.909" end="00:27:41.330" style="s2">albeit not the only one but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.419" end="00:27:43.789" style="s2">that that Newtonian hangover I mean okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.330" end="00:27:45.799" style="s2">I remember being at the pub this was</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.789" end="00:27:46.970" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t know 10 years ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.799" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">was waiting for somebody and I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.970" end="00:27:50.570" style="s2">having two or three pints and two or</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.490" end="00:27:52.549" style="s2">three pints and I&#39;m listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.570" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">conversation behind me and I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.549" end="00:27:57.799" style="s2">to a very well-meaning but extremely</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:28:00.470" style="s2">earnest young man sort of hold forth</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.799" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">about how science was draining all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.470" end="00:28:04.309" style="s2">mystery and magic from the world right</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">it was this this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.309" end="00:28:07.850" style="s2">disenchantment hypothesis I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">to this and i&#39;ma listen to this and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.850" end="00:28:14.059" style="s2">quit but I&#39;m thinking wrong really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.919" style="s2">in my opinion right or in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.059" end="00:28:18.860" style="s2">and so finally I turned around and said</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.919" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">like why are you talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.860" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">science does not make the world a pinned</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">down well established solid place it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">makes the world radically more bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">into mysterious everything science</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:35.779" style="s2">touches gets weirder and and in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:38.690" style="s2">experience more wonderful right and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.779" end="00:28:41.809" style="s2">and if you get into the habit of talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.690" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">to people in scientific fields the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.809" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">question I was like to go for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.100" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">straightaway is like what in the field</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">is unsolved and does it make sense where</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:49.759" style="s2">are the deep mysteries and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">always there and every field people</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.759" end="00:28:56.149" style="s2">whilst we have no idea how anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:58.190" style="s2">works right to me I mean you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.149" end="00:29:01.820" style="s2">wonderful right it&#39;s like so much open</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.190" end="00:29:03.379" style="s2">grounds for exploration but but there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.820" end="00:29:05.090" style="s2">to this idea of a certain amount of sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.379" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">of mechanism in science that people get</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.090" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">hung up on that&#39;s I think we&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.970" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">current generation of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:15.379" style="s2">really excels that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:18.139" style="s2">bridging language to start to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.379" end="00:29:20.539" style="s2">of this more esoteric material back into</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.139" end="00:29:24.019" style="s2">dialogue so that it&#39;s not sort of off in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.539" end="00:29:26.360" style="s2">a off in a weird you know corner by</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.019" end="00:29:27.380" style="s2">itself right being shunned by the rest</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.360" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.380" end="00:29:31.309" style="s2">so for instance you said for instance we</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.260" style="s2">can think about the archetypes as being</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.309" end="00:29:33.950" style="s2">like organs right mm-hmm and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.260" end="00:29:36.950" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.950" end="00:29:38.090" style="s2">but the trick is if it&#39;s naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.950" end="00:29:40.400" style="s2">and if you think that this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.090" end="00:29:42.590" style="s2">mostly occurring from the brain then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.400" end="00:29:45.020" style="s2">brain is this amazing little machine</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.590" end="00:29:47.270" style="s2">that it turns out is a machine made of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.020" end="00:29:51.140" style="s2">other machines that can turn itself into</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.270" end="00:29:53.690" style="s2">new machines right and so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.140" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">a set of organs it&#39;s a set of evolving</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.690" end="00:29:57.830" style="s2">organs with relationships to each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:00.260" style="s2">that are shifting around so like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.830" end="00:30:01.970" style="s2">sometimes into my students people solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.260" end="00:30:04.370" style="s2">this idea that the brain is like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.970" end="00:30:05.990" style="s2">know a mass of wires and circuits and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:08.510" style="s2">you cut into it it&#39;ll spark and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.990" end="00:30:10.010" style="s2">much more like a bucket of worms right</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.510" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">the neurons are squirming around in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.010" end="00:30:13.700" style="s2">there and replicating and connecting and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:15.950" style="s2">like it&#39;s a much more organic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.700" end="00:30:17.809" style="s2">thing and as cognitive science has</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.950" end="00:30:19.280" style="s2">incorporated things like dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.809" end="00:30:21.500" style="s2">systems theory and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.280" end="00:30:23.900" style="s2">right and and adopted these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.500" end="00:30:26.440" style="s2">neuroplasticity we start to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:28.760" style="s2">much more living and far more</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.440" end="00:30:32.600" style="s2">philosophically kind of expansive and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.760" end="00:30:34.309" style="s2">and deeply mysterious ground through</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.600" end="00:30:35.690" style="s2">which we can start to explore this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.309" end="00:30:37.220" style="s2">but without sort of breaking the rules</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.690" end="00:30:39.890" style="s2">if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.220" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">no absolutely and I&#39;m you know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.890" end="00:30:44.090" style="s2">resonate with that very strongly and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:49.940" style="s2">glad we we make this we can gladly make</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.090" end="00:30:53.900" style="s2">this link so you know I&#39;m the worst at</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.940" end="00:30:55.669" style="s2">this because I start by victory so can I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.900" end="00:30:58.429" style="s2">ask you a question I&#39;m cause I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.669" end="00:31:00.890" style="s2">so how did you come by like where does</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.429" end="00:31:02.059" style="s2">your interest in young and deaf psyche</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.890" end="00:31:06.140" style="s2">and alchemy where does all that emerge</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.059" end="00:31:09.710" style="s2">from who often in those questions I go</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.140" end="00:31:12.049" style="s2">quite developmental but let&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.710" end="00:31:16.760" style="s2">fine everything&#39;s development inherently</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.049" end="00:31:18.860" style="s2">development well yeah my experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.760" end="00:31:21.559" style="s2">currently is there&#39;s about 20 things</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.860" end="00:31:25.460" style="s2">that I feel I wish to kind of Orient and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.559" end="00:31:27.799" style="s2">limbs and bring together and seek to lay</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.460" end="00:31:31.549" style="s2">some ground for really ripe inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.799" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">I&#39;m also partly I sort of want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.549" end="00:31:36.770" style="s2">apologize to any audience members who</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.870" style="s2">might be looking for something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.770" end="00:31:40.400" style="s2">more of a formal introduction to some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.870" end="00:31:41.149" style="s2">these concepts I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.400" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2">to be able to contain</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.149" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">myself and I kind of just want to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.580" end="00:31:48.379" style="s2">right in there because um okay so why</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">okay you&#39;re gonna leave them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.379" end="00:31:51.619" style="s2">gonna leave delicious I&#39;ll work on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:53.450" style="s2">table you want to go find stuff at</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.619" end="00:31:55.849" style="s2">anyway but if it&#39;s all if that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.450" end="00:32:07.009" style="s2">implication that can be fun too anyway</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.849" end="00:32:11.989" style="s2">okay sorry okay okay so who the you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.009" end="00:32:14.469" style="s2">a long story very short was the breakup</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.989" end="00:32:17.029" style="s2">of the world parents let&#39;s say a divorce</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.469" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">my parents divorce and moving from</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.029" end="00:32:23.659" style="s2">England to Australia very much a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:25.580" style="s2">Garden of Eden type environment where I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.659" end="00:32:29.389" style="s2">was afforded such wonderful educational</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:32.029" style="s2">opportunities until I was about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.389" end="00:32:33.469" style="s2">you know ten and a half eleven and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.029" end="00:32:36.769" style="s2">last few years in England were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.469" end="00:32:38.599" style="s2">pretty rough years yeah and moving to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.769" end="00:32:41.479" style="s2">Australia and having a very opposite</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.599" end="00:32:43.429" style="s2">experience in terms of schooling so and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.479" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">by the time high school sort of ended I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.429" end="00:32:50.029" style="s2">didn&#39;t attend a bunch of my final exams</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:54.639" style="s2">and was altogether completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.029" end="00:32:56.839" style="s2">disillusioned by life fundamentally then</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.639" end="00:32:58.249" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m a high school dropout so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.839" end="00:33:02.359" style="s2">totally hear you yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.249" end="00:33:04.909" style="s2">beautiful you know so disillusioned with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.359" end="00:33:08.599" style="s2">with teacherly Authority fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.909" end="00:33:12.289" style="s2">but having this kind of sort of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.599" end="00:33:14.989" style="s2">embodied sense of there being other</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.289" end="00:33:17.749" style="s2">possibilities and a deep recess of love</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.989" end="00:33:20.049" style="s2">there that was that was broken and hurt</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.749" end="00:33:22.489" style="s2">but it was a sort of a driving force</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.049" end="00:33:24.379" style="s2">which which is important because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.489" end="00:33:25.849" style="s2">gonna skip a bunch of years now and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.379" end="00:33:27.469" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna skip into a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.849" end="00:33:29.779" style="s2">powerful psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.469" end="00:33:32.809" style="s2">mm-hm you know I had already cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.779" end="00:33:34.580" style="s2">an interest in philosophy and fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.809" end="00:33:37.339" style="s2">and you know what have you and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.580" end="00:33:38.869" style="s2">travelled a bit and had been practicing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.339" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">meditation had other psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.869" end="00:33:49.969" style="s2">experiences but this particular one you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:53.059" style="s2">know was a real climactic wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.969" end="00:33:54.620" style="s2">break but one mode of response would be</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.620" end="00:34:03.559" style="s2">and the the experience was one that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:05.690" style="s2">spent many years sort of writing about</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.559" end="00:34:08.659" style="s2">privately and seeking to sort of mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.690" end="00:34:13.610" style="s2">the gold from and I feel it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.659" end="00:34:17.899" style="s2">relevant because I was sort of taken</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.610" end="00:34:21.700" style="s2">into a what feels like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.899" end="00:34:25.310" style="s2">timeless domain where the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.700" end="00:34:30.169" style="s2">opportunity or spiral or circle or</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.310" end="00:34:34.659" style="s2">recursion was presented to me and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.169" end="00:34:39.260" style="s2">know it was like a hyper meditation on</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.659" end="00:34:42.350" style="s2">the fundamental modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.260" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">available in consciousness in response</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.350" end="00:34:50.230" style="s2">to what was overwhelming appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:53.990" style="s2">absolute chaos just that a maelstrom of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.230" end="00:34:56.389" style="s2">dissolution that a deep part of me was</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.990" end="00:35:01.670" style="s2">seeking to hold off and resist and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.389" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">reject and one feels very quickly as one</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.670" end="00:35:09.140" style="s2">Orient&#39;s in relation to this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:11.890" style="s2">whether accepting it or rejecting it or</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.140" end="00:35:15.890" style="s2">what the effect of that kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.890" end="00:35:19.180" style="s2">there can be a relief and there can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.890" end="00:35:22.850" style="s2">you know a deep kind of existential pain</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.180" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">so so skipping ahead from that a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.850" end="00:35:29.150" style="s2">appear I had become interested in young</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:31.310" style="s2">through interests in what meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.150" end="00:35:34.040" style="s2">fundamentally you know as a response to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.310" end="00:35:36.500" style="s2">a sort of depression and many elements</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.040" end="00:35:38.890" style="s2">of the meaning crisis trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.500" end="00:35:41.120" style="s2">people to talk to to learn from like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.890" end="00:35:43.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something else it&#39;s being missed</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.120" end="00:35:45.260" style="s2">here by a particularly kind of reductive</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.190" end="00:35:47.720" style="s2">approach to to either doing philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:50.450" style="s2">or relating to the world that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.720" end="00:35:53.300" style="s2">something about the orientation that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.450" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">quality of my experience itself like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.300" end="00:35:58.820" style="s2">the the beauty in expression itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:36:00.950" style="s2">being on the pulse of that that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.820" end="00:36:04.280" style="s2">an inherent &#39;no stew the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.950" end="00:36:06.650" style="s2">being that I was not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.280" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">forestall I didn&#39;t want to cut that away</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.650" end="00:36:10.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:12.430" style="s2">like an integration with a understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.840" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">of reality itself so you might think</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.430" end="00:36:19.390" style="s2">like how fundamental are we are our</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:21.730" style="s2">experiences to the universe like how</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.390" end="00:36:22.930" style="s2">much do we matter really because some</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.730" end="00:36:25.300" style="s2">views are like our we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.930" end="00:36:26.830" style="s2">just contingent on sort of like a base</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.300" end="00:36:28.840" style="s2">alloy if we think in mechanistically</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.830" end="00:36:30.369" style="s2">it&#39;s like well one thing kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.840" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">know all of a sudden something pops up</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.369" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">at another level and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:37.450" style="s2">consciousness we experience is just kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">of contingent on stuff that&#39;s holy</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.450" end="00:36:41.380" style="s2">maybe non conscious this was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:42.910" style="s2">language I used at the time and this was</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.380" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">kind of deeply dissatisfying because</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.910" end="00:36:46.180" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like oh well so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:47.710" style="s2">whole bunch of determined kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.180" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">patterns or they&#39;re indeterminate or</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.710" end="00:36:51.940" style="s2">whatever but what&#39;s happening up here is</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:54.070" style="s2">kind of it is one of whatever right like</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.940" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a but it&#39;s a bunch of Eddie&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.070" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">some hydrogen atoms are having on their</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:01.720" style="s2">way to heat death right exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:05.619" style="s2">sure Anna and I was not too pleased with</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.720" end="00:37:07.300" style="s2">this as I think many people are so so</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.619" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">I&#39;m not pleased with but you know you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.300" end="00:37:10.990" style="s2">can take different different views on</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.730" style="s2">things and this was you know is still at</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.990" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">a kind of historical point in time where</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.730" end="00:37:19.210" style="s2">I was searching for you know more fuller</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">perspectives and and I remain deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.210" end="00:37:25.470" style="s2">deeply interested in how it is we can in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:27.700" style="s2">fact realize ourselves become who we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.470" end="00:37:29.380" style="s2">realize what is ours to do in</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.700" end="00:37:34.200" style="s2">relationship with each other in such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.380" end="00:37:36.550" style="s2">way that involves us deeply in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.200" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">emergence in the creation in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.550" end="00:37:42.550" style="s2">co-creation of reality of being now how</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">we want to technically make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.550" end="00:37:48.010" style="s2">that is a beautiful inquiry that we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:52.359" style="s2">well have but why am i interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.010" end="00:37:58.510" style="s2">this stuff because god damn that seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.359" end="00:38:01.540" style="s2">like a pretty good reason yeah wanting</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.510" end="00:38:03.099" style="s2">wanting to escape existential entropy in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.540" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">favor of co-creating the universe seems</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.099" end="00:38:06.849" style="s2">like a pretty good reason yeah yeah do</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:11.260" style="s2">something with your time right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.849" end="00:38:13.210" style="s2">exactly exactly yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.260" end="00:38:15.070" style="s2">interesting I there are a bunch of touch</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.210" end="00:38:18.670" style="s2">points for that my parents are likewise</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.070" end="00:38:21.490" style="s2">divorce although in a very a and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.670" end="00:38:22.990" style="s2">typically amicable fashion I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.490" end="00:38:25.089" style="s2">which has its own drawbacks because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.990" end="00:38:27.790" style="s2">gave me unusual ideas about how amico</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.089" end="00:38:33.309" style="s2">brick how amicable breakups are and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.790" end="00:38:34.930" style="s2">should be but but likewise you know is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.309" end="00:38:36.190" style="s2">it am I allowed to ask what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.930" end="00:38:37.930" style="s2">psychedelic in question was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.190" end="00:38:39.220" style="s2">experience that you have this was</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.930" end="00:38:42.309" style="s2">psilocybin it&#39;s about five and a half</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.220" end="00:38:44.140" style="s2">grams of evoke even to the heroic heroic</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.309" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">dose so you shot yourself as a cannon I</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.140" end="00:38:51.490" style="s2">did indeed yeah I mean it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.500" style="s2">on that on that front alone just not</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.490" end="00:38:55.660" style="s2">even getting to the the depth psyche</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.500" end="00:38:58.510" style="s2">thing it&#39;s as I&#39;ve said it I&#39;ve spoken</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.660" end="00:39:01.990" style="s2">on psychedelics at quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.510" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">conferences and talks and things and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.990" end="00:39:04.900" style="s2">know when I was sort of first interested</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:08.260" style="s2">in doing stuff around this at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.900" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">university I got no no no no you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.260" end="00:39:12.040" style="s2">destroy your career right</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">and I grew up reading you know Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.040" end="00:39:15.880" style="s2">Leary and these people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">Scientific American that was all</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.880" end="00:39:21.579" style="s2">starry-eyed reading accounts of Albert</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:23.619" style="s2">Hoffman and stuff and everyone was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.579" end="00:39:25.869" style="s2">you can&#39;t touch this and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.619" end="00:39:28.180" style="s2">there was a short period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.869" end="00:39:29.710" style="s2">suddenly I started to find the you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.180" end="00:39:32.650" style="s2">the psychedelic Renaissance picking up</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.710" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">steam and as I said maybe first about</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.650" end="00:39:35.799" style="s2">five years ago the thing that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:38.049" style="s2">jarring again is it&#39;s wonderful to see</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.799" end="00:39:40.540" style="s2">so much good new work being done right</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.049" end="00:39:42.069" style="s2">but it&#39;s weird for me because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.540" end="00:39:47.530" style="s2">used to being on the winning side of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.069" end="00:39:49.000" style="s2">cultural argument range to now have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.530" end="00:39:52.450" style="s2">positions that were considered quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.000" end="00:39:54.210" style="s2">cranky ten or fifteen years ago but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.450" end="00:39:56.260" style="s2">know it seems like there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.210" end="00:39:57.849" style="s2">cultural receptivity and there always</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.260" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">was right at the fringe on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.849" end="00:40:01.299" style="s2">underground and the progressive edge</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:03.670" style="s2">people always recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.299" end="00:40:06.220" style="s2">psychedelic experiences could be these</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.670" end="00:40:08.290" style="s2">pivotal breakthrough moments that really</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.220" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">altered your sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.290" end="00:40:11.740" style="s2">yourself and what the potentials of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:14.049" style="s2">those things could be like that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.740" end="00:40:15.940" style="s2">that&#39;s why kids continue to drop</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.049" end="00:40:18.130" style="s2">mushrooms from time out of mind like</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.940" end="00:40:20.260" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re kind of fun at a party but</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.130" end="00:40:22.059" style="s2">that&#39;s not really what&#39;s happening most</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.260" end="00:40:24.609" style="s2">of the time because equally they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.059" end="00:40:26.680" style="s2">sometimes not that fun to party and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.609" end="00:40:28.329" style="s2">instead you you know whatever have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.680" end="00:40:31.869" style="s2">make confrontation with universe</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.329" end="00:40:34.540" style="s2">devouring Kelly or something yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.869" end="00:40:35.350" style="s2">like so why have those remains currents</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.540" end="00:40:36.580" style="s2">and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.350" end="00:40:39.700" style="s2">yeah you really put your finger on it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.580" end="00:40:41.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about opening up this access</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.700" end="00:40:43.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t himself was anti psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.470" end="00:40:44.650" style="s2">which is actually one of the points</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.030" end="00:40:48.220" style="s2">where he and I diverge I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.650" end="00:40:50.110" style="s2">that&#39;s a remarkably culturally blinkered</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.220" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">kind of view given everything we know</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.110" end="00:40:55.420" style="s2">but the anthropological role of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:57.640" style="s2">things but I can understand why he he</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.420" end="00:40:59.500" style="s2">was wary of them right because coming up</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.640" end="00:41:01.390" style="s2">in the in the 50s during the early</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.500" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">sixties you know this is the period</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.390" end="00:41:06.730" style="s2">right before Tim Leary becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">completely unhinged and God bless Leary</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.730" end="00:41:09.790" style="s2">he was very handsome and he did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:11.560" style="s2">good promotion but ultimately speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.790" end="00:41:14.560" style="s2">he&#39;s the one that got Nixon to clamp</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.560" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">down on everything and really gave that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.560" end="00:41:25.330" style="s2">kind of an out of control vibe yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:26.920" style="s2">the experience that you detail I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.330" end="00:41:28.570" style="s2">does it sounds really familiar to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.920" end="00:41:30.730" style="s2">likewise right there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.570" end="00:41:32.650" style="s2">disenchantment and I was a high school</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.730" end="00:41:34.990" style="s2">dropout for a reason like I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.650" end="00:41:38.380" style="s2">nothing to do with official instructors</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.990" end="00:41:40.090" style="s2">for a long time and it took me a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.380" end="00:41:41.530" style="s2">time to come back around to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.090" end="00:41:44.460" style="s2">that there was something to be done</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.530" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">there and that actually the system was</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.460" end="00:41:49.900" style="s2">shockingly more receptive to my weird</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.020" end="00:41:51.490" style="s2">ideas than I thought it would be and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.900" end="00:41:52.990" style="s2">give me more degrees of freedom than I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.490" end="00:41:54.790" style="s2">expected so I have to say actually the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.990" end="00:41:57.160" style="s2">University of them quite kind to me not</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.790" end="00:41:57.640" style="s2">that I have no beefs with them of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.160" end="00:41:58.600" style="s2">I do</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.640" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">and I think that there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.600" end="00:42:03.940" style="s2">they do that are silly and need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:05.710" style="s2">overhauled but um but on the main point</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.940" end="00:42:07.390" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting at I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.710" end="00:42:10.620" style="s2">actually speaks to what I think is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.390" end="00:42:13.060" style="s2">kind of one of the central pillars in</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.620" end="00:42:15.460" style="s2">Jungian work right and trying to do the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.060" end="00:42:17.470" style="s2">work so people talk a lot about like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.460" end="00:42:20.080" style="s2">three stages if you mean work right</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.470" end="00:42:22.420" style="s2">loosely construed so you get like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.080" end="00:42:24.190" style="s2">shadow stage and so that&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.420" end="00:42:26.950" style="s2">grappling with your shadow material</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:28.380" style="s2">right and then you get a slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.950" end="00:42:32.140" style="s2">difficult stage where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.380" end="00:42:33.580" style="s2">encountering your your enema or enema so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.140" end="00:42:35.500" style="s2">your days of basically dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.580" end="00:42:38.020" style="s2">issues of relationship right with other</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.500" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">people and specifically use sexual and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.020" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">romantic relationship but to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:44.230" style="s2">parental relationship and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:46.060" style="s2">this nebulous masterwork at the top</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.230" end="00:42:49.140" style="s2">which is the relationship between your</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.060" end="00:42:53.010" style="s2">ego your regular conscious self and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.140" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">less self and this causes a lot of horny</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.010" end="00:42:57.300" style="s2">confusion for people and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:43:01.530" style="s2">that you know we&#39;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.300" end="00:43:04.650" style="s2">encapsulate it but it&#39;s a very mystical</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.530" end="00:43:06.900" style="s2">space and that throws off relatively</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.650" end="00:43:09.000" style="s2">conventional psychology people are used</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.900" end="00:43:10.220" style="s2">to right because it&#39;s like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.000" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">dealing with here this sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.220" end="00:43:18.150" style="s2">schizophrenic psychosis right and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">throws off people who have a more</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.150" end="00:43:21.300" style="s2">naturalistic view because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:23.580" style="s2">essences right that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.300" end="00:43:25.500" style="s2">fundamental self smells a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.580" end="00:43:28.410" style="s2">like the eternal soul and some people</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.500" end="00:43:31.800" style="s2">get weirded out by that but I once said</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.410" end="00:43:33.690" style="s2">to a Freudian I had a Freudian professor</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.800" end="00:43:36.300" style="s2">in my undergrad who has since become a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.690" end="00:43:38.970" style="s2">friend and I went it was office hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.300" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">one time he was a Buddhist and in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.970" end="00:43:42.510" style="s2">clinical psychologist but also was</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">training as a Freudian and like</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.510" end="00:43:45.750" style="s2">old-school Freudian lying on the couch</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:47.730" style="s2">four days a week kind of right now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.750" end="00:43:53.610" style="s2">so I went it was office and I said I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.730" end="00:43:56.370" style="s2">gotta ask why Freud like wife boy like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.610" end="00:43:58.170" style="s2">was just so puzzled by Freud and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.370" end="00:43:59.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t know him that well then he was</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.170" end="00:44:02.310" style="s2">very deft and he turned it around he</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.640" end="00:44:04.740" style="s2">said well why young you knew I was young</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.310" end="00:44:06.660" style="s2">in and I was sort of thrown by that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.740" end="00:44:10.020" style="s2">the answer that I came up with on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.660" end="00:44:11.610" style="s2">spot remains I think in some ways you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.020" end="00:44:14.460" style="s2">know it was one of those answers that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.610" end="00:44:17.070" style="s2">came through me in a sense and I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.460" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">more that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.070" end="00:44:23.190" style="s2">or of the sort of original psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:27.060" style="s2">theorists yo understands the realities</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.190" end="00:44:28.620" style="s2">of the soul and when I say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.060" end="00:44:30.540" style="s2">sometimes it first people off because</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.620" end="00:44:32.940" style="s2">they think I mean something woowoo and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.540" end="00:44:34.920" style="s2">I&#39;m not ruling that out because you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.940" end="00:44:37.080" style="s2">Lord knows we flipped our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.920" end="00:44:39.330" style="s2">models into a relevancy every 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.080" end="00:44:40.950" style="s2">for the past 500 so let&#39;s not rule</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.330" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">anything out yet folks if you think we</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.950" end="00:44:45.960" style="s2">have our model of reality nailed down</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:47.610" style="s2">you&#39;re sorely wrong and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.960" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">all kinds of issues the very first piece</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.610" end="00:44:52.550" style="s2">of work to ever did the John&#39;s or fakey</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">work with was we co-authored a paper on</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.550" end="00:44:57.780" style="s2">our theory of consciousness and like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.730" style="s2">know there&#39;s a reason that the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.780" end="00:45:00.840" style="s2">consciousness proposed by the issues</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.730" end="00:45:02.310" style="s2">with the theories of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.840" end="00:45:05.310" style="s2">proposed by Chalmers are called the hard</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.310" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">problem it&#39;s like the hard problem you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.310" end="00:45:09.240" style="s2">know so there are some big gaps but when</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.550" style="s2">I say that you know understands the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.240" end="00:45:15.780" style="s2">reality is a soul what I mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.550" end="00:45:20.490" style="s2">he&#39;s a very careful and nuanced observer</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.780" end="00:45:22.470" style="s2">of the phenomenology of of being across</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.490" end="00:45:25.050" style="s2">sort of multiple dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.470" end="00:45:26.730" style="s2">consciousness so he&#39;s not just concerned</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.050" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">with regular everyday consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.730" end="00:45:31.320" style="s2">he&#39;s concerned with all these subtle</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:33.390" style="s2">strange events that happen at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.320" end="00:45:36.180" style="s2">of our usual consciousness or outside</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.390" end="00:45:39.360" style="s2">our usual consciousness but that gesture</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:45.360" style="s2">at some kind of deeper and larger</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.360" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">reality within the mind right and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.360" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">know when you&#39;re looking at the three</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:50.820" style="s2">levels and you&#39;re looking at sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:52.260" style="s2">shadow work and then a relationship work</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.820" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">in itself it&#39;s like well what are we</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.260" end="00:45:56.010" style="s2">talking about and the grand scheme of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">that whole thing I think is best</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.010" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">summarized by just saying that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:06.930" style="s2">the real goal of union work is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:10.830" style="s2">gradually get the ego to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.930" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not the center of the gel it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.830" end="00:46:14.220" style="s2">the center of it&#39;s just where</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:17.400" style="s2">consciousness is that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.220" end="00:46:19.500" style="s2">right so the ego can be kind of a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.400" end="00:46:21.270" style="s2">narcissistic tyrant it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.500" end="00:46:23.190" style="s2">assumption that it&#39;s sort of running</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.270" end="00:46:25.260" style="s2">everything because that&#39;s where you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.190" end="00:46:26.940" style="s2">see it&#39;s like the old joke right the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.260" end="00:46:28.920" style="s2">drunk loses his keys on the way home</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.940" end="00:46:30.070" style="s2">from the bar and then goes back and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.920" end="00:46:31.960" style="s2">searching for them underneath</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.070" end="00:46:33.610" style="s2">the streetlamp and somebody says is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.960" end="00:46:35.860" style="s2">where you lost them and he&#39;s like no but</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.610" end="00:46:38.020" style="s2">this is where the light is good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.860" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">the way that we tend to approach the ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.020" end="00:46:41.740" style="s2">we do all of our work there because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:44.020" style="s2">light is good we can see we can see</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.740" end="00:46:46.570" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but this leads us in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.020" end="00:46:49.570" style="s2">all kinds of bizarre existential errors</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.570" end="00:46:51.940" style="s2">because by thinking that we the ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.570" end="00:46:53.500" style="s2">right are the center of the show and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.940" end="00:46:55.600" style="s2">everything else is orbiting around us</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.500" end="00:46:58.750" style="s2">right we can&#39;t understand why things</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.600" end="00:47:02.020" style="s2">won&#39;t conform to our will we get thrown</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.750" end="00:47:04.330" style="s2">land you know sort of alien presences</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.020" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">seem to intrude on us or we behave in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.330" end="00:47:08.950" style="s2">ways that are contrary to our own self</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:11.590" style="s2">image and the idea is that gradually</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.950" end="00:47:13.270" style="s2">loosening up right your ego not</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.590" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">destroying it in sort of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.270" end="00:47:17.830" style="s2">sense in which you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:20.020" style="s2">obliterate the ego in you know some</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.830" end="00:47:22.510" style="s2">systems it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.020" end="00:47:24.340" style="s2">putting the ego into proper relation so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.510" end="00:47:28.540" style="s2">that you understand that you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.340" end="00:47:30.940" style="s2">boss of everything right and that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.540" end="00:47:33.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lessen or negate the very</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.940" end="00:47:35.470" style="s2">special role that you as the witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.790" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">consciousness and place of integration</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.470" end="00:47:40.270" style="s2">have but that ultimately speaking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">not the center of gravity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.270" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">there is something in the psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.820" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">possibly in the world if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:49.780" style="s2">metaphysical about it that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:55.930" style="s2">orchestrating this broader movement and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.780" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">dynamic right and you know when we get</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.930" end="00:48:01.120" style="s2">closer to that center right we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">perceive things as being more richly</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.120" end="00:48:05.560" style="s2">meaningful and more organized we get</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:08.860" style="s2">this kind of big-picture</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.560" end="00:48:12.370" style="s2">Gestalt integrative view right and when</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.860" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">that really starts to spike we get sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.370" end="00:48:17.800" style="s2">of like suffused with mystical levels of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:20.830" style="s2">integration and symbolism because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.800" end="00:48:22.360" style="s2">the only language dense enough to convey</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.830" end="00:48:24.940" style="s2">any of the information that&#39;s coming at</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:26.530" style="s2">us right which is also why if you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.940" end="00:48:28.210" style="s2">to develop a relationship with the self</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.530" end="00:48:30.580" style="s2">Jung says it&#39;s sort of indistinguishable</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.210" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">from God and so you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.580" end="00:48:35.059" style="s2">convinced</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:37.069" style="s2">existence or non-existence of God is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.059" end="00:48:39.109" style="s2">you know what what evidence could we get</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.069" end="00:48:41.480" style="s2">you know you can always apply skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.109" end="00:48:43.309" style="s2">to any evidence and you could always say</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.480" end="00:48:45.380" style="s2">that lack of evidence doesn&#39;t imply</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.309" end="00:48:46.849" style="s2">right evidence their absence of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.380" end="00:48:48.859" style="s2">isn&#39;t evidence of absence</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.849" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s not resolvable but the point</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.859" end="00:48:52.519" style="s2">is that you do definitely have this sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">of center within your psyche of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.519" end="00:49:00.049" style="s2">functioning and it transmits in</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:03.019" style="s2">symbolism and feeling and meaning and to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.049" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">organization but that is also language</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.019" end="00:49:07.730" style="s2">then it is most effectively spoken to if</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:09.289" style="s2">you want to develop a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.730" end="00:49:11.349" style="s2">this then you need to learn to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.289" end="00:49:13.250" style="s2">symbol you need to learn to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.349" end="00:49:15.769" style="s2">ritual you need to learn to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.250" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">myth that&#39;s why every human group</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.769" end="00:49:21.079" style="s2">everywhere for all of history and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:22.430" style="s2">prehistory you know I mean I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.079" end="00:49:23.690" style="s2">say something really definite but that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.430" end="00:49:25.250" style="s2">that would be the idea within this</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.690" end="00:49:27.829" style="s2">system would be that those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.250" end="00:49:29.539" style="s2">develop because it facilitates this kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.829" end="00:49:31.640" style="s2">of communication and then that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.539" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">come on kind of communication and puts</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:38.269" style="s2">you into an appropriate relationship if</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:41.210" style="s2">that makes sense no I I differ I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.269" end="00:49:43.309" style="s2">from lots of unions and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.210" end="00:49:44.990" style="s2">cognitive scientists because I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.309" end="00:49:45.559" style="s2">that you should leave everything on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.990" end="00:49:48.259" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.559" end="00:49:52.069" style="s2">so like the hellish chaos space that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.259" end="00:49:55.069" style="s2">describe right the like unanswerable</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.069" end="00:50:00.019" style="s2">whoa and meaningless and mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.069" end="00:50:03.079" style="s2">like the the brutal meaningless struggle</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.019" end="00:50:06.740" style="s2">of Darwinian organisms and bright jewel</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.079" end="00:50:09.470" style="s2">Wars all that right all of that people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.740" end="00:50:10.849" style="s2">want to throw that away and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.470" end="00:50:13.009" style="s2">throw away nihilism and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.849" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">throw away sadness and I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.009" end="00:50:20.089" style="s2">you keep it off because those things are</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:21.859" style="s2">useful so like it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.089" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">question and this is my this is my</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.859" end="00:50:25.910" style="s2">wizard talk coming through but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:28.789" style="s2">question is just how you befriend them</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.910" end="00:50:30.650" style="s2">how you make of them an ally so you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.789" end="00:50:33.230" style="s2">consider for instance this this slider</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.650" end="00:50:34.730" style="s2">right sometimes we feel like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.230" end="00:50:36.109" style="s2">predisposed to believe that there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.730" end="00:50:38.450" style="s2">a thing as free will whatever the hell</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.109" end="00:50:40.220" style="s2">that means right you know there&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.450" end="00:50:42.650" style="s2">will and there&#39;s determinism so free</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.220" end="00:50:43.700" style="s2">will is like yeah I really get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.650" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.700" end="00:50:46.770" style="s2">determinism is no I actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:48.870" style="s2">don&#39;t even if there&#39;s an illusion that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.770" end="00:50:50.340" style="s2">do and this rages back and forth in</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.870" end="00:50:51.630" style="s2">psychology and cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.340" end="00:50:54.030" style="s2">philosophy and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.630" end="00:50:56.040" style="s2">answerable how would we answer it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.030" end="00:50:58.830" style="s2">there is a difference in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.040" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">our narrative that our current emotional</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.830" end="00:51:04.110" style="s2">spin so on convey our feeling of free</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:05.790" style="s2">will right our sense of agency and some</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.110" end="00:51:08.280" style="s2">of that is reflecting how effective we</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.790" end="00:51:10.020" style="s2">are right how much fluency we have and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.280" end="00:51:12.030" style="s2">things like that flow States the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.020" end="00:51:13.860" style="s2">stuff but some of it it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.030" end="00:51:15.480" style="s2">the mindset that we work ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.860" end="00:51:18.290" style="s2">a little narrative and we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.480" end="00:51:20.850" style="s2">thinking good like free will agency good</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.290" end="00:51:23.310" style="s2">mechanistic determinism bad but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.850" end="00:51:25.530" style="s2">not true they can each from useful and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.310" end="00:51:27.270" style="s2">it depends on the circumstances so if</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.530" end="00:51:31.860" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.270" end="00:51:33.390" style="s2">psychological issues okay and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.860" end="00:51:35.460" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing serious depression</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.390" end="00:51:36.840" style="s2">you know what is the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.460" end="00:51:38.370" style="s2">should do and I would recommend this to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.840" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">all of my clients the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.370" end="00:51:43.020" style="s2">should do is go get a thyroid test right</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:45.390" style="s2">because if your thyroid function is</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.020" end="00:51:47.310" style="s2">disrupted you can have all kinds of mood</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.390" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">things and if people get their thyroid</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.310" end="00:51:51.030" style="s2">test and it turns out that they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:52.560" style="s2">know they&#39;re deficient and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.030" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">then they start taking thyroid</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.560" end="00:51:56.610" style="s2">medication they feel better well they</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.290" style="s2">just got a mechanistic explanation</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.610" end="00:52:00.750" style="s2">that&#39;s um that&#39;s a deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.290" end="00:52:02.370" style="s2">explanation sometimes a deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.750" end="00:52:05.400" style="s2">explanation is exactly what you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.370" end="00:52:07.050" style="s2">because it removes responsibility right</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.400" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">if you find out that your grandma is</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.050" end="00:52:10.290" style="s2">yelling at you but she doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:13.350" style="s2">hate your she has a brain tumor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.290" end="00:52:14.100" style="s2">tragic but also it&#39;s relieving because</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.350" end="00:52:17.820" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.100" end="00:52:19.530" style="s2">right likewise sometimes we have high</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.820" end="00:52:21.180" style="s2">agency and that&#39;s great I feel really</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.530" end="00:52:23.130" style="s2">uncharged on your life but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.180" end="00:52:25.620" style="s2">what that provokes is a crushing sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.130" end="00:52:28.410" style="s2">of responsibility and failure and guilt</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.620" end="00:52:29.340" style="s2">oh no I free will why can&#39;t I get my</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.410" end="00:52:33.240" style="s2">laundry done</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.340" end="00:52:35.130" style="s2">right why can&#39;t I you know get on top of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.240" end="00:52:37.710" style="s2">my shirt why can&#39;t I sort out my</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.130" end="00:52:39.900" style="s2">relationships free will and agency can</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.710" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">create this really crushing sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.900" end="00:52:44.130" style="s2">sometimes the answer is to say like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:45.510" style="s2">run yourself through the narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.130" end="00:52:48.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like well how could I have done</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.510" end="00:52:49.860" style="s2">things differently right and the facts</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.090" end="00:52:51.120" style="s2">are exactly the same but you&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.860" end="00:52:52.770" style="s2">a different kind of philosophical are</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.120" end="00:52:55.260" style="s2">you dragging yourself the words just</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.770" end="00:52:57.750" style="s2">deterministic to give yourself a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.260" end="00:52:59.220" style="s2">a break before you then move back into</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.750" end="00:53:01.109" style="s2">agency and move forward</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.220" end="00:53:04.290" style="s2">so you see have a slider it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.109" end="00:53:05.880" style="s2">one of the other is is intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.290" end="00:53:08.070" style="s2">always you want to set the setting here</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.880" end="00:53:09.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s that it&#39;s that you have a set</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.070" end="00:53:11.730" style="s2">of sliders and you want to be able move</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.730" end="00:53:14.700" style="s2">shape-shift yourself to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.869" end="00:53:16.920" style="s2">effective configuration for a situation</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.700" end="00:53:18.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like evolution right</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.920" end="00:53:20.609" style="s2">there&#39;s no apex predator if you throw a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.930" end="00:53:23.720" style="s2">shark into the desert it does not do</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.609" end="00:53:27.030" style="s2">well if your tiger in the ocean did oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.720" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">right yeah and it&#39;s adaptation is sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.030" end="00:53:31.740" style="s2">of structural anyway sorry okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:34.349" style="s2">yeah beautiful okay so so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.740" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">interesting is in the decision then to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.349" end="00:53:39.990" style="s2">go get a thyroid checked there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:42.599" style="s2">already inherent obviously in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.990" end="00:53:44.430" style="s2">decision that health would be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.599" end="00:53:46.830" style="s2">right I want to change it become</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.430" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">something else and then it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.830" end="00:53:51.150" style="s2">about well what tools are available for</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:52.859" style="s2">us and how can we sort when utilize them</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.150" end="00:53:55.470" style="s2">effectively how can we make effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.859" end="00:53:58.470" style="s2">choices and it&#39;s so complex of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.470" end="00:54:00.420" style="s2">because at one level we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.470" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">aspects of ourselves as having this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.420" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">machine-like function or at least we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.900" style="s2">have these sort of ready-made kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:08.369" style="s2">solutions and then there are other types</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.900" end="00:54:11.780" style="s2">of issues that are much more nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.369" end="00:54:15.240" style="s2">and we friend ourselves as agents</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.780" end="00:54:17.550" style="s2">seeking to sort of chart our path</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.240" end="00:54:18.780" style="s2">through all of these waters towards</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.550" end="00:54:21.180" style="s2">something I should say in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.780" end="00:54:27.869" style="s2">of growth or it just just just just to</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.180" end="00:54:31.410" style="s2">put a pin in that then we can still take</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.869" end="00:54:33.180" style="s2">the frame of what is it we ought move</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.410" end="00:54:35.700" style="s2">toward right there still that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.180" end="00:54:38.369" style="s2">question of art what odd we do and are</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.700" end="00:54:42.420" style="s2">sort of always already present</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.369" end="00:54:44.849" style="s2">involvement in action even in action as</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.420" end="00:54:48.349" style="s2">an action because the world is changing</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.849" end="00:54:51.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s having an having effects and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.349" end="00:54:58.800" style="s2">the one of the challenges of this moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.540" end="00:55:02.280" style="s2">is that we are as a collective unsure</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">about I think the future fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.280" end="00:55:04.260" style="s2">and there are people who have got ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.260" end="00:55:08.609" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;m so glad for that for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:11.880" style="s2">record I actually think it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.609" end="00:55:13.340" style="s2">thing but people have boned the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.880" end="00:55:14.900" style="s2">obviously right</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.340" end="00:55:15.890" style="s2">look this is not what anybody thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.900" end="00:55:18.860" style="s2">they were gonna be doing with their</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.890" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">summer sure that&#39;s fair to say right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.860" end="00:55:23.810" style="s2">but that&#39;s in my opinion that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:25.910" style="s2">because again on the note of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.810" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">people have a tendency to project ahead</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.910" end="00:55:30.380" style="s2">a model and a prediction about the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:32.360" style="s2">that the world is going to be in and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:34.820" style="s2">works in turn almost never matches that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.360" end="00:55:36.800" style="s2">model right but nevertheless they steer</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.820" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">according to it we get a normalcy bias</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.800" end="00:55:40.340" style="s2">at work right so like whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:41.630" style="s2">current circumstances are we assume</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.340" end="00:55:45.770" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be the way that it is and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.630" end="00:55:48.050" style="s2">people begin to think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.770" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">contingent structures in the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.050" end="00:55:53.630" style="s2">are necessary structures of reality but</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.150" style="s2">all the sudden when the brakes get hit</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.630" end="00:55:58.010" style="s2">hard and people realize holy crap like</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.150" end="00:56:00.260" style="s2">things are not what I thought that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.010" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">were right things are not rolling out</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.260" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">according to regular summer fun and holy</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:06.950" style="s2"> like a collective Oh am I allowed</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:09.350" style="s2">to swear I didn&#39;t even ask I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.950" end="00:56:14.200" style="s2">that&#39;s rude please okay you complete me</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.350" end="00:56:16.730" style="s2">if you want sound of Gus Gosling or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.200" end="00:56:18.860" style="s2">you know having that disrupted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.730" end="00:56:20.690" style="s2">terrifying and it&#39;s anxiety provoking</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.860" end="00:56:21.950" style="s2">for people right we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:23.480" style="s2">know what we&#39;re gonna do we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.950" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">what our plans are we&#39;ve disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.480" end="00:56:28.700" style="s2">all of those things but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.290" style="s2">what it does is it shakes up this</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.700" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">tightly bound</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.290" end="00:56:34.670" style="s2">sense of where things are going and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.870" style="s2">that sense right it suddenly opens up</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.670" end="00:56:38.420" style="s2">the possibility I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.870" end="00:56:40.130" style="s2">coincidental that the social uprising is</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.420" end="00:56:41.990" style="s2">that are happening are happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.130" end="00:56:44.450" style="s2">wake of such a large disruption a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.990" end="00:56:45.950" style="s2">disruption that large does all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.450" end="00:56:47.660" style="s2">things that people politically point out</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.950" end="00:56:49.640" style="s2">right has showed the ineptness of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.660" end="00:56:52.760" style="s2">certain governments and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.640" end="00:56:54.650" style="s2">crass to face it nests and self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.760" end="00:56:57.800" style="s2">of some parties and I&#39;m not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.650" end="00:56:59.720" style="s2">too political maybe I did you know and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.800" end="00:57:01.610" style="s2">on top of that it shows a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.720" end="00:57:03.350" style="s2">of precarity it&#39;s like oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.610" end="00:57:07.190" style="s2">like things could things fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.350" end="00:57:10.250" style="s2">right and right but also it&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.190" end="00:57:12.410" style="s2">if things do not have to be the way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.250" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">they were yesterday if indeed they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.410" end="00:57:16.490" style="s2">already not that what can they be and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:19.880" style="s2">once people start to get over their</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.490" end="00:57:23.540" style="s2">initial anxiety right and then there you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.880" end="00:57:24.770" style="s2">know stir crazy and bored right I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.540" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">think of worse things for stir crazy</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.770" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">bored I&#39;m going to be poured into then</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">writing injustice and so I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:36.550" style="s2">some ways it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a wake-up</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:38.230" style="s2">call to have a global event of the scale</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.550" end="00:57:40.060" style="s2">and although it&#39;s freaked everybody out</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.230" end="00:57:42.040" style="s2">and everybody has lingered on the sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.060" end="00:57:44.200" style="s2">of negative qualities emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.040" end="00:57:46.150" style="s2">speaking of it I think that actually the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.200" end="00:57:47.710" style="s2">net is probably positive in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.150" end="00:57:51.900" style="s2">that a bad trip can be good for you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.710" end="00:57:55.030" style="s2">yes yes well we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.900" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m straying off off-script no no</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.030" end="00:58:00.040" style="s2">no no well there one script so the issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.240" end="00:58:01.690" style="s2">is of course is that the script has been</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.040" end="00:58:03.160" style="s2">broken and that&#39;s a good thing yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.690" end="00:58:06.850" style="s2">are in the process of built making the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.160" end="00:58:08.590" style="s2">script and a bunch of things a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.850" end="00:58:13.210" style="s2">things are coming to me so one is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.590" end="00:58:16.690" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like if we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.210" end="00:58:20.020" style="s2">in an addiction certain ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.690" end="00:58:21.400" style="s2">patterns of behavior it&#39;s often the case</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.020" end="00:58:23.740" style="s2">that reaching a certain kind of rock</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.400" end="00:58:25.930" style="s2">bottom is very very useful in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.740" end="00:58:29.980" style="s2">enabling this reorientation right</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.930" end="00:58:32.140" style="s2">there&#39;s been sort of breaking apart and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.980" end="00:58:35.080" style="s2">an opportunity for a full enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.140" end="00:58:37.840" style="s2">dissolution so as to reorient and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.080" end="00:58:40.110" style="s2">reintegrate in a way that&#39;s more aligned</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.840" end="00:58:45.070" style="s2">with something that&#39;s genuinely healthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.110" end="00:58:47.560" style="s2">but but an issue is that well what if</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.070" end="00:58:49.540" style="s2">that moment of hitting the rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.560" end="00:58:53.530" style="s2">actually wasn&#39;t quite sufficient enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.540" end="00:58:56.620" style="s2">and we&#39;ve clasped back on and maybe re</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.530" end="00:58:58.300" style="s2">embed part of the issue or take</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.620" end="00:59:00.220" style="s2">ourselves to have finally solved it but</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.300" end="00:59:02.440" style="s2">actually haven&#39;t but we&#39;ve become only</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.220" end="00:59:04.440" style="s2">more ardent in our commitment to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.440" end="00:59:11.280" style="s2">new pattern of action there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.440" end="00:59:14.850" style="s2">there&#39;s an importance in reaching a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:21.340" style="s2">ground that is open enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.850" end="00:59:22.810" style="s2">appropriately seeded and so sure if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.340" end="00:59:24.630" style="s2">if you allow me understand I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.810" end="00:59:27.940" style="s2">and put quite a few more pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.630" end="00:59:30.610" style="s2">here there&#39;s I sense this potential and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.940" end="00:59:32.290" style="s2">I there&#39;s a question that&#39;s like three</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.610" end="00:59:34.870" style="s2">or four pieces away from me that wants</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.290" end="00:59:38.770" style="s2">to come out and and I I really sense you</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.870" end="00:59:39.980" style="s2">have you have something to to deepen of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.770" end="00:59:50.320" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.980" end="00:59:52.790" style="s2">so when we when we undergo these</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.320" end="00:59:54.680" style="s2">processes of development these these</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.790" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">juncture points in life where we they</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:07.490" style="s2">helpful but we want to it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:11.960" style="s2">when we do that we also need the context</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.490" end="01:00:15.050" style="s2">itself to be enabling of continued</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.960" end="01:00:17.330" style="s2">growth &#39;fl continued of that new</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.050" end="01:00:18.740" style="s2">behavior so you know if someone comes to</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.330" end="01:00:20.270" style="s2">an understanding that they really have</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.740" end="01:00:22.340" style="s2">to kick this particular habit but then</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.270" end="01:00:23.510" style="s2">re-enters the same social group there</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.340" end="01:00:27.230" style="s2">might be something that draws them back</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.510" end="01:00:29.300" style="s2">so the context itself has to be enabling</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.230" end="01:00:32.119" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.300" end="01:00:33.800" style="s2">relationship there between sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.119" end="01:00:35.570" style="s2">agent and a reader and John&#39;s language</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.800" end="01:00:39.470" style="s2">is cell phone contact self and world</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.570" end="01:00:44.060" style="s2">self and other and in this moment it</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.470" end="01:00:45.470" style="s2">seems the integration we seek we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.060" end="01:00:47.510" style="s2">getting a lot of opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.470" end="01:00:51.170" style="s2">differentiation although it&#39;s clear in</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.510" end="01:00:53.270" style="s2">many parts of society to me there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.170" end="01:00:55.430" style="s2">actually us that that differentiation</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.270" end="01:00:57.290" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like people are so desk</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.430" end="01:00:59.119" style="s2">they&#39;re so terrified actually of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.290" end="01:01:01.490" style="s2">ground groundlessness beneath that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.119" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">there&#39;s already too hard an attachment</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.490" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">to various kind of identity structures</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:07.850" style="s2">which are not actually capable of coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.020" end="01:01:09.740" style="s2">into right relationship with reality so</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.850" end="01:01:12.500" style="s2">if we take the human organism as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.740" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">body as part of that thing that house is</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.500" end="01:01:16.940" style="s2">still divided hey the house is still is</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:19.930" style="s2">still very much divided um so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.940" end="01:01:22.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of an issue with the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.930" end="01:01:24.230" style="s2">fullness let&#39;s say of the or</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.250" end="01:01:26.390" style="s2">appropriateness of the dissolution or</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.230" end="01:01:31.300" style="s2">fullness of it but then if we look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.390" end="01:01:34.090" style="s2">this this reintegration there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.300" end="01:01:38.390" style="s2">necessity of doing that together of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.090" end="01:01:40.070" style="s2">relating together and we are absent it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.390" end="01:01:41.840" style="s2">seems to me so many of the structures</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.070" end="01:01:43.880" style="s2">that would be really helpful in this so</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.840" end="01:01:46.520" style="s2">we talk about an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.880" end="01:01:49.910" style="s2">that&#39;s important and that might be to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.520" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">help bring the different parts of us our</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.910" end="01:01:53.660" style="s2">psyche into a certain kind of alignment</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:56.299" style="s2">to be afforded the develop</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.660" end="01:01:57.829" style="s2">mental opportunity to become more of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.299" end="01:01:59.960" style="s2">sort of a whole and together and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.829" end="01:02:01.940" style="s2">Integris human being but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.960" end="01:02:04.220" style="s2">time this question grips me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.940" end="01:02:07.700" style="s2">well what if I actually cannot become</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.220" end="01:02:10.460" style="s2">Who I am without for example the place</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.700" end="01:02:14.630" style="s2">to be in so you know how come</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.460" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">how can someone become a become a priest</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.630" end="01:02:20.329" style="s2">or a saint without a church or a temple</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">you know how can we become sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.329" end="01:02:26.690" style="s2">loving members of community without</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:30.049" style="s2">genuine community and the other pieces</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.690" end="01:02:32.210" style="s2">kind of bring in is that I I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.049" end="01:02:35.089" style="s2">interested in this question of what is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.210" end="01:02:38.150" style="s2">it how can we consider what an emergence</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.089" end="01:02:41.000" style="s2">of kind of novel archetypal patterns</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.150" end="01:02:45.730" style="s2">might be novel archetypal forms and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.000" end="01:02:49.460" style="s2">my sense is that an area of real</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.730" end="01:02:53.089" style="s2">possibility is to consider the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.460" end="01:02:56.420" style="s2">emergence possible if a certain group of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.089" end="01:02:58.940" style="s2">people are able to be together in</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.420" end="01:03:00.650" style="s2">relationship and involve themselves in</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.940" end="01:03:04.520" style="s2">certain kinds of differentiating and</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.650" end="01:03:09.130" style="s2">integrating processes in touch with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.520" end="01:03:12.200" style="s2">world what kind of arrangements kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.130" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">appropriate relation of patterns is then</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.200" end="01:03:17.990" style="s2">possible in the context which perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:20.059" style="s2">can enable not only the becoming of self</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.990" end="01:03:22.579" style="s2">as we might understand it from a union</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.059" end="01:03:25.190" style="s2">framework but is there something is</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.579" end="01:03:27.890" style="s2">there something ready and waiting in us</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.190" end="01:03:29.480" style="s2">beyond that I I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.890" end="01:03:31.160" style="s2">not saying we&#39;re right here yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.480" end="01:03:33.410" style="s2">still other pieces the presence but as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.160" end="01:03:34.910" style="s2">sort of broad direction of where I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.410" end="01:03:37.010" style="s2">love to turn this acquire inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.910" end="01:03:42.680" style="s2">eventually it&#39;s like how can we come</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.010" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">together to realize that which is an arc</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.680" end="01:03:48.849" style="s2">you know it is something of sustenance</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:51.500" style="s2">and fructifying possibility that can</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.849" end="01:03:56.680" style="s2">have us become who we are and live well</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.500" end="01:04:01.730" style="s2">and prosper throughout the coming time</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.680" end="01:04:02.809" style="s2">yeah okay so there&#39;s a lot of material</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.730" end="01:04:05.490" style="s2">on the table but I think I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.809" end="01:04:06.810" style="s2">leave it so so</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.490" end="01:04:09.570" style="s2">I mean you know one thing is you</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.810" end="01:04:12.630" style="s2">mentioned this you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.570" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">trying to get ourselves into a social</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.630" end="01:04:16.470" style="s2">relatedness and I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:19.410" style="s2">certainly one of the central points in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.470" end="01:04:22.260" style="s2">my own work is about attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.410" end="01:04:23.430" style="s2">explore the implications and mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.260" end="01:04:26.130" style="s2">of all the stuff that I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.430" end="01:04:27.540" style="s2">relative to trans Jack tivity so the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.130" end="01:04:29.250" style="s2">fact that psychic events are</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.540" end="01:04:31.830" style="s2">simultaneously pointing inwards and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.250" end="01:04:33.750" style="s2">outwards so that that means some</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.830" end="01:04:35.700" style="s2">important things right and so among</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.750" end="01:04:38.520" style="s2">other things that means that you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.700" end="01:04:41.160" style="s2">our usual cartesian idea of our mind is</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.520" end="01:04:43.500" style="s2">a closed-off little thing is basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.160" end="01:04:45.720" style="s2">horseshit and it&#39;s just wrong in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.500" end="01:04:48.119" style="s2">of ways because there&#39;s a sense of which</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.720" end="01:04:49.890" style="s2">are imitative patterns and relationships</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.119" end="01:04:51.869" style="s2">all of our culture and language and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.890" end="01:04:54.420" style="s2">stuff high us together into kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.869" end="01:04:56.490" style="s2">distributed cognition right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.420" end="01:04:57.900" style="s2">just natural to humans it&#39;s what we do</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.490" end="01:05:00.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.900" end="01:05:02.430" style="s2">literacy is acquired but speech speech</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.600" end="01:05:05.100" style="s2">is just like we just pick up languages</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.430" end="01:05:06.360" style="s2">because we are talkers we&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.100" end="01:05:08.730" style="s2">only talkers there are other animals</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.360" end="01:05:10.530" style="s2">that communicate but but nobody else</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.730" end="01:05:12.450" style="s2">maybe whales once we cracked the code</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.530" end="01:05:15.810" style="s2">but I get it I think we&#39;re the only ones</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.450" end="01:05:19.050" style="s2">on this particular ball that are talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.810" end="01:05:23.070" style="s2">at this level in machine elves on DMT</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.050" end="01:05:24.540" style="s2">not standing so we&#39;re the only ones who</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.070" end="01:05:26.369" style="s2">are employing this particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.540" end="01:05:28.380" style="s2">networking so like is there something</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.369" end="01:05:30.810" style="s2">that&#39;s built into us yeah our capacity</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.380" end="01:05:33.210" style="s2">for distributed cognition but in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.810" end="01:05:34.710" style="s2">right that&#39;s it&#39;s really if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.210" end="01:05:36.780" style="s2">the perspective this way that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.710" end="01:05:37.980" style="s2">outgrowth of what we already are so</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.780" end="01:05:39.510" style="s2">we&#39;re used to thinking of ourselves as</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.980" end="01:05:40.920" style="s2">these single individuals and then we</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.510" end="01:05:43.350" style="s2">network the individuals together but</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.920" end="01:05:47.010" style="s2">really we&#39;re not individual we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.350" end="01:05:49.050" style="s2">dividual right there there is a unifying</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.010" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">principle in the same way as there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.050" end="01:05:52.470" style="s2">unifying principle in the solar system</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:54.359" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.470" end="01:05:56.940" style="s2">that&#39;s or system is one few solid mass</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.359" end="01:05:58.890" style="s2">there are dynamics and orbits right</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.940" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot going on right comets</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.890" end="01:06:02.250" style="s2">shooting through and stuff nevertheless</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:03.930" style="s2">the Sun is in the center that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.250" end="01:06:05.400" style="s2">power source and it&#39;s the gravity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.930" end="01:06:07.950" style="s2">binding the system together into a</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.400" end="01:06:09.900" style="s2">sensible whole and everything is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.950" end="01:06:13.560" style="s2">going through it&#39;s cosmic you know a</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.900" end="01:06:14.970" style="s2">ballet around that but in turn right the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.560" end="01:06:18.990" style="s2">way that we are relating to each other</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.970" end="01:06:21.960" style="s2">you know is also its built-in or</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.990" end="01:06:24.180" style="s2">do not distinguish closely between</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.960" end="01:06:26.820" style="s2">internal events and external events and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.180" end="01:06:29.160" style="s2">so we&#39;re already networked together so</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.820" end="01:06:32.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the capacity it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.160" end="01:06:33.990" style="s2">capacity and it&#39;s the adaptivity right</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.130" end="01:06:36.630" style="s2">it&#39;s the adaptiveness that comes with</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.990" end="01:06:38.010" style="s2">that so even something like when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.010" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">differentiating and integrating right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.800" end="01:06:43.950" style="s2">you know you differentiate you pull</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:47.070" style="s2">things apart you integrate you knit them</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.950" end="01:06:48.570" style="s2">together and if you simultaneously right</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.070" end="01:06:50.760" style="s2">integrate and differentiate you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.570" end="01:06:52.170" style="s2">complexify right literally that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.760" end="01:06:54.930" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re talking about organs</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.170" end="01:06:56.910" style="s2">you know you get a single cell right as</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.930" end="01:06:58.230" style="s2">well - I guess sperm and egg and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.910" end="01:07:00.570" style="s2">the single cell becomes a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.230" end="01:07:02.700" style="s2">blastocyte and when that starts to stem</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.570" end="01:07:05.100" style="s2">cell itself into separate organs it</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.700" end="01:07:06.840" style="s2">differentiates it organizes right they</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.100" end="01:07:08.790" style="s2">take on special functions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.840" end="01:07:10.950" style="s2">simultaneously separating out becoming</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.790" end="01:07:12.240" style="s2">different but also maintaining deads</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.950" end="01:07:14.820" style="s2">connections we&#39;ve done that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.240" end="01:07:17.100" style="s2">civilization right I mean specialist</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.820" end="01:07:18.840" style="s2">roles the fact that we do not all do the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.100" end="01:07:20.970" style="s2">same tasks in the village every day</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.840" end="01:07:24.810" style="s2">right is an indication already that</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.970" end="01:07:28.830" style="s2">we&#39;ve done that now I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.810" end="01:07:31.020" style="s2">complexity is an inherent goal right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:32.869" style="s2">complexity is a gain of fitness</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.020" end="01:07:35.600" style="s2">condition something could be too complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.869" end="01:07:37.710" style="s2">right something can be too complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.600" end="01:07:41.070" style="s2">civilizations can be too complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.710" end="01:07:43.410" style="s2">Homer Dixon has a good analysis of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.070" end="01:07:45.390" style="s2">Thomas Homer Dixon where he basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.410" end="01:07:47.070" style="s2">says you know once once the civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.390" end="01:07:48.930" style="s2">gets to a point where of certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.070" end="01:07:51.359" style="s2">complexity to much of its energy budget</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.930" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">gets eaten up just in maintaining those</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.359" end="01:07:55.830" style="s2">structures and then it collapses in on</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:57.060" style="s2">itself right and it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.830" end="01:07:58.109" style="s2">we&#39;re quite close to steering in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.060" end="01:08:01.410" style="s2">direction that we need to be less</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.109" end="01:08:05.670" style="s2">complex right but at the same time and</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.410" end="01:08:09.030" style="s2">you sort of alluded to this we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.670" end="01:08:12.150" style="s2">of an unmapped territory and I mean in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.030" end="01:08:14.520" style="s2">very important realistic way and in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.150" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">way that I think barring the extinction</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.520" end="01:08:18.089" style="s2">of our species there are certain aspects</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:21.540" style="s2">of where we&#39;ve gotten to now that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.089" end="01:08:24.390" style="s2">about to ratchet down so young talks</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.540" end="01:08:25.910" style="s2">about this a bit in his book ion he</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.390" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">talks I mean it&#39;s a very unusual</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.910" end="01:08:30.029" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:31.890" style="s2">weird frightening delicious book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.029" end="01:08:33.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a great book it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.890" end="01:08:36.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.420" end="01:08:38.779" style="s2">he talks about a lot about astrology and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.359" end="01:08:41.850" style="s2">so he&#39;s using sort of metaphors of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.779" end="01:08:43.890" style="s2">procession of the the astrological types</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.850" end="01:08:46.679" style="s2">and he&#39;s like two thousand year long for</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.890" end="01:08:48.420" style="s2">2500 year long cycles and so you know he</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.679" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">talks about how the Age of Pisces is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.420" end="01:08:52.290" style="s2">two fish it&#39;s the Christian era and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.400" end="01:08:53.790" style="s2">dominated by the fish myths of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.290" end="01:08:55.380" style="s2">Christian era right and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.790" end="01:08:58.049" style="s2">theoretically we&#39;re now state easing</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.380" end="01:09:02.310" style="s2">into the Age of Aquarius right cue</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.049" end="01:09:04.140" style="s2">musical and his point is that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.310" end="01:09:05.699" style="s2">transition into the Age of Aquarius is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.140" end="01:09:07.259" style="s2">going to be marked that is change in</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.699" end="01:09:09.500" style="s2">collective and personal unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.259" end="01:09:12.540" style="s2">right that it&#39;s going to be marked by</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.500" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">new structures of civilization on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.540" end="01:09:17.549" style="s2">scale and complexity and degree of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:19.890" style="s2">integrated meaning as the church had in</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.549" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">Europe and its heyday right well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.890" end="01:09:23.880" style="s2">talking about something that is binding</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">together the efforts and experience so</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.880" end="01:09:28.380" style="s2">that&#39;s watts of people and what they</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">think is meaningful and I sometimes say</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.380" end="01:09:32.009" style="s2">it&#39;s like there are people who kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:33.779" style="s2">think that your average peasant in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.009" end="01:09:36.779" style="s2">Middle Ages thought Christianity was</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.779" end="01:09:38.730" style="s2">Buncombe but there are also towns in</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.779" end="01:09:40.980" style="s2">France where three generations of people</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.730" end="01:09:44.819" style="s2">would work to build a cathedral that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.980" end="01:09:46.170" style="s2">what they did the last shared cultural</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.819" end="01:09:48.179" style="s2">project that we&#39;ve had that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.170" end="01:09:51.779" style="s2">remotely like that it&#39;s maybe the moon</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.179" end="01:09:53.219" style="s2">live right which you know say what you</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.779" end="01:09:55.020" style="s2">will about solving the problems on earth</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.219" end="01:09:57.630" style="s2">as opposed to squandering money on</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.020" end="01:09:59.429" style="s2">rocket toys the moon landing in my</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.630" end="01:10:02.150" style="s2">opinion if you don&#39;t just think it&#39;s us</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.429" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">trashing our next-door neighbor&#39;s lawn</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.150" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">by leaving garbage and probes all over</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:09.330" style="s2">it is this resounding astounding</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:11.370" style="s2">achievement of the human spirit and</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.330" end="01:10:12.989" style="s2">about our capacities when I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.370" end="01:10:18.210" style="s2">have anything going like that right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.989" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">like what&#39;s her goal ours is going there</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.210" end="01:10:23.699" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have a cathedral and young</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:25.260" style="s2">basically said as we move into the Age</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.699" end="01:10:29.429" style="s2">of Aquarius and he&#39;s using this all</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.260" end="01:10:32.130" style="s2">metaphorically I think we would see the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.429" end="01:10:34.410" style="s2">emergence of a new social structure that</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.130" end="01:10:36.540" style="s2">would sort of that would take these new</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.410" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">psychic factors and new scientific facts</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.540" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">into consideration and then he sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:43.610" style="s2">drops and he&#39;s like and we should see</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:45.999" style="s2">that about 600 years down the road and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.610" end="01:10:48.039" style="s2">when I read that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.999" end="01:10:50.170" style="s2">my numbers might not be exact I should</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.039" end="01:10:54.130" style="s2">pick up the quote but when I read that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.170" end="01:10:56.559" style="s2">the first time it smacked me because of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.130" end="01:10:59.429" style="s2">course obviously I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.559" end="01:11:02.440" style="s2">have them like now because I&#39;m here now</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.429" end="01:11:04.300" style="s2">like yeah where&#39;s the new civilization</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.440" end="01:11:05.530" style="s2">and he&#39;s like oh that should happen like</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.300" end="01:11:08.619" style="s2">six hundred years down the road it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.530" end="01:11:11.139" style="s2">like write that properly situates uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.619" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">somewhat it&#39;s a process now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.139" end="01:11:15.729" style="s2">think that it&#39;s inevitable that that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:18.099" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s inevitable necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.729" end="01:11:20.110" style="s2">that like the new and perfect society</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.099" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">will emerge you know the the Mirage of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.110" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">utopianism was what caused the worst</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:27.340" style="s2">most horrific excesses of the pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:30.280" style="s2">religious ideologies of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.340" end="01:11:32.729" style="s2">because if you&#39;re Stalin and you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.280" end="01:11:37.269" style="s2">with if Heaven is within your grasp any</p>

<p begin="01:11:39.699" end="01:11:43.420" style="s2">things get monster as quickly so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:44.949" style="s2">wary of utopian thinking I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.420" end="01:11:47.229" style="s2">going to be flaws and whatever the new</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.949" end="01:11:51.400" style="s2">configuration of being is to this flaws</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.229" end="01:11:53.469" style="s2">are interesting and my suspicion to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.400" end="01:11:55.690" style="s2">perfectly honest is like we&#39;re in for a</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.469" end="01:11:58.809" style="s2">rocky stretch like if we think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.690" end="01:12:00.489" style="s2">gonna dodge what&#39;s coming and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.809" end="01:12:02.349" style="s2">like to I don&#39;t want to freak people out</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.489" end="01:12:04.329" style="s2">too much because sometimes I get on this</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.349" end="01:12:07.479" style="s2">care and then I look and my students all</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.329" end="01:12:10.869" style="s2">have a bleak middle-distance staring off</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.479" end="01:12:12.849" style="s2">into whatever but like there are some</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.869" end="01:12:14.380" style="s2">things coming we&#39;re about to get some</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.849" end="01:12:16.539" style="s2">come up ents and learn a few things</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.380" end="01:12:19.929" style="s2">about thermodynamics we&#39;re gonna learn a</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.539" end="01:12:21.639" style="s2">few things about you know monkeying</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.929" end="01:12:23.559" style="s2">around with nature for short-term goals</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.639" end="01:12:25.360" style="s2">like we&#39;re about to learn some hard</p>

<p begin="01:12:25.360" end="01:12:30.840" style="s2">mean a lot of people are gonna die like</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.699" end="01:12:33.550" style="s2">it&#39;s possibly going to be quite bad yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.840" end="01:12:36.550" style="s2">or ability to handle consciously</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.550" end="01:12:38.559" style="s2">collective action problems I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.550" end="01:12:41.070" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re gonna turn the boat around</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.559" end="01:12:43.900" style="s2">on the whole climate change issue before</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.070" end="01:12:47.110" style="s2">effect start really piling up and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.900" end="01:12:50.079" style="s2">scares me deeply it you know sometimes</p>

<p begin="01:12:55.179" end="01:12:59.610" style="s2">gonna wipe us out right that&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.360" end="01:13:01.890" style="s2">think about it the</p>

<p begin="01:13:09.030" end="01:13:14.070" style="s2">maybe not I don&#39;t know it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.240" end="01:13:15.750" style="s2">experiment and some of the aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.070" end="01:13:18.120" style="s2">that experiment even as our cultural</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.750" end="01:13:21.540" style="s2">complexity drops will remain so for</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.120" end="01:13:23.460" style="s2">instance I think I think that even if</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.540" end="01:13:27.780" style="s2">our even if we got hit with an enormous</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.460" end="01:13:29.910" style="s2">disaster right you know 80% of the</p>

<p begin="01:13:29.910" end="01:13:34.680" style="s2">something horrific and unimaginable</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.300" end="01:13:36.450" style="s2">there are certain things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.680" end="01:13:40.920" style="s2">achieved in the last well that aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.920" end="01:13:46.110" style="s2">know how to build a radio radios aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.500" end="01:13:48.150" style="s2">hard to build if local civilization</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.110" end="01:13:50.010" style="s2">falls apart I can build a radio with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.150" end="01:13:52.800" style="s2">few pieces of spare metal and some</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.010" end="01:13:55.200" style="s2">lemons that means that radio</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:57.170" style="s2">communications in my opinion unless we</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.200" end="01:13:59.670" style="s2">you know if we drop down to total like</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.170" end="01:14:01.140" style="s2">caveman cannibalistic savagery or</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.670" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">something then that&#39;s a different story</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.140" end="01:14:06.240" style="s2">but like even if these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:07.860" style="s2">large-scale tightly specialized you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.240" end="01:14:10.290" style="s2">right if we enter something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.860" end="01:14:11.850" style="s2">really scary prospect for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.290" end="01:14:14.340" style="s2">people there are certain things you just</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.850" end="01:14:16.410" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing away and so I suspect that</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.340" end="01:14:18.810" style="s2">probably we&#39;re going to see a certain</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.410" end="01:14:21.090" style="s2">amount of return to the natural bounds</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.810" end="01:14:23.910" style="s2">of balance of what the planet can handle</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.090" end="01:14:26.760" style="s2">in terms of our activities but also</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.910" end="01:14:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go back to that level of</p>

<p begin="01:14:42.420" end="01:14:49.220" style="s2">experiment because that&#39;s what life is</p>

<p begin="01:17:06.900" end="01:17:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the future and it&#39;s the deep future</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.310" end="01:17:14.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s a deep future that isn&#39;t Star</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.920" end="01:17:15.660" style="s2">Trek and it isn&#39;t unrecognizably sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.040" end="01:17:18.060" style="s2">post singularity or something it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.660" end="01:17:20.130" style="s2">future where things are a bit less</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.060" end="01:17:22.800" style="s2">mechanized and yet there are machines</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.130" end="01:17:24.660" style="s2">and technology governments and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:27.030" style="s2">still exist but there&#39;s been a return to</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.660" end="01:17:29.909" style="s2">a certain version of</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.030" end="01:17:32.219" style="s2">culture and science we&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.909" end="01:17:33.869" style="s2">sciences and academics and culture and</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.219" end="01:17:36.559" style="s2">sort of almost a church thing have</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.869" end="01:17:39.690" style="s2">blended together into a kind of you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.559" end="01:17:41.789" style="s2">almost a Vatican desk state called</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.690" end="01:17:43.349" style="s2">castelia up in Switzerland and like</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.789" end="01:17:46.139" style="s2">obviously this speaks to my heart</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.349" end="01:17:48.360" style="s2">because all I want to do is be a you</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.139" end="01:17:50.340" style="s2">know a futuristic techno monk or</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.360" end="01:17:52.170" style="s2">something I don&#39;t want to be a monk but</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.340" end="01:17:53.489" style="s2">it&#39;s already discussed but if I could be</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.170" end="01:17:56.670" style="s2">a techno lizard I&#39;m on board</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.489" end="01:18:00.239" style="s2">um so it has a vision of things that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.670" end="01:18:02.489" style="s2">struck me as very human and yet showing</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.239" end="01:18:04.889" style="s2">like real changes in the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.489" end="01:18:07.320" style="s2">landscape and that&#39;s if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.889" end="01:18:10.440" style="s2">it often what science fiction even when</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.320" end="01:18:12.119" style="s2">it sort of gets things right misses you</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.440" end="01:18:14.070" style="s2">know we transport into the thirty</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.119" end="01:18:15.840" style="s2">seventh century with robots and ray guns</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.070" end="01:18:18.150" style="s2">and miniskirts it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.840" end="01:18:20.750" style="s2">miniskirts is that that&#39;s still a thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.150" end="01:18:23.300" style="s2">and HESA instead captures something</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.750" end="01:18:28.250" style="s2">about this sort of the humanistic</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.300" end="01:18:30.389" style="s2">speculative future yeah right so and</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.250" end="01:18:33.300" style="s2">actually okay so one more thing that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.389" end="01:18:35.400" style="s2">I&#39;ll say and then I&#39;ll stop but the</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.300" end="01:18:37.440" style="s2">other thing that has gets and I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.400" end="01:18:39.360" style="s2">this is why it does send chills up your</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:41.039" style="s2">spine when you read it I mean he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.360" end="01:18:43.289" style="s2">a very depth psychologically oriented</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.039" end="01:18:46.409" style="s2">very archetypal right big fan of young</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.289" end="01:18:48.119" style="s2">men through analysis right and he wrote</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.409" end="01:18:49.739" style="s2">that book as a response after people</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.119" end="01:18:52.889" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand Steppenwolf</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.739" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">right and so Steppenwolf was meant to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.889" end="01:18:57.360" style="s2">this kind of archetypal confrontation as</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:59.369" style="s2">a novel again good book but people just</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.360" end="01:19:01.739" style="s2">misread it right they they read it</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.369" end="01:19:03.090" style="s2">because they weren&#39;t ready quite have</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.739" end="01:19:05.520" style="s2">that encounter it was sort of a gain</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.090" end="01:19:07.260" style="s2">before its time and he writes the glass</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.520" end="01:19:10.690" style="s2">bead game as a response to try to like</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.260" end="01:19:13.180" style="s2">get this idea through to people</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.690" end="01:19:15.310" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s remarkably prescient right</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.180" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">it has that predictive capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.310" end="01:19:19.630" style="s2">that&#39;s because the flip side of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:21.489" style="s2">we&#39;re in an open experiment and what</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.630" end="01:19:22.570" style="s2">what life is doing and culture is doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.489" end="01:19:24.310" style="s2">in the species is doing its</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.570" end="01:19:26.890" style="s2">experimenting with the space to figure</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.310" end="01:19:29.530" style="s2">out where it can get itself to right</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.890" end="01:19:31.989" style="s2">what can we do right and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.530" end="01:19:34.660" style="s2">measure ourselves and whatever the flip</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.989" end="01:19:36.580" style="s2">side of that is again we have these deep</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.660" end="01:19:39.699" style="s2">intrinsic patterns in what it means to</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.580" end="01:19:41.710" style="s2">be us and because those patterns don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.699" end="01:19:44.050" style="s2">go away and to some extent may be</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.710" end="01:19:46.090" style="s2">grounded in sort of the rules the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.050" end="01:19:48.340" style="s2">mathematical rules to constitute reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.090" end="01:19:49.719" style="s2">in some ways right because those</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.340" end="01:19:53.580" style="s2">fundamentals are there</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.719" end="01:19:56.500" style="s2">history doesn&#39;t repeat but it does rhyme</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.580" end="01:19:58.660" style="s2">right you get that quality where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.500" end="01:20:02.260" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.660" end="01:20:04.239" style="s2">you know but and yet things are started</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.260" end="01:20:06.280" style="s2">recognizable so you read big history</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.239" end="01:20:08.830" style="s2">like um you know the decline and fall of</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.280" end="01:20:10.810" style="s2">the Roman Empire or twin be something</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.830" end="01:20:13.900" style="s2">and they have this idea of the cyclical</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.810" end="01:20:15.550" style="s2">nature of history and when you start to</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.900" end="01:20:18.250" style="s2">read that stuff structuralist history is</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.550" end="01:20:21.699" style="s2">out of fashion and yet of course for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.250" end="01:20:23.710" style="s2">past few years called five everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.699" end="01:20:26.680" style="s2">been nervously tenting their fingers and</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.710" end="01:20:28.449" style="s2">looking back to the mass psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.680" end="01:20:31.719" style="s2">rise of fascism in the thirties and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.449" end="01:20:34.090" style="s2">going um like maybe we should be paying</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.719" end="01:20:37.480" style="s2">attention for this why because it rhymes</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.090" end="01:20:39.400" style="s2">now I mean the current droplets the</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.480" end="01:20:42.610" style="s2">current crop of autocrats are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.400" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">tin pot cosplayers if ever there were</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.610" end="01:20:47.890" style="s2">any but nevertheless you know that they</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:51.370" style="s2">would enact as much malevolence I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.890" end="01:20:56.210" style="s2">as they were capable of given the chance</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.370" end="01:20:58.910" style="s2">yeah oh yeah no I hear you that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.210" end="01:21:04.040" style="s2">such a beautiful answer so what strikes</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.910" end="01:21:05.870" style="s2">me is that the the you mentioned you</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.040" end="01:21:08.000" style="s2">know if we have this this event say</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.870" end="01:21:11.300" style="s2">eighty percent of people don&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:13.160" style="s2">but we can reconstruct radio that</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.300" end="01:21:15.170" style="s2">affords us a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.160" end="01:21:16.820" style="s2">potentiality there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.170" end="01:21:18.560" style="s2">medium of that communication its</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.820" end="01:21:20.990" style="s2">capacity to network and thereby</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.560" end="01:21:22.910" style="s2">communicate things has been established</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.990" end="01:21:25.220" style="s2">already we have that knowledge structure</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.910" end="01:21:29.480" style="s2">and so we can do a lot with that medium</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.220" end="01:21:33.110" style="s2">of communication and of course what</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.480" end="01:21:35.570" style="s2">we&#39;re experiencing now is the continued</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.110" end="01:21:39.350" style="s2">emergence the rapid emergence of novel</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.570" end="01:21:41.180" style="s2">mediums of communication and as yet we I</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.350" end="01:21:42.560" style="s2">think are still adapting too well of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.180" end="01:21:45.320" style="s2">course we are still adapting as to how</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.560" end="01:21:46.430" style="s2">to like adaptively use through here</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.320" end="01:21:48.170" style="s2">we&#39;re currently destroying ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.430" end="01:21:49.460" style="s2">with these mediums of communication in</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.170" end="01:21:52.490" style="s2">terms of social media and what have you</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.460" end="01:21:55.340" style="s2">but yeah but such a beautiful thing we</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.490" end="01:21:57.350" style="s2">can talk to each other and what would it</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.340" end="01:22:00.820" style="s2">be like to and of course this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.350" end="01:22:06.130" style="s2">something I&#39;m very interested in to have</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.820" end="01:22:09.050" style="s2">six eight ten 20 50 100 more people</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.130" end="01:22:10.790" style="s2">networked together in conversation you</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.050" end="01:22:12.470" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have to limit it to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.790" end="01:22:14.210" style="s2">language actually we can use all four</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.470" end="01:22:16.880" style="s2">different forms of representation making</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.210" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">this is the this is the aim this is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.880" end="01:22:21.350" style="s2">vision and if we take this glass bead</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:23.960" style="s2">game example we have a fusion of a kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.350" end="01:22:27.080" style="s2">of maths and music and but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.960" end="01:22:30.200" style="s2">a commitment to playing the game in such</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.080" end="01:22:32.180" style="s2">a way as to enable something to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.200" end="01:22:34.490" style="s2">birthed from that collective</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.180" end="01:22:37.640" style="s2">participation right that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.490" end="01:22:39.170" style="s2">something beyond there kind of wealthy</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.640" end="01:22:41.600" style="s2">Union frame that you go it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.170" end="01:22:44.390" style="s2">identification with whatever&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.600" end="01:22:46.670" style="s2">the particular spotlight or that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.390" end="01:22:48.980" style="s2">lamppost of the ego but that we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.670" end="01:22:51.200" style="s2">subtly avail ourselves to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.980" end="01:22:53.740" style="s2">appropriate ingression with and</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.200" end="01:22:58.280" style="s2">relationships you and orbits of these</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.740" end="01:23:01.220" style="s2">these more nebulous more subtle features</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.280" end="01:23:04.350" style="s2">of ourselves and how what&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.220" end="01:23:09.210" style="s2">process what&#39;s the protocol</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.350" end="01:23:12.660" style="s2">for optimal collaboration in new mediums</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.210" end="01:23:18.180" style="s2">of communication it&#39;s in that landscape</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.660" end="01:23:21.300" style="s2">where I am most excited yeah that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.180" end="01:23:23.160" style="s2">that kind of I think crystallizes a very</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.300" end="01:23:25.470" style="s2">real opportunity that&#39;s in adjacent</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.160" end="01:23:27.540" style="s2">possible to us right now and although</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.470" end="01:23:28.890" style="s2">you know and and I and I would like</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.540" end="01:23:31.710" style="s2">obviously I mean I would love to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.890" end="01:23:34.850" style="s2">you many more times but I so much of</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.710" end="01:23:37.770" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is just firing off</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.850" end="01:23:39.630" style="s2">triggers in me of this person I know and</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.770" end="01:23:41.580" style="s2">this person I know who share a certain</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.630" end="01:23:43.020" style="s2">resonance would here be able to make a</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.580" end="01:23:45.270" style="s2">point and have something to add here</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.020" end="01:23:48.030" style="s2">that I can articulate but coming from</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.270" end="01:23:50.790" style="s2">them it would be that much crisper that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.030" end="01:23:53.750" style="s2">much more immediate more that&#39;s home the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.790" end="01:23:57.480" style="s2">rhythm it&#39;s like how can we show up</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.750" end="01:24:00.810" style="s2">bearing and with the what is ours to</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.480" end="01:24:03.150" style="s2">give to contribute to to this evolving</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.810" end="01:24:05.340" style="s2">harmony and the kind of ideas the</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.150" end="01:24:08.310" style="s2">insight the understanding what can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.340" end="01:24:11.910" style="s2">afforded through this such a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.310" end="01:24:14.460" style="s2">thing yeah so I mean to call back a</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.910" end="01:24:17.460" style="s2">little bit you know you made mention a</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.460" end="01:24:18.900" style="s2">while ago to this you know the concern</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.460" end="01:24:21.570" style="s2">that people have when they&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.900" end="01:24:23.030" style="s2">with self development but also when</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.570" end="01:24:25.260" style="s2">they&#39;re dealing with sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.030" end="01:24:27.330" style="s2">interpersonal self development right</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.260" end="01:24:29.460" style="s2">which is almost paradoxical except it</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.330" end="01:24:32.430" style="s2">isn&#39;t because we&#39;re connected to other</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.460" end="01:24:34.290" style="s2">people deeply and that&#39;s integral to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.430" end="01:24:38.400" style="s2">self development and self development is</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.290" end="01:24:41.340" style="s2">integral to relation and right you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.400" end="01:24:43.200" style="s2">and you expressed with no small concern</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.340" end="01:24:44.940" style="s2">I think some justification that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.200" end="01:24:47.460" style="s2">well what if what if you know we</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.940" end="01:24:49.230" style="s2">dissolve this thing down and we break it</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.460" end="01:24:50.640" style="s2">down and we build something back up but</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.230" end="01:24:52.260" style="s2">there&#39;s something left over of the old</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.640" end="01:24:56.370" style="s2">thing there&#39;s kind of an impurity that</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.260" end="01:24:59.820" style="s2">remains and it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.370" end="01:25:04.050" style="s2">understandable concern but also that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.820" end="01:25:07.050" style="s2">the work the problem often is that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.050" end="01:25:09.390" style="s2">have this mindset of sort of end-stage</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.050" end="01:25:13.950" style="s2">perfectionism and now we have achieved</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.390" end="01:25:16.590" style="s2">the perfect jewel right but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.950" end="01:25:18.159" style="s2">how it works it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s refinement</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.590" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">very often in fact this will</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.159" end="01:25:23.919" style="s2">that we crashed in our being at one</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:26.889" style="s2">phase of our life become the obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.919" end="01:25:29.110" style="s2">of another phase that&#39;s so common that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.889" end="01:25:31.269" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the bread and butter of</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.110" end="01:25:32.949" style="s2">the therapeutic practice in a way right</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.269" end="01:25:34.449" style="s2">you figure out solutions to problems and</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.949" end="01:25:35.979" style="s2">then later you have to dismantle them</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.449" end="01:25:37.989" style="s2">except they don&#39;t want to be dismantled</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.979" end="01:25:39.639" style="s2">and maybe you don&#39;t want to dismantle</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.989" end="01:25:41.079" style="s2">them but they&#39;re the things causing you</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.639" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">the problem it&#39;s like fixation and an</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.079" end="01:25:44.919" style="s2">insight problem you know you figured out</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:48.550" style="s2">how to connect the dots as a kid and now</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.919" end="01:25:51.459" style="s2">you can&#39;t solve the nine dot you know so</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.550" end="01:25:52.929" style="s2">so and that&#39;s a feature partly I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.459" end="01:25:56.439" style="s2">of what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.929" end="01:26:01.239" style="s2">you know John for Venky his close friend</p>

<p begin="01:27:22.329" end="01:27:26.469" style="s2">and they walk away and right but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.340" end="01:27:28.239" style="s2">what happens is that they connect so</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.469" end="01:27:30.340" style="s2">deeply that they begin to form an</p>

<p begin="01:27:31.929" end="01:27:34.900" style="s2">forth and they start to turn into</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.030" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">something new</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.900" end="01:27:39.310" style="s2">synoptic integration is the growth of</p>

<p begin="01:27:47.320" end="01:27:51.460" style="s2">interesting way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.119" end="01:27:52.929" style="s2">bringing together disparate fields and</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.460" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">cognitive sciences one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.929" end="01:27:55.449" style="s2">interdisciplinary things out there</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.159" end="01:27:55.929" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s one of the reasons I</p>

<p begin="01:27:55.929" end="01:27:59.800" style="s2">so you talk about anything and every</p>

<p begin="01:27:59.800" end="01:28:03.969" style="s2">discipline but cognitive science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.170" end="01:28:06.340" style="s2">the master disk unless the master</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.969" end="01:28:07.810" style="s2">discipline this alchemy but also as I</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.340" end="01:28:10.480" style="s2">argued recently cognitive science is</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.810" end="01:28:13.360" style="s2">Alchemy&#39;s yes oh but here&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.480" end="01:28:15.400" style="s2">that&#39;s all very abstract and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.360" end="01:28:18.760" style="s2">to grasp so here&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.400" end="01:28:21.580" style="s2">easier to grasp but that I often use the</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.760" end="01:28:23.440" style="s2">trick to getting this communication and</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.580" end="01:28:25.150" style="s2">symbolic exchange and all this cultural</p>

<p begin="01:28:30.760" end="01:28:35.920" style="s2">throw a good house party you can throw a</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.090" end="01:28:38.560" style="s2">house party and it can decay into</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:40.449" style="s2">generic to nominalism your one group of</p>

<p begin="01:28:42.520" end="01:28:46.420" style="s2">there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.590" end="01:28:48.160" style="s2">there&#39;s another group out here about</p>

<p begin="01:28:48.160" end="01:28:51.160" style="s2">each other and the point of a good house</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.870" end="01:28:54.850" style="s2">party of course is to bring together</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.160" end="01:28:56.950" style="s2">often to curate some disparate social</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.850" end="01:28:58.570" style="s2">streams of your friends and right or you</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.950" end="01:29:00.160" style="s2">might get a few meaningful jokes and</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.570" end="01:29:01.480" style="s2">maybe two of your friends to home with</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.160" end="01:29:03.610" style="s2">each other and you didn&#39;t expect that</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.480" end="01:29:05.500" style="s2">and you get some good conversations or</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.610" end="01:29:08.050" style="s2">whatever but then the groups fall back</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.500" end="01:29:10.590" style="s2">and you interact with them but then</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.050" end="01:29:14.050" style="s2">there&#39;s the house party where you</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.590" end="01:29:19.870" style="s2">succeed in setting the groundwork for</p>
