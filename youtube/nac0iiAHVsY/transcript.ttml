<p begin="00:11:04.250" end="00:11:11.690" style="s2">day the the sort of the the beckoning of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.390" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">that that that choral perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.690" end="00:11:17.930" style="s2">exists outside the bounded frame of her</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.330" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">someone noticing that deep deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.770" end="00:11:41.899" style="s2">that felt lack that manifests as as that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:46.279" style="s2">constant gesture to outside somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.899" end="00:11:51.880" style="s2">else noticing and that becomes one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.279" end="00:11:51.880" style="s2">interesting it becomes the they notice</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:12:01.850" style="s2">what&#39;s beyond her yes her and then she</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.709" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">probably feels seen yes so what scene is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.850" end="00:12:10.490" style="s2">what&#39;s somehow beyond her yes yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:13.520" style="s2">yes yes exactly there&#39;s that what is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.490" end="00:12:18.050" style="s2">is we&#39;re probably gonna read in a second</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.520" end="00:12:26.089" style="s2">yes yes what is it the Ianto it&#39;s a tomb</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.050" end="00:12:30.770" style="s2">intimation information kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.089" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and so she exactly in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.770" end="00:12:39.529" style="s2">certain sense in a way rations right</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:42.670" style="s2">toward that relationship she does right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.529" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">cuz that person she does the exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.670" end="00:12:49.190" style="s2">like that the after image or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">preimage almost is exactly because that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.190" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">because that person&#39;s perspective of her</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">relates not simply to her but relates to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:58.670" style="s2">her in potentia right relates to a force</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:01.010" style="s2">that verbalizes her from without that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.670" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">that remains in the margins of her</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.010" end="00:13:06.200" style="s2">possibility and that is what the person</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:08.120" style="s2">starts to attend to which is true of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.200" end="00:13:09.829" style="s2">close and intimate relationships even</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.120" end="00:13:12.290" style="s2">friendships right do that as well if</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.829" end="00:13:15.050" style="s2">someone sees you for what you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.290" end="00:13:18.110" style="s2">can become yeah in addition for who you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.050" end="00:13:20.709" style="s2">are by by constraints of your necessity</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.110" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">then already that means that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.709" end="00:13:26.389" style="s2">affordances of that relationship are</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:28.070" style="s2">multitudinous they amount to much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.389" end="00:13:30.199" style="s2">than what you are in the confines of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.070" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">actuality at any given moment which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.199" end="00:13:36.199" style="s2">how you know you have something really</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">valuable between you yeah so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.199" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;ve always had that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:44.120" style="s2">sense of people talk about encircling</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:49.579" style="s2">they talk about this experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.120" end="00:13:52.040" style="s2">deeply seen and like in kind of in being</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.579" end="00:13:56.180" style="s2">deeply see and they recognize the rarity</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.040" end="00:13:58.069" style="s2">of how scene deprived they&#39;ve been but</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.180" end="00:14:01.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve always had this sense of like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.069" end="00:14:03.139" style="s2">know scene seems to constitute this kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.370" end="00:14:05.660" style="s2">of sense of like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.139" end="00:14:07.850" style="s2">something that you are and that it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.660" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">not been visible to anybody and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.850" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">see it right but actually I never know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:16.250" style="s2">it&#39;s net it&#39;s that&#39;s not the experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:19.940" style="s2">of being seen on some level there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.250" end="00:14:23.209" style="s2">sense in which the thing it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.940" end="00:14:26.540" style="s2">like the very thing it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.209" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">reason why you do anything at all right</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.540" end="00:14:31.579" style="s2">that&#39;s actually concealed in its comings</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:33.860" style="s2">and goings and what people relate to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.579" end="00:14:38.510" style="s2">it&#39;s been it&#39;s being related to like oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.860" end="00:14:40.190" style="s2">I see what you couldn&#39;t have seen in</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.510" end="00:14:42.139" style="s2">yourself but you see it in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.190" end="00:14:44.360" style="s2">that I say it that has been the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.139" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">that has pulled you forward and then I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.360" end="00:14:51.940" style="s2">feel see it&#39;s very very hmm it also has</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">then because because then the the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.940" end="00:14:57.829" style="s2">the partners in the process become</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:15:00.470" style="s2">conspirators for its police&#39; second</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.829" end="00:15:04.279" style="s2">spire to pronounce it to reveal it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.470" end="00:15:06.230" style="s2">bring it forth and and and to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.279" end="00:15:09.079" style="s2">like they become causative of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.230" end="00:15:11.449" style="s2">way right even though it even though it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.079" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">lay already in the offing of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.449" end="00:15:16.069" style="s2">in that conversation they called it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:17.750" style="s2">forth they helped to verbalize it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.069" end="00:15:20.660" style="s2">kind of getting me it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.750" end="00:15:22.760" style="s2">because there is this quality and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.660" end="00:15:24.769" style="s2">is one of the things that the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.760" end="00:15:26.180" style="s2">circling practice has been like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.769" end="00:15:30.589" style="s2">struck me about</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.180" end="00:15:34.580" style="s2">what how people really consolidate when</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.589" end="00:15:37.760" style="s2">that they went out which is unseen is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:41.089" style="s2">coming to be seen there is this quality</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.760" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">where everyone is drawn in it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.089" end="00:15:46.730" style="s2">like they have to say it like everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:48.980" style="s2">drawn almost like uh it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.730" end="00:15:53.089" style="s2">kind of strange kind of prayer in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.980" end="00:15:54.649" style="s2">right in Clara t&#39;v sense that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.089" end="00:15:56.870" style="s2">goes into this sense where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.649" end="00:15:58.370" style="s2">looking at something and and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.870" end="00:16:02.390" style="s2">like there&#39;s this thing that&#39;s just out</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.370" end="00:16:07.520" style="s2">of concealment right and it must be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.390" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">there&#39;s like a month BC said yes oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.520" end="00:16:14.450" style="s2">and yeah exactly exactly and no it needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">us to be is to be informed with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.450" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">proper attention I mean it reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:21.200" style="s2">the it reminds me of the famous the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">famous metaphor that Platanias uses for</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.200" end="00:16:26.990" style="s2">sculpture right that that the treatment</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:30.770" style="s2">of one&#39;s soul that the crafting of one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.320" end="00:16:43.940" style="s2">you&#39;re ultimately doing is you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.589" style="s2">at least phenomenologically are working</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.940" end="00:16:48.740" style="s2">to pronounce something that it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.589" end="00:16:50.390" style="s2">there but concealed by its matter and so</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.650" end="00:17:02.150" style="s2">interior lee there&#39;s a process in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">and that is a dialectical and dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.150" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">process which maybe will segue into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">chapter but that&#39;s a dialogical process</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:14.750" style="s2">of pronunciation of the form that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:16.970" style="s2">there concealed beneath the concealed</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.750" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">beneath the forgetfulness concealed</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.970" end="00:17:23.660" style="s2">beneath forgotten and so that that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:25.339" style="s2">process of sculpting the process of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:48.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a chiasma they cross to those</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:50.210" style="s2">two processes intersect and the point at</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.500" end="00:17:51.320" style="s2">which they intersect is the point to</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.210" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">as we burrow more closely into ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.810" end="00:18:09.830" style="s2">that&#39;s retreating always we burrow into</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">what&#39;s most close to us that&#39;s the I</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.730" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">and what and that&#39;s directly that space</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.030" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s lost and his notion of the tech</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.040" end="00:18:41.890" style="s2">technological way of being right is</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.590" end="00:18:47.660" style="s2">concealment itself right we no longer</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.890" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">can can sense in other words it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.660" end="00:18:52.910" style="s2">kind of a hyper figure izing like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:55.190" style="s2">moment the background is at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.910" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">it&#39;s captured and utilized and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.190" end="00:19:00.380" style="s2">abstracted to the point where the only</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:03.170" style="s2">thing that we see as real is having</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.380" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">being is that which we can abstract out</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.170" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">of right or ground right so this sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:18.230" style="s2">of the presence of withdrawal or</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">concealment as a as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.230" end="00:19:23.870" style="s2">actually has being right is the very</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:28.460" style="s2">thing that&#39;s concealed so concealment</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.870" end="00:19:31.460" style="s2">its concealing right and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.460" end="00:19:35.350" style="s2">right the things that makes like we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.460" end="00:19:35.350" style="s2">talking about earlier about how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.380" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">there are just huge generational changes</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.350" end="00:19:45.770" style="s2">in in what we what designates as</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">counting as reality right it&#39;s in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.770" end="00:19:52.409" style="s2">it&#39;s happening so fast that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to even for the previous</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.409" end="00:19:56.519" style="s2">generation to conceive of that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">something&#39;s different right right</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.519" end="00:20:04.259" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a drastic change but</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:05.879" style="s2">but it&#39;s all all the change is when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.259" end="00:20:14.369" style="s2">step back from when you look at it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.879" end="00:20:17.399" style="s2">uncanny in its weirdness right but what</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.369" end="00:20:21.299" style="s2">makes it so uncanny is that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.399" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">Deker is uncanny like that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.299" end="00:20:27.330" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that loop of where where</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:32.039" style="s2">you don&#39;t know like it the the you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.330" end="00:20:34.289" style="s2">these life-changing you know inventions</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.039" end="00:20:36.419" style="s2">that happen like our phone and within</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.289" end="00:20:39.269" style="s2">like a maze you don&#39;t notice it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.419" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">and yet you&#39;re shaped and fashioned by</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.269" end="00:20:47.610" style="s2">it but that in fashioning of of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">actually conceals it right so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.610" end="00:20:52.440" style="s2">so interesting so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:54.690" style="s2">things I write that I I&#39;m excited and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.440" end="00:20:57.049" style="s2">think the reason why I keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.690" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">excited about what we&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.049" end="00:21:05.820" style="s2">that it seems like the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">dialogues are in some sense a you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.820" end="00:21:15.149" style="s2">if there&#39;s anybody that can hold open</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">concealment right and almost kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.149" end="00:21:20.129" style="s2">torture you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:23.100" style="s2">right Socrates right the right Huggle</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.129" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s holding open the aperture</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.100" end="00:21:30.059" style="s2">for the rest of us yeah so the light can</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:31.710" style="s2">come through yeah so there&#39;s a like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.059" end="00:21:34.049" style="s2">cave from the mouth of the cave as it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.710" end="00:21:36.149" style="s2">were-- right so this kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.049" end="00:21:39.590" style="s2">interesting to think about this like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.149" end="00:21:42.570" style="s2">here we are we&#39;re you and I are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.590" end="00:21:45.110" style="s2">read these dialogues that are 2,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.570" end="00:21:48.059" style="s2">years old or something over that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.110" end="00:21:50.549" style="s2">it&#39;s they&#39;re inherently gonna not be</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.059" end="00:21:54.230" style="s2">immediately entertaining right it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:56.490" style="s2">fact or yeah sort of entertaining and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.230" end="00:21:58.259" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a struggle and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.490" end="00:22:02.070" style="s2">gonna make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.259" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">yet imagining</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.070" end="00:22:10.590" style="s2">people encountering this and following</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:12.600" style="s2">along it&#39;s probably gonna strike it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.590" end="00:22:16.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna be so foreign</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.600" end="00:22:23.820" style="s2">to even see that is valuable right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.680" end="00:22:25.860" style="s2">I think so but but they&#39;re in it in some</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.820" end="00:22:27.510" style="s2">way it&#39;s kind of like the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.860" end="00:22:30.120" style="s2">technology in that sense it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.510" end="00:22:34.680" style="s2">collapsing distances it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.120" end="00:22:37.670" style="s2">wisdom finding wisdom right in precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.680" end="00:22:40.890" style="s2">what isn&#39;t immediately useful or</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.670" end="00:22:43.230" style="s2">immediately intelligible but right but</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.890" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">but in a certain sense that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.230" end="00:22:50.340" style="s2">being you know zeroing in on the figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">and in those moments opening the ground</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.340" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">in which was concealed and in realizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:58.500" style="s2">that going through that whole process</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:23:01.770" style="s2">that did that that the ground flashes</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.500" end="00:23:03.660" style="s2">forth right and that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.770" end="00:23:08.220" style="s2">the cultivation or the attunement to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.660" end="00:23:11.640" style="s2">wisdom right is really becoming rare and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.220" end="00:23:18.030" style="s2">rare and rare to even see that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.640" end="00:23:20.550" style="s2">process as virtuous yeah is yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.030" end="00:23:23.490" style="s2">really going away at a level that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.600" end="00:30:24.250" style="s2">anyway so that&#39;s kind of a little bit of</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:47.170" style="s2">the perspective of the parent is</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:57.579" style="s2">and so entrusting to the superordinate</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.810" end="00:48:17.820" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that can that can contain a</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.820" end="00:48:22.470" style="s2">contain yes and that you can ration you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.550" end="00:48:25.560" style="s2">can have a relationship to that which</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.470" end="00:48:29.340" style="s2">you can&#39;t totally understand but it can</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.560" end="00:48:31.830" style="s2">glow to you in such a way that it grants</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.830" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">so that would be an example the</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:38.130" style="s2">it seems like it would also be something</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.660" end="00:48:45.780" style="s2">right there&#39;s that quality of</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.780" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">they&#39;re so much more than in it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.900" end="00:48:57.030" style="s2">an awareness in fact the in love the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:59.220" style="s2">erotic impulse of diving in is seems to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.030" end="00:49:02.070" style="s2">be directly related to that there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.220" end="00:49:03.390" style="s2">much more than I can actually see right</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.070" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">yes right</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.390" end="00:49:08.220" style="s2">yeah ranking and the enactment of the</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.220" end="00:49:15.150" style="s2">are all in some sense that that sense of</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.150" end="00:49:22.050" style="s2">write be constituted by it yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.470" end="00:49:23.400" style="s2">right yeah your intra mural trusting</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.400" end="00:49:29.460" style="s2">transform you yeah right and that marks</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.030" end="00:49:30.660" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s Kierkegaard talked talked</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.460" end="00:49:32.820" style="s2">about that a little bit when he talks</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.660" end="00:49:34.290" style="s2">but is sort of his night of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.820" end="00:49:36.630" style="s2">the night of faith right that at some</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.290" end="00:49:38.850" style="s2">point you reach a threshold beyond which</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.630" end="00:49:42.090" style="s2">you can no longer reliably gather and</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.090" end="00:49:50.460" style="s2">then the the process of the ontological</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.460" end="00:49:58.470" style="s2">what is in what is unbounded is sort of</p>

<p begin="00:50:03.090" end="00:50:05.820" style="s2">is what makes it subject to</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.190" end="00:50:15.360" style="s2">right and then it beyond which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.080" end="00:50:16.890" style="s2">can no longer see clearly is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.360" end="00:50:18.030" style="s2">precisely the question and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.890" end="00:50:18.630" style="s2">the training on the education the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.030" end="00:50:20.430" style="s2">mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.630" end="00:50:23.130" style="s2">right that&#39;s why Socrates is the</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.849" end="00:50:33.930" style="s2">talk about this later in the paper too</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.589" end="00:50:38.029" style="s2">right but from one proposition to</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.569" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">earns the trust of his interlocutors so</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.200" end="00:50:53.130" style="s2">that when he dissolves their dialo goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:55.789" style="s2">into a pariah and moves to effect the</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.329" end="00:51:32.490" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s a innit yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.230" end="00:51:35.279" style="s2">one of the things that just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:36.930" style="s2">struck me is is there&#39;s a move that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.279" end="00:51:40.220" style="s2">happened inside of me and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.930" end="00:51:42.589" style="s2">this what is if I can&#39;t articulate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.220" end="00:51:44.759" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.589" end="00:51:47.640" style="s2">respond to what&#39;s beyond the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.759" end="00:51:51.420" style="s2">that I can&#39;t that isn&#39;t I can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.640" end="00:51:53.579" style="s2">object but then but it&#39;s it that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.420" end="00:51:56.069" style="s2">could be very self deceptive so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.579" end="00:51:58.680" style="s2">another thing to have the wisdom to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.069" end="00:52:01.910" style="s2">able to another that&#39;s fascinating like</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.910" end="00:52:12.450" style="s2">apprehend on some level what thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:17.069" style="s2">I can&#39;t make object is the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.450" end="00:52:19.740" style="s2">that will lead me to the like a wise</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.069" end="00:52:23.130" style="s2">place like that&#39;s there leads a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.740" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">other level of education in it right</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.130" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s funny I&#39;m I&#39;m I got I get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:28.890" style="s2">of that there&#39;s you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:32.310" style="s2">things about our time is like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:35.550" style="s2">big loss of mentorship for the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.310" end="00:52:37.560" style="s2">right we&#39;re right there is it there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.550" end="00:52:39.660" style="s2">this quality having been mentored myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.560" end="00:52:41.370" style="s2">there is this quality of where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.660" end="00:52:43.800" style="s2">kind of like what they&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.370" end="00:52:45.090" style="s2">Metra saying to you explicitly right</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.800" end="00:52:47.220" style="s2">they&#39;re telling you you know where to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.090" end="00:52:48.810" style="s2">put your hands and how to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.220" end="00:52:50.970" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole other level of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.810" end="00:52:52.770" style="s2">the way that they&#39;re participating with</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.970" end="00:52:55.890" style="s2">you and the participation that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.770" end="00:52:59.490" style="s2">called that there&#39;s like a meta there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.890" end="00:53:01.950" style="s2">a meta intelligibility to the way that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.490" end="00:53:04.530" style="s2">they use their hands the way the depth</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.950" end="00:53:06.690" style="s2">you that are somehow in the background</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.530" end="00:53:09.840" style="s2">but end up being the very thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.690" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">gives you the right ability that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.840" end="00:53:15.480" style="s2">write because later usually a lot later</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:17.670" style="s2">that you can then attribute it to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.480" end="00:53:20.040" style="s2">that mentor that mentorship that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.670" end="00:53:22.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a patient element of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.040" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">exactly exactly participate that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.440" end="00:53:31.880" style="s2">participatory element of it is itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:35.190" style="s2">its itself enabled by the dramaturgy of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.880" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">like the I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.190" end="00:53:40.260" style="s2">why there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">mimetic process in play with these</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.260" end="00:53:44.250" style="s2">dialogues right that&#39;s the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:46.830" style="s2">internalizing the sage internalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.250" end="00:53:50.100" style="s2">socratic figure isn&#39;t isn&#39;t that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.830" end="00:53:53.460" style="s2">simply isn&#39;t that you&#39;ve been you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.100" end="00:53:55.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not simply that the the mode</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.460" end="00:53:58.830" style="s2">of inquiry is conferred on you it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.800" end="00:54:01.860" style="s2">the manner and the attitudinal come like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.830" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">the composure of the inquiry is also</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.860" end="00:54:05.880" style="s2">conferred on you and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:10.040" style="s2">dramaturgical because you&#39;re playing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:13.350" style="s2">role it&#39;s the playing of the role that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.040" end="00:54:16.890" style="s2">espouses the training of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.350" end="00:54:21.020" style="s2">right it&#39;s stepping into of what Falls</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.890" end="00:54:24.660" style="s2">of the socratic figure right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.020" end="00:54:26.340" style="s2">simply that you&#39;re because you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.660" end="00:54:28.530" style="s2">it&#39;s something it&#39;s something deeper</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.340" end="00:54:29.850" style="s2">than whatever whatever straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.530" end="00:54:33.330" style="s2">instruction you&#39;re given it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.850" end="00:54:37.650" style="s2">attitudinal absorption of the person</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.330" end="00:54:41.190" style="s2">yeah that grants you the latitude in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.650" end="00:54:43.740" style="s2">your own identity to be able to assume</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.190" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">and host ever more of their</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.740" end="00:54:50.550" style="s2">perspective assume right host Wow</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:53.220" style="s2">interesting right so playing the role of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.550" end="00:54:55.410" style="s2">Socrates and I mean this godless this</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.220" end="00:54:57.060" style="s2">happened and and an artists tend to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.410" end="00:55:00.600" style="s2">report this a lot right I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.060" end="00:55:02.970" style="s2">authors who are writing characters or</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.600" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">actors that are playing a character on</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.970" end="00:55:09.600" style="s2">stage often report the fact that when if</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:11.880" style="s2">they&#39;re if they&#39;re if they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.600" end="00:55:14.040" style="s2">flow state I should qualify that to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.880" end="00:55:17.060" style="s2">if they&#39;re in the flow state and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.040" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2">playing a certain character whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.060" end="00:55:22.440" style="s2">whether simply giving voice in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:24.750" style="s2">literary medium or actually embodying a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.440" end="00:55:28.350" style="s2">character in a theatrical medium they</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.750" end="00:55:31.230" style="s2">find themselves suddenly equipped to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.350" end="00:55:33.480" style="s2">speak with a voice that resounds beyond</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.230" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">their own in other words they can</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.480" end="00:55:39.420" style="s2">conceive as the character can conceive</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:41.430" style="s2">and as they could not outside the bounds</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.420" end="00:55:43.260" style="s2">of the character right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.430" end="00:55:45.270" style="s2">something about the process of play and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.260" end="00:55:47.880" style="s2">I mean a lot of people right from Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.270" end="00:55:50.190" style="s2">onward developmentally talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.880" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">role of this and how important it is and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.190" end="00:55:55.710" style="s2">how indispensable it is but that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:58.230" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s also I mean as if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.710" end="00:56:04.050" style="s2">need something to dignify and qualify</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.230" end="00:56:07.050" style="s2">how vital those kinds of art forms are</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.050" end="00:56:10.380" style="s2">to us because the art forms that allow</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.050" end="00:56:13.290" style="s2">us to extend identification are the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.380" end="00:56:16.680" style="s2">artful forms that actually allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.290" end="00:56:18.990" style="s2">condition the sense of play that endow</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.680" end="00:56:20.730" style="s2">us with the capacity to seek self</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.990" end="00:56:22.800" style="s2">transformation genuinely on</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.730" end="00:56:25.410" style="s2">authentically because it prevents the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.800" end="00:56:27.450" style="s2">ossification of identity that happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.410" end="00:56:29.700" style="s2">when we&#39;re constantly vacillating from</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.450" end="00:56:32.250" style="s2">the first to the third person if I am</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.700" end="00:56:34.590" style="s2">simply an object I own to be possessed</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.250" end="00:56:37.050" style="s2">or dispossessed of that I will not be</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.590" end="00:56:39.060" style="s2">ever verbalized from without in a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.050" end="00:56:41.550" style="s2">that seems spontaneous and unanticipated</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.060" end="00:56:44.070" style="s2">and it is the spontaneous and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.550" end="00:56:46.109" style="s2">unanticipated emergence of oneself in</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.070" end="00:56:48.660" style="s2">the throes of something ritual in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.109" end="00:56:52.050" style="s2">throes of something poetic and creative</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.660" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">that rebirths the potential of how we</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.050" end="00:56:58.010" style="s2">can understand ourselves and anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:01.730" style="s2">large right again the gnosis the gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.010" end="00:57:04.370" style="s2">is inseminated by the play and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.730" end="00:57:06.110" style="s2">why the Platonic dialogues or dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.370" end="00:57:07.670" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons clearly why</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.110" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">the platonic dialogues are dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.670" end="00:57:12.860" style="s2">because they ritualized the dramaturgy</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">of role play that is actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.860" end="00:57:16.040" style="s2">for the acquisition of the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:20.540" style="s2">persona so that we can actually act</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.040" end="00:57:22.340" style="s2">through it appropriately yeah that&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.540" end="00:57:27.800" style="s2">so interesting I just did this thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.340" end="00:57:32.750" style="s2">about hosting host the role it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.800" end="00:57:35.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like I can host a party right in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.750" end="00:57:38.330" style="s2">certain sense like I can host a party</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.180" end="00:57:42.310" style="s2">and have people come over that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.330" end="00:57:45.980" style="s2">yet I&#39;m yet not yet capable of I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.310" end="00:57:49.880" style="s2">yet capable of knowing how to host but</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.980" end="00:57:53.870" style="s2">in the hosting I&#39;m drawn forth into</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.880" end="00:57:57.050" style="s2">realizing conversations and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.870" end="00:57:59.300" style="s2">intelligibility in like in this way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.050" end="00:58:01.700" style="s2">I will consciously probably say oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.300" end="00:58:05.240" style="s2">I learned this I learned that but yet it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.700" end="00:58:07.970" style="s2">will come through at levels that I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.240" end="00:58:09.410" style="s2">recognize you know after I host parties</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.970" end="00:58:12.560" style="s2">after that right there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.410" end="00:58:15.620" style="s2">that&#39;s right being impregnated with well</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.560" end="00:58:19.070" style="s2">the sense of a potential or a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.620" end="00:58:23.330" style="s2">possibility that on some level I can I</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.070" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">can apprehend is worth it to host it yet</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.330" end="00:58:31.310" style="s2">the that in some way yes that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:34.490" style="s2">the host becomes becomes what&#39;s hosted</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.310" end="00:58:36.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s right you&#39;re you are played</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.490" end="00:58:38.180" style="s2">by the role that you&#39;re also playing you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.980" end="00:58:39.980" style="s2">are played by the role that you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.180" end="00:58:42.530" style="s2">playing and that and then the way that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.980" end="00:58:44.770" style="s2">you comport you&#39;re you the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.530" end="00:58:49.400" style="s2">comport yourself and your credulity</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.770" end="00:58:52.730" style="s2">towards that role yeah I think also</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.400" end="00:58:55.070" style="s2">matters because then if you if you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.730" end="00:58:55.670" style="s2">if you overplay the role as it were or</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.300" end="01:10:14.730" style="s2">dwell in the get this it&#39;s a I just it I</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.679" end="01:10:18.929" style="s2">think I&#39;m appreciating why you know why</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.730" end="01:10:21.329" style="s2">Heidegger like first tried to go into</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.929" end="01:10:23.719" style="s2">this in terms of temporality because</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.329" end="01:10:30.449" style="s2">it&#39;s totally yeah it&#39;s an ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.719" end="01:10:32.489" style="s2">temporalities so much more apt to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.449" end="01:10:36.059" style="s2">accurately um</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.489" end="01:10:39.179" style="s2">reckon with us that our being like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.059" end="01:10:39.869" style="s2">sign human being right is source not</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.179" end="01:10:41.789" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.869" end="01:10:45.449" style="s2">got to look at this in terms of an</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.789" end="01:10:48.750" style="s2">animai kind of subject in a space that</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.449" end="01:10:51.179" style="s2">then acts it&#39;s like that stuff just</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.750" end="01:10:53.210" style="s2">falls apart when you get when you when</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.179" end="01:10:56.309" style="s2">you look at it what is it to actually be</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.210" end="01:10:57.659" style="s2">right there&#39;s like some level and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.309" end="01:11:01.949" style="s2">think there&#39;s some history to this too</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.659" end="01:11:06.500" style="s2">because my understanding this you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.949" end="01:11:10.260" style="s2">if we say that Hegel was the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.500" end="01:11:11.579" style="s2">culmination of a system right like one</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.260" end="01:11:13.650" style="s2">of the things that you Hannes I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.579" end="01:11:16.199" style="s2">appreciated about johannes is like how</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.650" end="01:11:18.840" style="s2">he says like look you can&#39;t that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.199" end="01:11:22.440" style="s2">can&#39;t add anything to Hegel system right</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.840" end="01:11:25.289" style="s2">and no no no it&#39;s immaculate it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.440" end="01:11:28.289" style="s2">matter yeah and it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.289" end="01:11:32.340" style="s2">culmination of the actual trumping the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.289" end="01:11:37.170" style="s2">possible and right in in a sense it</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.340" end="01:11:39.510" style="s2">missus right conceals right and so in</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.170" end="01:11:41.519" style="s2">some way there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.510" end="01:11:45.630" style="s2">slipping that back out and if we say no</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.519" end="01:11:49.469" style="s2">way but possible is what animates yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.630" end="01:11:51.690" style="s2">live to be way more animates animates is</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.469" end="01:11:53.820" style="s2">the perfect word for it right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.690" end="01:11:57.690" style="s2">imbuing with Animas the imbuing with</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.820" end="01:12:01.380" style="s2">soul it&#39;s the gilding it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.690" end="01:12:03.599" style="s2">the it&#39;s the enchantment of actuality by</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.380" end="01:12:05.039" style="s2">possibility added curricular costs cause</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.599" end="01:12:07.590" style="s2">it&#39;s something like a transubstantiation</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.039" end="01:12:10.080" style="s2">of experience that the way in which</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.590" end="01:12:12.540" style="s2">we read actuality it&#39;s a it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
