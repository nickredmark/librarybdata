<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:09.040" style="s2">hey everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:10.480" style="s2">so this is the latest film in our sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.040" end="00:00:12.080" style="s2">making series</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.480" end="00:00:13.599" style="s2">all about the problem of truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">digital age</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.599" end="00:00:17.039" style="s2">so if the last couple of films were</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:17.840" style="s2">about the failure of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.039" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">this is about the alternative media the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">hopes and the failure conditions of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">in particular this is about</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:31.599" style="s2">how we split into warring tribes online</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">how that tribalism is enforced and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.599" end="00:00:34.880" style="s2">we might be able to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">introducing some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.880" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">frameworks and also talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">mimetic mediation between the different</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:42.320" style="s2">online tribes</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s also about where some really</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.320" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">important things seem to be shifting</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">on the front lines of the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">and the biggest frame as i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2">said before</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">is that i feel that we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">interregnum period between two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the accelerated collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">the existing structures</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">particularly the sense-making structures</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">but we don&#39;t yet have a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">network solution to the problem of truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">you could imagine that we might have one</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">but right now we&#39;re in this kind of no</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.479" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">and if the previous films were really</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">about the the problems and the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">accelerated collapse of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">this is what are the failure conditions</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">of the alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">and is there anything that we might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">able to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">and hopefully there&#39;s a few signs of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">hope in this film</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">so the first couple of films really</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">looked at the crisis in journalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">how it was increasingly being replaced</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">with activism</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">and ideological conformity so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">going to look much more closely at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">alternative media the online media</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">and in a way the problem is worse there</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">because most online sites don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">really aim for balance they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">aim for</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">showing both sides of the story and as</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">tristan harris explained in the recent</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">film that we put out</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">that&#39;s because the incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">of the online world</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">actually selects for polarization</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">division and fixed ideas to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">attention within that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">that sphere i have to use outrage so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">both sides the left and the right are</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">outrage to get people to get to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">people&#39;s attention that&#39;s what causes</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">this kind of what we call the race to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">the bottom of the brain stem</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">for attention so what it also selects</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">for is a type of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">that relies on ridicule it relies on</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">dunking</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">it relies on bad faith and bad faith is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">something i&#39;m going to come to in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">topic because i think we desperately</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">need a definition of what bad faith is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just a subjective judgment</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:34.040" style="s2">that means i don&#39;t have to talk to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">person we don&#39;t have to talk to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.040" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">and we&#39;ve covered the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">web on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">program before quite a lot because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">was deliberately set up</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">to be a place beyond that polarization</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">spiral a place with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">a certain type of good faith</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">argumentation i&#39;ve also explained why i</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">think it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">fell short of those aims and where it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">got stuck</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">and turned into a bit of a tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">itself but why i was really excited</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">when the intellectual dark web was first</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">named in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">was i&#39;d seen the collapse of journalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">accelerated by the digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">wave and this was the first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">emergent phenomenon that looked like it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">might be trying to tackle the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">the idea that someone like joe rogan</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">like sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">like dave rubin they had found a niche</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">outside the mainstream outside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">traditional media and they&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">very popular so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">it was a genuine emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">they&#39;d sort of grown in the cracks</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">left by the mainstream media by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">traditional media but i think if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">even going to start to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">problem we have to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">going on at a much deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">than just the surface conflict we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">to understand how for example the tech</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">platforms are leveraging the lower</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">angels of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">as tristan harris explained there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">race to the bottom of the brain stem</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">looking for limbic hijack looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">polarization looking for outrage</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even in a way it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">tech platform&#39;s fault because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">an incentive structure where if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">not doing it then one of their</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">competitors is going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">and ultimately what it&#39;s showing up is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">that we are in a self-terminating system</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">the underlying dynamics that are leading</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">to the self-termination that people feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">and sense right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">are not different in kind than the ones</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">sort of worldviews and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">these mathematic tribes are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">combating with each other and all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">odd alliances are forming</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">and the overall theme of the piece was</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">that the old culture war which could</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">easily be split into left and right</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">was now fragmenting into a multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">war i think you can see that that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">of the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">intense conflicts are between people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">are theoretically on the same side</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">the example of barry weiss at the new</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">york times being a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">i mean parry barry weiss was a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">most things that other people in the new</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">york times would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">but they were split on this central</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">culture war issue of whether the woke</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">left had gone too far or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">and that was the central that was by far</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">the most heated division</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">there&#39;s conservative columnists at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">new york times they don&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">anywhere near as much heat as barry</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">weiss</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">received while she was there as she</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">explained in her</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">resignation letter the level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">animosity towards her was just extreme</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">so the key to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">landscape of mimetic tribes is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">understand that each one</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">has some part of the truth they are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">often right about the certain part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">the map that they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">but in a way it&#39;s like the blind man and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">the elephant there&#39;s all these blind men</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">they&#39;re touching an elephant</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">and they view their point on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">elephant where they&#39;re touching either</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">the trunk or</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">or the tail as their reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">and what the good thing about that is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re hyper focused on that area</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">they feel the texture they can smell it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">and that affords them ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">things that we might not</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">otherwise see if we weren&#39;t touching</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">that spot but the problem is is that if</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">you just view</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">that spot as the entirety of reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">then you&#39;re in trouble you need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">the idea was an invitation to the reader</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">to look at it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">and i view this this this whole whole</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">frame that this is a multipolar almost</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">the mimetic tribe that you belong to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">alongside all these other memetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">that might jog you out of uh your belief</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">system just for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">and then he introduces this concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">which i think is absolutely central to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">navigating this culture war</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">of mimetic mediation between the tribes</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">2020 is proving to be a remarkable year</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">picture emerging and i suppose the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">to do is just to figure out whether we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">can make any useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">sense of it yeah i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">i think um the the first place for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">that that&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">uh i think a lot of us in journalism um</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">are coming around slowly to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">that we we missed</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">some big stories that took place uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">on campuses a few years ago um</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">you know yours the obviously the one in</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">yale</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">uh but really you know we&#39;ve heard from</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">academics</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">over the years about certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">were going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">and we i think the the reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">reaction among most people in the press</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">and most of us are kind of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">leaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">in our political orientation um</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">was to say okay well that&#39;s a right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">talking point</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">and you know we&#39;re gonna have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">selling that story anyway if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">and so let&#39;s not even bother</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">and uh so there was a combination of not</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">taking it seriously and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">little bit of like cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">already working in</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">into the thought process with</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">journalists because we just knew that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get that past editors</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">right um but now</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">you know this is this has come into our</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">business in a huge way</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">uh in particular in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">months as you know so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">um you know people like me i think oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:45.120" style="s2">people like you an apology</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">for coming around to this late if</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.120" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">yeah well i have a uh a rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">when it comes to such things</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">which is i welcome anybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">without the need for an apology who</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">recognizes that they got it wrong</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on is that when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:37.919" style="s2">any large collection of people to salute</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">a nonsensical flag and pledge allegiance</p>

<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">and more or less everyone makes the</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.400" style="s2">i guess if this is going to get me</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">through my day i&#39;ll salute any flag</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got the one gal or one guy</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">well my observation is that that person</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">is usually sitting on an entire</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">mountain of interesting thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">they</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">readjustment and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">perspective yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">in general if you ask a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">to salute a flag that makes no sense and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">tell them that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">they&#39;ll be incentivized you&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">thousand dollar check at the end or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">you know you won&#39;t lose your job and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">somebody stands up</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">and says no way i&#39;m getting out of here</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">do what you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">that person is usually much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">interesting than just being a contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">that person is usually saying no because</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve got an entire world view</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">that is uh built by hand and and bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">this method of finding people has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">relatively fruitful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">people who don&#39;t back down usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">back down for a reason because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">every reason just to go along</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">and just a couple of days ago mata</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:22.360" style="s2">resulted in a bunch of dissociated</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">is what arrived with the scientific</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">a single perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">green is what fully arrived in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">post-modernism or multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">and the positive side of that was the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">introduced things that were not seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">from the orange perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">it introduced the voices of people who&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">and that was a really positive</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">development but what happened with green</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">and the danger of green and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">become so toxic</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">and effectively dysfunctional as a</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">was that it insisted that all there was</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">was multiple perspectives and that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">was no truth</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s all an interpretation it all</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">i just said</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">that represents the green point of view</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">it maintains that its view is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">culturally constructed</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s true for all people at all places</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">at all time</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not a matter of interpretation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">got real</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">truth nobody else has truth because</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">objective truth doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">but that view itself is held to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">objectively true by the postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">so they do get caught up in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">enormous kind of contradiction so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">integral shows is that green has to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">integrate orange values to be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">what it&#39;s actually been doing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">attacking orange values</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">green succeeded in the 60s because it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">rested on orange values</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">it fought for free speech it insisted on</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">the rights of everyone to be heard</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what actually allowed the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">green revolution in civil rights and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">different areas of the culture to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">succeed but what&#39;s going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">is that green is now attacking denying</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">and shutting down free speech in too</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">many different areas</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s effectively like it&#39;s soaring</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">off the branch that it&#39;s resting on</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">which is incredibly incredibly dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing things like that playing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">out in the culture for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">this tweet from the writer charles blow</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">which only works if you assume that your</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">views are going to be dominant in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">workplace and they&#39;re only going to be</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">reprehensible bigots but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">same justification that would allow</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">someone to be sacked for being</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">completely short sight of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing genuine liberals who</p>
