<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">is it naturally like why children start</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">to hate things that they&#39;ve outgrown</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">instead of just being like I think some</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">of them are probably like me but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">ones that do why it&#39;s if you hate no I</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">like whether it&#39;s actually a biological</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">mechanism so that they and then it also</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">got me thinking about exes that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">like love someone and then it turns into</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">hate and I&#39;ve never really experienced</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">that I don&#39;t kind of angry at someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">but if I love you I love you forever</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">there&#39;s not like it&#39;s it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">love but it&#39;s love and so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">if I just don&#39;t have that peace but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">also and whether it&#39;s tied together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">a good question I have no idea mike says</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">asking people on facebook about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">exact thing and they are explaining or</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">saying things so well I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">chiming in and that also sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">that&#39;s anyway they&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">very issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">what ageism and my Dorothy exploring it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">and why does the kids hate it but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">also very much a society put into kids</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">that being a baby is bad that like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">babies do that you don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">some babies do and I remember being a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">kid and I really enjoyed certain things</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">like dolls and I played with them with</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">my older sister and then I played with</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">them or like the equivalent with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">younger brother because he wouldn&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">dolls with me so they played like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">ours but like they were dolls and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">he outgrew it even though he&#39;s younger</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2">than me he all grew that first probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">because I think he didn&#39;t like the play</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">with dolls aspect of it and then but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">even my friend group people like my peer</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:34.740" style="s2">group like I too convinced them in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:36.330" style="s2">different ways and I did it fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.740" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">decent job of live but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.330" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">always a one-off like it was like I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">a big peer group in grade six and like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">one person would come over and play with</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:47.250" style="s2">me with dolls but we wouldn&#39;t his school</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">was like not allowed to be talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.250" end="00:02:51.600" style="s2">because we were all too old to play with</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">them and annoyed they were all at each</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.600" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">other&#39;s houses doing that too which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">another weird thing like why we require</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">kids to grow up in that way like who</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">cares if I was still playing with dolls</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:08.040" style="s2">like the whole time I&#39;ve been like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:09.240" style="s2">we think that&#39;s weird but why because</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.040" end="00:03:11.460" style="s2">there becomes a point when you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.240" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">naturally let them go but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.460" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">forced to let them go I think you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">hold on to that I don&#39;t know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:22.110" style="s2">matter if you learn to the more that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s why not let everyone grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.110" end="00:03:25.580" style="s2">into and out of things on their own and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">not have attributed to age at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.580" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">including a lot of thing like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:31.020" style="s2">know would there still be people sucking</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">on bottles and sue theirs when they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.020" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">like 30 if we just left them I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">know people who absolutely could use the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">washroom but didn&#39;t because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">things that are rather inconvenient as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:52.170" style="s2">parent that you end up using that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:53.670" style="s2">language on I don&#39;t think I have used</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.170" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">that language but my kid watches a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.670" end="00:04:00.110" style="s2">of TV so it&#39;s not like she&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">insulated entity if it&#39;s only had my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.110" end="00:04:05.550" style="s2">experience on her me teaching her from</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:09.240" style="s2">on high she&#39;s very much a product of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.550" end="00:04:10.920" style="s2">culture but a conscious product of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.240" end="00:04:12.420" style="s2">culture too she has me as a parent so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.920" end="00:04:14.520" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.420" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">everything that happens and how there</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.520" end="00:04:21.720" style="s2">sexism and racism also she&#39;s allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">enjoy shows so he sounds like like she</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like and that&#39;s not true she</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:26.260" style="s2">loves watch it yeah I don&#39;t like watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:27.670" style="s2">it with her but when we watch together</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.260" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">I know I heard as I point out all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.670" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">thee all of those type of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">everybody neighbors coming in ageism</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:58.030" style="s2">remember taking a class about different</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">kinds of privilege I want different kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.030" end="00:05:03.310" style="s2">of privileges we have and age is the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">privilege that you start out as in light</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.310" end="00:05:07.990" style="s2">like you go from privilege to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:09.220" style="s2">non-privileged the other way around not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.990" end="00:05:13.750" style="s2">privileged to privileged and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.220" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">unprivileged and that is a unique like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.750" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">we think babies and children are cute</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">but we are very a dressed towards them</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">we require them to like act in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">they aren&#39;t capable of but even more so</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.500" end="00:05:29.830" style="s2">than they&#39;re not capable of like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:32.020" style="s2">not capable of and we expect it from</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">them I mean I do it all the time even</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:35.410" style="s2">like even though I know I still do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.410" end="00:05:40.900" style="s2">but it is cuz I&#39;m not capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:43.780" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been aware of that means I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.900" end="00:05:45.040" style="s2">less I can that place as a parent like</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.780" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">you should be able to do this even</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.040" end="00:05:49.660" style="s2">though I can&#39;t do it why can&#39;t you do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:51.910" style="s2">then when I do just let her emerge I&#39;m</p>
