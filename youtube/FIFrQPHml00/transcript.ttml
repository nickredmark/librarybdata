<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.490" style="s2">so hi my name is Joe brewer and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.760" end="00:00:08.700" style="s2">change strategist and today I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.490" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">a book review on this amazing book right</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">here butterfly economics by Paul Ormerod</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">the subtitle is a new general theory of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">social and economic behavior and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">book would fit into the category of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">I would call complexity economics</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">meaning that Paul is taking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">perspective informed by complexity</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">science to explain how economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:37.890" style="s2">work and what&#39;s really excellent about</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">this book is he flips traditional</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:42.090" style="s2">economic theory on its head now</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">traditional economic theory I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.090" end="00:00:47.340" style="s2">referring to what&#39;s called neoclassical</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">economics which looks at economic</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.340" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">systems as complete Gestalt so there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">an economy as a monolithic thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:57.899" style="s2">look at its behavior as a monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">thing and you have assumptions about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.899" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">it works and for those of you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">studied the history of economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">scholarship you&#39;ll know that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">major assumptions of neoclassical</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">economics have been falsified they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:13.979" style="s2">don&#39;t hold up to the scrutiny of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">observational experience and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.979" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">question that Paul is asking is what if</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">we were to instead look at economics</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">from the bottom up and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">looking at it as a monolithic uniform</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">thing look at it as a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">small interacting agents that have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">relationship to each other and see how</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">those interactions between a large</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">number of small entities can create the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">emergent macro scale behavior that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">see in economic systems and so he does</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">this by starting with some fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">research that&#39;s been done with ant</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">colonies where they would take a colony</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">of ants and give them to food supplies</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:58.020" style="s2">that are equally distant from each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">so if you were to imagine that right</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.020" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">here is where the colony is and then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">were to go from it to two locations</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">where there&#39;s a pile of sugar say and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">you watch as ants go out to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">food supplies and leave their little</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:11.790" style="s2">Chemical trails to tell the other ants</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:14.129" style="s2">whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.790" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2">food you&#39;ll see this fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.129" end="00:02:20.909" style="s2">emergent dynamic that at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.180" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">time there will be a majority like</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.909" end="00:02:24.920" style="s2">eighty percent of the ants will have</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:27.689" style="s2">gone over to the pile that&#39;s over here</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:29.609" style="s2">but then at another time rather abruptly</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.689" end="00:02:31.439" style="s2">eighty percent will switched and gone</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.609" end="00:02:33.989" style="s2">over to the pile that&#39;s over here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.439" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">there&#39;s this chaotic back and forth they</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.989" end="00:02:38.099" style="s2">never stabilize into one pile or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:39.989" style="s2">other and if you were to take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.099" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">average across the large amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.989" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">you find that the ants spend about half</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.650" style="s2">their time at each of the piles but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">that&#39;s not really a useful measure for</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:53.489" style="s2">the amazing complexity and details</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:55.169" style="s2">granular instability and chaos the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.489" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">turbulence latest scene in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.169" end="00:02:59.189" style="s2">behavior dance if you take the same way</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:01.829" style="s2">of thinking and apply it to economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.189" end="00:03:04.260" style="s2">systems and look at say the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.829" end="00:03:06.269" style="s2">different firms behave in an economy</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.260" end="00:03:08.359" style="s2">where there are some firms that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.269" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">small and they&#39;re rapidly growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.359" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">disrupting with new technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:15.209" style="s2">are causing other firms to go extinct or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">to go bankrupt and close their doors</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.209" end="00:03:19.199" style="s2">where there are firms that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">interacting with each other to merge and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.199" end="00:03:23.849" style="s2">form conglomerates or to be divided and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">broken off and sold as pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.849" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">they&#39;re all these interacting patterns</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">that arise the behaviors between the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:33.739" style="s2">different firms and when you look at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:36.419" style="s2">of those interacting behaviors together</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.739" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">you&#39;re able to see an emergent pattern</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.419" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">of behavior which is the overall</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">behavior of the economic system so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:44.849" style="s2">taking this way of thinking of looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:47.099" style="s2">at economies as a bunch of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.849" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">agents who have some rules that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.099" end="00:03:50.129" style="s2">determine what their likely strategies</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:52.949" style="s2">are and how they interact with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.129" end="00:03:55.220" style="s2">other that you can run modeling and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.949" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">simulation studies using a computer to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.220" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">see the behaviors that pop out and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:02.819" style="s2">have some fascinating examples from</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:04.590" style="s2">economic policy that look at social</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.819" end="00:04:08.359" style="s2">issues and one that I found especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.590" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">compelling was a discussion he had about</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.359" end="00:04:14.009" style="s2">policies that are intended to increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">public safety by reducing crime on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.009" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">streets and what he showed was that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">certain economic conditions where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">have a measure of seiya a ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:26.660" style="s2">rate of some kind of crime like</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:28.970" style="s2">the people breaking into houses that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.660" end="00:04:30.680" style="s2">you introduce a certain policy into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.970" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2">environment it will reduce the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:35.000" style="s2">crime but in another situation that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:37.180" style="s2">a different set of background conditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">where the crime rate is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.180" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">meaning that ten percent of the houses</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">are being broken into in a given period</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:47.630" style="s2">of time that if you introduce the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:49.820" style="s2">policy crime rates will go up now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.630" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">going on where the same policy leads to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.820" end="00:04:55.370" style="s2">opposite outcomes it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:57.880" style="s2">these interacting localized behaviors in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.370" end="00:05:00.470" style="s2">this case the way that the policy</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.880" end="00:05:04.340" style="s2">influences the behavior of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.470" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">market in the economic system that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">certain contexts it will reduce crime in</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">other contexts it will incentivize and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:15.110" style="s2">directly other forms of activity that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:16.550" style="s2">lead to increases in crime and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.110" end="00:05:19.220" style="s2">thing that we can take away from this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.550" end="00:05:21.130" style="s2">that anyone who claims that in economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.220" end="00:05:23.560" style="s2">policy is going to only have one</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.130" end="00:05:25.430" style="s2">behavioural outcome for economies if</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.560" end="00:05:27.410" style="s2">someone you might want to be at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.430" end="00:05:29.870" style="s2">skeptical of and look more closely at</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.410" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">the way that the patterns of human</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.870" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">interaction lead to the macro scale</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">statistical behavior of that system and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:40.940" style="s2">that this complexity approach that looks</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:43.130" style="s2">at the interacting parts to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.940" end="00:05:44.780" style="s2">macro behavior emerges will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.130" end="00:05:47.390" style="s2">whether a policy is appropriate to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.780" end="00:05:48.950" style="s2">given context or not now clearly this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.390" end="00:05:51.770" style="s2">a very different way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.950" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">economic policy and economic planning a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.770" end="00:05:56.390" style="s2">very different way of thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:59.419" style="s2">to interpret statistics where</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:06:02.330" style="s2">specifically you do not treat statistics</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.419" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">as standalone measurements but instead</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.330" end="00:06:07.220" style="s2">you contextualise them to the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.030" end="00:06:09.169" style="s2">patterns of behavior in the system when</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.220" end="00:06:10.490" style="s2">you&#39;re making the measurement and if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.169" end="00:06:12.950" style="s2">have an understanding of what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.490" end="00:06:14.330" style="s2">behaviors are at the smaller scale that</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.330" end="00:06:18.830" style="s2">then you&#39;ll have some predictive ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:20.210" style="s2">about what that metric means but if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.830" end="00:06:23.419" style="s2">don&#39;t have an understanding of how the</p>
