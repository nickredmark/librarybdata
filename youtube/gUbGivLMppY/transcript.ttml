<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">internet&#39;s a little spotty apparently in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">london and i&#39;m in a new place</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">so we may get disturbed on many</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">different levels with the video so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">i&#39;ll just pause it and so but the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">recording may be a little choppy</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">but we&#39;ll make do with what we got um</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">well i</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">i think what i was saying is that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">actually think that whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">you&#39;re this was i don&#39;t think this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">your intention but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">you making these offerings on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">internet and teaching online yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">right is as i was saying that on one</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">people who are taking it are taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">something that probably is by definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">the least um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">immediately useful or instrumental right</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">philosophy by definition is is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">realm and which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it addresses what has things show</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">such that they&#39;re useful in the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">place right</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">yeah yeah so so that you&#39;re getting such</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">a good response</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:58.879" style="s2">and such good feedback on this i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">is showing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.879" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re one of the rare places where</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">people can start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">like in and it&#39;s the closing window i</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">think in my view</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">of where people can come and actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">learn and discuss and have their minds</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">sake in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">and i i have a sense of feeling is it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">is quite innovative</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">had bought all the books but as you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">a bit overwhelming sometimes and</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">becoming a private student</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">and we go through his writings together</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">he writes essays</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">and i give him comments on those essays</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s probably going to develop into</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">a longer piece</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">this time actually than on nietzsche um</p>

<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s pure that this it&#39;s purely for</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">once you yeah so uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">once you kind of divide it from from</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">from the instrumental it&#39;s it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">something where it perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">should have been anyways it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a free endeavor and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">peripatetic in that sense right it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">taking a a walk together in in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">rather than um wanting you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">the strangest things you have to do in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">university is you have to give learning</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">outcomes at the beginning of a seminar</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how that&#39;s what that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">know there&#39;s no learning outcome</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:21.839" style="s2">there&#39;s not a factory yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">someone someone asked recently what</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">about ammo fati and nietzsche and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">can we apply this</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">someone asked us in the live stream he</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">said no no there&#39;s no application</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">it happens in thinking it through and as</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">you think it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">you become it but you become this way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">yeah yeah totally and it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.920" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">i mean this is actually uh you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">contributed a chapter i just got done</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">finishing my chapter finally um on our</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">anthology with</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">with with verveiki and chris and about</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">about dialogos but one of the things i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">did was</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">um i really and i had no idea i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">such a degree about nihilism right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">once i started about it it just became</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">i really saw in a deep way how it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">underlying</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">everything in a way in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">nihilism itself couldn&#39;t account for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">and and i that&#39;s what strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">unique about what you&#39;re doing is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s showing one that there&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">is far i mean as far as that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">as far as we know right human beings</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">through thought right are the one are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">the one way in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">um you can access the world as such and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">and to into into to philosophize and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">think that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">is in some sense saying it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s saying which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s really disappearing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">sense of that there&#39;s a being and an</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">intelligence and being</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a way to listen the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">thinking is a kind of listening</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">and perceiving that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">that acknowledges that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">hidden and that thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">that philosophy is a way of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">that&#39;s hidden out in the open in that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">that that being has intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">um of and beyond its our own consumption</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">um is is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">that loss of that sense is nihilism um</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">and so i think philosophy is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">few ways that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">that people can actually come into that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">understanding of being through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">through the act of philosophizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why i think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">striking that people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">that what you&#39;re actually offering is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s outside of it&#39;s outside of or</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">different or other than nihilism in ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">that people probably can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">know to articulate i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">that maybe you could turn off your</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">microphone and get an echo</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">one of the things i so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">that&#39;s strange</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">it&#39;s having to at all having to explain</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">what it is that philosophy achieves</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">philosophy is not some strange</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">uh philosophy is not uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.160" style="s2">philosophy is an articulation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">actuality of the cliche or if you like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">reality which is not the term</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">most often used and not just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it articulates the way we</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">access the world right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">it um without philosophy there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">we don&#39;t have access to the world to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">what it means</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">to be on as well and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">nihilism is when you look at someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">like nietzsche uh nihilism for nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">some is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">one of the one of the results of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">death of god</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">but also of um</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">of of a you know a christian morality</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">that wanted to deny life</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the first consequence of morals</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">and the last consequence</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">morality wants to deny everything and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">denying</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">life and that means to deny</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">suffering etc if that is furniture</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s lionel has been at least to an</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">utter destruction</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">and the the nihilism that he sees is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">it will be um it will be the history for</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">the next 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">but now on on on what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">you just said</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">a bit more um</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">philosophy is not i will say it again</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">easier to say what philosophy is not um</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">is not something that arbitrarily we we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">can choose to do or not to do and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">highly assess this quite often he says</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">whether we have heard of certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">thoughts or not does not matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">and as nietzsche says in sarathustra</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">thoughts that come</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">on dove&#39;s feet guide the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">these are almost silent thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">they guide the world i mean no no no i</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">would probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">here&#39;s an outrageous claim most people</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">will never have heard of descartes</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">um certainly you know people who listen</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">to to you and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">channel they will have heard of rene</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">descartes</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">um and of the cartesian subjective</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">subjectivity etc but most haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">and still it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">the self</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">understanding of most people in the west</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">beyond and if your self</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">understanding is even if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">articulated it like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">that i am the positive ego</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">off in my world</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m looking for certainty</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">and that i can posit that certainty over</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">over the world or objects of and over</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">then i&#39;m like you know simplifying</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">things and i&#39;m a cathedral subject</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">even without ever having heard of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">name because i&#39;m simply as highly i</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:52.839" style="s2">would put it</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">thrown into this um into this</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">history that i have to accept as my own</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">and what we can learn from a thinker</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">like nietzsche is that we are you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">really at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">at he says the destiny is growing</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">right and someone like nietzsche who is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">who does not have the releasement of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">heidegger who was</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">glass and about letting go especially an</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">old age</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">he would probably run around screaming</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">and he could see what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">because he said no we have to transvalue</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">all values we cannot come back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">uh um a christian</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">morality without christianity</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">right so the the entire neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">nonsense about</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">let&#39;s reduce suffering etc that to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">nietzsche that&#39;s just christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">disguise</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">and he&#39;s also the the death of god of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">which he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">nietzsche isn&#39;t nietzsche wants to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">an f</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">a way of affirming life and here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">what what does life mean for nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">life he says</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">is everything that we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">including our shadows and everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">that hits us</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">that meets us that affects us if we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">able to transfigure</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">all of this into light and flame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">a direct quote</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">then that&#39;s life so what is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">be affirmed</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">with nietzsche is this profound sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">um and then move and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">hopefully be able to move through</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">nihilism in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">manner and artistically so as well so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">perhaps you know to bring this back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">the uh beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">dialogue um there is a certain artistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">element to what i do</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">i would say um which as you know i&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">that there is something overarching</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">about technology</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know did he actually kill</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">someone i mean he sent</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">you know he he became quite violent</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">um and and all he thought of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">was technology right what were</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">technological tools</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">so he was completely unfree in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">relationship with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">nietzsche says somewhere in in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">and i realized over the years that you</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">it can be it can get you down</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">it&#39;s a death by numbers you&#39;re evaluated</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">um and especially also when you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">you know so i but then i realized by</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">through by just really enough uploading</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">a few videos on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">and not caring about numbers like how</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">many hits how many likes</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">how many doesn&#39;t matter none of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">matters what matters is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">genuine project</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">that needs to be articulated and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">and that usually leads to something if</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">completely nothing right and so it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">is quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very playful this whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">this is what i&#39;m learning again with</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">reading nietzsche now is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">the the the playful attitude towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">which is for him that the apollonian in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">the mix with the dionysian right so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">playing with with these tools you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">doing this as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">obviously um and and but only to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">to incr almost you know we can almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">say increase our freedom or liberate</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">ourselves more and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">be not letting us get down or</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">be ruled by it so i find that very</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">exhilarating i find it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">really fascinating what that this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">what because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">you could just look at these things the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">entire time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">and be kind of be dominated</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">by the machine yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">but no i mean no one when they started</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">youtube i mean no one no one thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">that this would happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">i mean it was it was for cats let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">people were uploading cat videos that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">yeah totally it&#39;s totally rogue right</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">they were the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">they&#39;re the beginning internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">and they would just go at each other it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">was a prayer apparently it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">ruthless the guy um cory anton is one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">uh one of the first people who got on</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">there and started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">philosophy and he talks a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve had him on the channel a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">times but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go back to something that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">said that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">about this connection between there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">something about philosophy and art</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">right and especially making art that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">a set there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">they come from a similar root of some</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">and i have to say i was struck by in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">so this was my first venture into</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">writing kind of an academic</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">like paper um i went to art school and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">all that stuff i never really just</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">i i just never was that never was asked</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">of me</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">so i i wasn&#39;t sure exactly how this was</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">going to go but i was quite struck</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">and it felt it almost exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">painting and sculpting it almost felt</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">exactly like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">and and why a particular part of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">if you you know if you ask people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t painters and sculptors and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">to think about like a a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">a studio of people painting let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">usually they have they have a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">to think they picture</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">people with paint brushes painting on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">canvas</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">but actually if you go into an actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">painting studio</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">you know in this and i went to the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">of the best art schools in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">like the most avant-garde</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">you know ones in the world and what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">saw was not people painting but you</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">you saw people standing back and looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">at their painting from different angles</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">and going like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">and listening to some kind of obscure</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">classical music</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">right and then every hour or so they may</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">come up and just do one little brush</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">stroke and they sit back</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">right and it was very it&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">painting as in as in right</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">creating in that sense it is much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">of a sense and i really get this and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">think people who do art will will</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">you know if they look they they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">probably agree is like it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in you&#39;re in a relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:02.080" style="s2">the authority is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">is the painting and the stroke</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.080" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">that you always have an idea for like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">some idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">what you want the what the stroke that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.440" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">you the next stroke</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">to do what you think it wants to do but</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">then it pushes back</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s an intelligibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">painting that&#39;s never exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">actually put down</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">and you have to contend with that and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">found that to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">the same sense about writing this paper</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">i get clear about something i write a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">sentence down to articulate it and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">in writing and i realized something</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">wasn&#39;t totally complete or that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">highlighted something i didn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">to you but</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">absolutely that said something that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s making you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">making available the world because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">nihilism making everything available is</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">the beauty of the world and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">that a poet does</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">let&#39;s come back to maybe what heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">says what is it that a poet does for</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">heidegger or</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">a painter a painter for heiliger does</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">not represent anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">a good painter a good painter brings</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">forth a world</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">let&#39;s shine something that&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">but often covered over right just that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">just that sense of bringing forth right</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">i i hear in that i hear in that that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">on one level</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a completely different way</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">of perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">right because i think most of our worlds</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">are produced</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">right yeah but this sense of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">forth the world just that just that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">place of coming from was something right</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">it seems to presuppose i hear in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">that there&#39;s that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">hidden there&#39;s something concealed</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">and that which is most concealed</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">probably demarcates not it&#39;s whether or</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">not it exists or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">right but but a kind of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">that with that with gumption</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">with devotion with a certain from a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">certain attitude you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">bring forth right into unconcealed and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.399" style="s2">conceal a world</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">that on some level i think it was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.399" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">heidegger would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">the difference between something being</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">produced and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">the sense of being something being</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">accomplished right that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">the produce is really tied to produce</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">the air which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">tied to cause and effect whereas to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">accomplish something</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">i think this is in the letter on</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">humanism where he says that to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">accomplish is to bring something</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">um into the fullness of its essence and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">forth into its appearing life and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">can only</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">accomplish that which is already there</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">and that which is already always there</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">is being right so just in that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">artistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">bringing forth the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">is an understanding that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">because i mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">it&#39;s rapidly disappearing like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:46.480" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">disappearing from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">the the intelligibility that people wake</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">up into</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">right um and the frame that people live</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">inside of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s striking to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">about vandalism is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">is it it makes no account for itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t occur for</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">that they&#39;re nihilistic and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">is doesn&#39;t this get into</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">the difference because there is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">difference between what nietzsche calls</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">nihilism and what heidegger calls</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">nihilism isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">yeah yeah can you speak to that a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">bit i think that may be</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">interesting um i mean it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">um on so i mean if you come</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">from heidegger how he interprets</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">nietzsche and nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">in a nutshell it&#39;s is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing with beings so</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">beings themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">lose their meaning and they become</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">nothing and that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">you know uh consequential to some</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">trajectory of metaphysics not all of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that all of metaphysics is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">purely nihilistic or anything but there</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">is a forgot</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">an oblivion of negativity and of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">the nothing of nihil um as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">and with with heidi what what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">in actually in his nietzsche book in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">second volume</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">he says that there is an authentic</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">nihilist man</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">and and that that&#39;s the following</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s one way so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">arriving at being means at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">being able to let go of it for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">one wishes to grasp is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">withdrawing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the thought of being itself and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">in in neighborhood of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">the nothing yeah but for nietzsche it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s concerning it&#39;s concerned</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">really with</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">with the world with beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">um so as he says for example in</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">um in the fifth book let me find it</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">off of the gay science in section</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.400" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">346</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">i think uh he says at the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a you know he says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">a terrifying either or</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">which is now upon europeans which is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">following and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">translating from the chairman either you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">um abolish</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">your own ways of honoring god etc or</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">you abolish yourselves and he says the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">letter would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">nihilism um but he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">other ways so the abolishment of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">of the world that would be nihilism but</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">he&#39;s got other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">speaking about my life so he speaks of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">of an active nihilism he speaks of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">incomplete nihilism he speaks of passive</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">so a passive nihilism is as he says</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a sign of weakness</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">um the force of spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">um is is tired</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">and no longer does it find</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">any or it finds is it finds</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">it its aims or goals and values</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">that it had up until now spirit utterly</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">and does not believe in them anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s a passive nihilism an active</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">as he says can be a sign of strength</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what nietzsche says</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">in the saratha</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:44.079" style="s2">my i think that&#39;s one of my</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">and here&#39;s something that happens here</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">samathustra</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:16.839" style="s2">comes back to the city this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">middle of the books in the third book</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">someone who sounds like him at in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">beginning you think it&#39;s this could</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">almost be sabathus this is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">and then but then you realize no no</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">this the tone here is different you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">begin to realize the tone is cynical</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s like diogenes oh look at me</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m looking for a human being</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">because apparently you&#39;re the only one</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">who is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">but you know the funny thing about</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">diogenes is when i said this to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">a private student this week is um the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">entrepreneurs is so focused on the</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">and on everyone on the market square</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">that he&#39;s completely dependent upon it</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">right and so he becomes cynical because</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">no one else is</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">you know no one else is as good as</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">diocese no one is good enough for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">uh and this is what this copycat of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">sarathustra begins to sound like</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">very very cynical and savatustra says at</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">you know he says i i and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">nietzsche never has any compassion but</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">there he&#39;s you know he lets</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">this say you know i feel pity for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">and um and then he says where you can no</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">longer love</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">there you shall move over and on</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">you shall move on you must go over and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">and that that&#39;s to me that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">a a way of you know aspiring to this</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">this completely different understanding</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">of what the over men the evil mensch is</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">and and this different tone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:52.800" style="s2">you know nietzsche or sarathustra never</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">condemns the city</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like it he doesn&#39;t enjoy life</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">in the city</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">in the market square but he doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">you know let&#39;s burn it to the ground uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">you&#39;re all idiots</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">um but he you know he has his his</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">moments where he he can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">you know very cynical and and full of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">resentment too but not in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">sabathustra</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s really in because</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">what are we what&#39;s one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">problems of nihilism now</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">is of this if this period is nihilism is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">resentment right revenge</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">wanting to tear down instead of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">to build yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">we need a will to build a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">meaningful and that that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">sense and brings something</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">forth rather than</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">you know all these different terms like</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">personal the way i grew up with almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">this kind of it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">terrible when you&#39;re old because you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">have a shop and it&#39;s just a nightmare to</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">and then you move on and then and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">just gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s weird that we have to why</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">right if if no i mean let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">use these forces uh for force</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">for liberation and not to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">an extended you know decades-long</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">existence no but to bring some spark</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">into the world this sense the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">what you said</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">resentment is what characterizes the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">time of nihilism is resentment</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">interesting going on in the united</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">states right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">right with these this rioting</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">that&#39;s happening like in the northwest</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">and stuff is it&#39;s unclear</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">who exactly they&#39;re writing against</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">right there&#39;s these big things but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">uh it&#39;s there&#39;s an argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">about what they are panning together and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">protesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">against like that&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">just that it&#39;s a question right</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">you start to think well what is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">resentment that they&#39;re in acting out</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">i think it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">resentment for being resentful</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">right the object of the resentment is</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">almost second</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:24.000" style="s2">second nature but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">deep uh that&#39;s funny i haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.000" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">thought about it in these terms but</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">look there&#39;s there&#39;s something profound</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">happening which is um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">which i mean we are pushing</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">towards a future that is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">just a black</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">wall and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">it is it you know it is strange to to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">of the occident to be western</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">and looking back on thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">off of an extended history right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">homer the greeks the romans and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">whatever else as americans</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">would say all this stuff um but so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">extended</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">uh history nietzsche says this is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">a massive problem uh to</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s this humongous relief and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:59.920" style="s2">people walk away</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.839" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">and then they they came away</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">and like life was completely different</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">after that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">and i think one of the one of the things</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">hearing me talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s perspective on nihilism and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">the way that he talks about that it</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:32.799" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">it almost sounds like something about</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.799" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">that festival</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t i doubt it was conscious but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">that festival that seems like almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">like an epitome</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">of playfulness right of</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">seeing through the aristocratic</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">and like all of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">and making fun of it right in these</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">really meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2">felt sense ways that i don&#39;t i i</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">that i i can&#39;t imagine that there being</p>

<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">tragic it would just be uh orgastic</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">or too too much of an of uh</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">but not in a socratic sense so socratic</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">sense would mean to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">total transparency over yourself and</p>

<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">and so that measuredness</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">and also you know what what you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">supposed to ask</p>

<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">the apollonian now and then some</p>

<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">that means um next to each other</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.960" end="01:05:15.039" style="s2">parallel</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">and the that that&#39;s for him that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.240" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">to be able to be at this level and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:25.920" style="s2">know to some degree you could say you</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">know it requires some organization with</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:29.359" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:30.720" style="s2">particular festival uh so maybe it comes</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.720" end="01:05:35.039" style="s2">speak to it</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">um but uh yeah and it there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.039" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">the the you know what we said so</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:44.079" style="s2">benignly called leisure</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">uh scole in greek</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.079" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">in ancient greece that that was very</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.160" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">often uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">orgastic i mean these you know also the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:59.119" style="s2">the philosophical dialogues uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">uh the symposium means to drink together</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.119" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">and to let the the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">wine which is dionysian um</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">take over to some degree but not only</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:14.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s this and this of course you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.319" end="01:06:17.559" style="s2">to some degree it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:20.160" style="s2">because we live in a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.559" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">compartmentalized uh existence right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.160" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s your weekday it&#39;s your weekend</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where you do this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">where you do this</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">uh so it&#39;s it&#39;s a fuller</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:37.520" style="s2">way of being um</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">would not be burning man 365 days</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.520" end="01:06:43.920" style="s2">um but um but</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">but would would be where all of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">comes together</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">and it comes together naturally almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">i can&#39;t really um i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:55.520" style="s2">you know what would a niche chain will</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:06:56.640" style="s2">look like that&#39;s what i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.520" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">now i have to think about this a bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.640" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">more maybe i&#39;ll say something maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">but yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">totally well it just also seems that</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.960" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">you know there&#39;s that quality of of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">you know if you speak to like well why</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.680" end="01:07:14.720" style="s2">would you engage in philosophy why would</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:18.319" style="s2">you read philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.720" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">right the act of genuinely</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">considering is opening up to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">hidden right that</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">in the sense that there&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">value in what&#39;s hidden</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:32.559" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">i would say that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.559" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">that i i would imagine something of uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:40.880" style="s2">some when i imagine the nietzschean</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">world what would a nietzsche that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.880" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">interesting question what would it</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">look like i i just get the sense that it</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">has a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:52.319" style="s2">relationship to bus to possibility right</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">that there be that there be a kind of i</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.319" end="01:07:54.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know of an exaltation but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.440" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.839" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">something something grabs your interest</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.440" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">a possibility speaks to you that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">have a that there be some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">um almost</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">in all all the levels of love</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:12.640" style="s2">relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">following that and letting it letting it</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.640" end="01:08:18.480" style="s2">articulate you as particularly dead</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">um and the exuberance from</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.480" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">from possibility i would imagine a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:27.520" style="s2">it would have a lot to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.480" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">like the future speaking to you right</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.520" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">and letting letting yourself be and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">would have to say that that actually has</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:36.839" style="s2">been i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">in reading heidegger in this these</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.839" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">if if there are training for anything it</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">seems like that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:47.920" style="s2">training for right is</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">to to just continually</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.920" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">be open to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">you&#39;re there&#39;s of a horizons of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:56.159" style="s2">intelligibility that are concealed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:59.759" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.159" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">and that and that you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">they can address you right if you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">start to hear them</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">and um and i think that that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:12.239" style="s2">what came through and developed like</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">developing and circling was very much</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.239" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">it like the influence of heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so much about like making a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">practice that was a heidi gary practice</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">explicitly it was more like</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">it was more like grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">heidegger allowed me to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">un start to see phenomenologically um</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">and that seeing phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.960" end="01:09:33.759" style="s2">happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">what a big part of how circling</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.759" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">right um and speaking and being able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">listen to people who are always</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:44.080" style="s2">like kind of getting the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:46.400" style="s2">people whenever anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:47.679" style="s2">alive they&#39;re in response to an</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">understanding of being</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">right and so listening to somebody isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s so much listening to them</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s as it is listening what</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">right um and and having a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.719" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">that&#39;s about what&#39;s unconcealing what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">right and they have then they they put</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.960" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">it in terms of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.159" style="s2">oh yeah i feel really seen by you or i</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:14.159" style="s2">feel really understood by you or</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.159" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">something like that but it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.159" end="01:10:16.719" style="s2">under it&#39;s not exactly understanding</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:19.360" style="s2">them like an</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.719" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">object that they by which they</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s more like no listening to them is</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.480" end="01:10:25.199" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">as they&#39;re speaking they&#39;re speaking to</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.199" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">something and then you</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">really listen as to is to hear</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">what they&#39;re responding to and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">and have it come forth to both of you</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">and that usually</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">some version of what we end up talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">about is some possibility that&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">closed and which is affecting them or</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">some possibility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s opening up that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">challenging them in some level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.280" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">usually what the conversation ends up</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:54.159" style="s2">being about</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.360" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">right so i would imagine that like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.159" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">nietzschean world would have something</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:11:00.880" style="s2">to do with</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">an exalted or attuned relationship to</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">and flow states</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">it&#39;s well he says</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">when you think of the closing his eyes</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">listening into the hidden</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:37.920" style="s2">what is it that that&#39;s that&#39;s occurring</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.120" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.920" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">what&#39;s occurring is the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.440" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">frightening earthquake and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.080" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">death of god</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">this isn&#39;t some you know benign event</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">this is something that we as he says we</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">only have to begin</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:12:02.640" style="s2">to even be able to wake up to</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:02.640" style="s2">that this has occurred and</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">this so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of horror right and he</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">needs to speak of the horror of aqui the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">horror of emptiness rather than not</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:17.920" style="s2">wanting at all</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">the human being wants nothing</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.920" end="01:12:23.760" style="s2">and anitchin</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">and then the will to power if you take</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.760" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">it seriously is</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">is not just about some you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">someone take taking power or</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:37.920" style="s2">political power no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">it means that there&#39;s a a field</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.920" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">of force field of insane</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">power that we can call if you want</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">that&#39;s one other name for what we call</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:53.360" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.199" end="01:12:56.239" style="s2">and that we are now tapping into</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.360" end="01:12:56.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we run these machines</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.640" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">by extracting vast amounts of power and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">from previously hidden sources</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:12.800" style="s2">and and by unchanneling them</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:15.360" style="s2">and at the same time what begins to</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.800" end="01:13:15.360" style="s2">occur is</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.920" end="01:13:22.960" style="s2">seems to be also some sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:27.280" style="s2">weird sameness and turning around</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.960" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">and around itself a repetition</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.280" end="01:13:31.120" style="s2">so we are responding to the will to</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">power and the eternal recurrence of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.120" end="01:13:36.239" style="s2">same in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:39.760" style="s2">purely technical instrumental</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.239" end="01:13:40.960" style="s2">but not artistic if we were to respond</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.760" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">to it artistic</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:44.719" style="s2">then they can be liberating then we are</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">not you know why do people speak of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.719" end="01:13:48.320" style="s2">the hamster wheel or the rat race that</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:51.120" style="s2">that kind of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">and nietzsche by the way haha in the</p>

<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">is the total economic management of the</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">so what else</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">he also says</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:28.480" style="s2">that what&#39;s upon us is the installment</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.080" end="01:14:32.719" style="s2">of an unhomely uncanny wheel work</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.480" end="01:14:35.600" style="s2">with ever more finely adapted wheels</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.719" end="01:14:37.360" style="s2">where the human being is reduced to that</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:40.560" style="s2">wheel and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.360" end="01:14:42.560" style="s2">the instrumental uh rationalistic</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">response to the will to power which</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.560" end="01:14:44.800" style="s2">heidegger then will call the will to</p>

<p begin="01:14:44.800" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">right which is another name for</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:51.120" style="s2">positive feedback loops that can</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.120" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">and then of course and then the question</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.640" end="01:15:01.840" style="s2">becomes well what&#39;s the exit</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">right this is something many people ask</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.840" end="01:15:06.719" style="s2">what&#39;s the accent how do you get out</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:07.520" style="s2">uh because there is this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.719" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">repetition</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.520" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">of sameness and that lies</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.120" end="01:15:19.360" style="s2">somewhere in um</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.040" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">in yeah i mean you could say possibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.360" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">it lies somewhere in in</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.239" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">going over and beyond which you could</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:30.000" style="s2">think of as possibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">and then becoming open to this entirely</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.000" end="01:15:35.679" style="s2">other dimension</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">which also you know which is possible</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.679" end="01:15:42.480" style="s2">uh in which we can begin to</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:43.520" style="s2">as you know he sometimes uses this this</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:46.239" style="s2">image of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.520" end="01:15:47.280" style="s2">of the ship of sailing towards new</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.280" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">um and then the eternal recurrence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.600" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">is no longer crushing</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">but becomes something liberating because</p>

<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">every moment and that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s so brutal about it but that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">it can become liberating because for</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.840" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">nietzsche there&#39;s no way out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">necessity everything is always</p>

<p begin="01:16:23.120" end="01:16:29.760" style="s2">and so and then in every moment</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.400" end="01:16:33.199" style="s2">that requires a genuine decision</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.760" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">in your life that recurs in the next</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.679" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">on our highest as nietzsche we put it</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.960" end="01:17:14.239" style="s2">forever i mean this is your finitude in</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.040" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">eternity</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.239" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">um and it will recur in your finite</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:21.600" style="s2">existence forevermore</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:22.719" style="s2">and so in the moment that you just</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.600" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">described off</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.719" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">of you know being you know i&#39;m i feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.960" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">seen i feel listened to etc</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.280" style="s2">that can become a moment of making the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:33.520" style="s2">next moment the highest</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.280" end="01:17:35.600" style="s2">and that will recur so that the next</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.520" end="01:17:38.880" style="s2">highest next moment</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.600" end="01:17:42.560" style="s2">is again a highest and then it&#39;s a light</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.880" end="01:17:44.960" style="s2">play right so it&#39;s elevating itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.560" end="01:17:46.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s recurring within itself and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.960" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s when it becomes meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re you live</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:50.719" style="s2">forever it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">it means</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.719" end="01:17:55.280" style="s2">um but we are trapped in this reputation</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.280" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">right i mean um</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:04.239" style="s2">you know even though there is now is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">pandemic etc people work from home the</p>

<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:12.000" style="s2">um and why is it that it&#39;s described as</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.400" end="01:18:14.400" style="s2">a wheel well it is an uncanny</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.000" end="01:18:16.239" style="s2">wheel work where we are finally adapted</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.239" end="01:18:20.320" style="s2">and uh we are reduced and reduced to</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:24.080" style="s2">cannon fodder</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.320" end="01:18:28.320" style="s2">or as marx puts a reserve army</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.080" end="01:18:31.679" style="s2">uh standing ready to be exploited</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.320" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">um but there is for nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.679" end="01:18:34.159" style="s2">there is deposit not for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:34.719" style="s2">obviously but phoenicians not for</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.719" end="01:18:39.120" style="s2">nietzsche is not an egalitarian that</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.199" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">should be very clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.120" end="01:18:42.400" style="s2">for nietzsche it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a few uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">who can</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.400" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">and they will be able to um</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:52.080" style="s2">to live up to this highest</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:53.280" style="s2">uh in their own being but it&#39;s still in</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.080" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">a finite existence</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">and it is about what you know you</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">how you find the stance in to speak with</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:06.080" style="s2">hiding in the midst of beings</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:07.920" style="s2">um and it&#39;s there are consequences to</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">thinking there are consequences to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.920" end="01:19:12.239" style="s2">actions</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">there are consequences to decisions</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.239" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">because they&#39;re not just mere choices</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:18.080" style="s2">you know like a consumption choice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:20.320" style="s2">a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.080" end="01:19:21.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a judgment and that</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.679" end="01:19:26.640" style="s2">leads to another judgment and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.840" end="01:19:28.560" style="s2">becomes your exit that becomes your life</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.640" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">yeah and then of course the question is</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.560" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">can you affirm it here&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:35.360" style="s2">quote from nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:39.120" style="s2">if you become young when you&#39;re old</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.360" end="01:19:42.640" style="s2">you will stay young for a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.120" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">because some people the thinking kinds</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.640" end="01:20:10.800" style="s2">it must be extended and prolonged etc</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.159" end="01:20:12.239" style="s2">because that which is there is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">coming out</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.239" end="01:20:15.679" style="s2">yeah and you can see it but you can see</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">when it&#39;s not coming out with people</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.679" end="01:20:19.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s perhaps also describing oh i</p>

<p begin="01:20:19.199" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">because there is the moment something</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.199" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out all of a sudden yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.840" end="01:20:37.199" style="s2">what&#39;s that you said you are a finitude</p>

<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">right uh but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.639" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s just uh that&#39;s a bit</p>

<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:56.560" style="s2">think about it in your finite existence</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:57.520" style="s2">within that finitude everything recurs</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.560" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.520" end="01:21:02.880" style="s2">yeah yeah so you you better respond</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">in a way that you can allow this to</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.880" end="01:21:08.639" style="s2">recur forever because what how</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.960" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">so much of what you know uh neurosis</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.639" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">uh and and you know which are</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.040" end="01:21:16.480" style="s2">or that i&#39;m not speaking about you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.880" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">severe uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.480" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">cases of psychiatric</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">uh uh malaise that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:26.800" style="s2">that can befall people and maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:29.040" style="s2">neurosis what is it it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.800" end="01:21:33.199" style="s2">that&#39;s being suppressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.040" end="01:21:35.520" style="s2">um and it&#39;s being suppressed con repeat</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.199" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">repetitively you know psychologists</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.520" end="01:21:38.320" style="s2">speak of patterns</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:40.639" style="s2">right they speak of let&#39;s break a</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.320" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">pattern here let&#39;s what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">pattern let&#39;s break it etc well you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">a pattern that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s too well what is it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:50.719" style="s2">something being repeated the entire time</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:53.040" style="s2">and that can be just one decision made</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.719" end="01:21:54.080" style="s2">once that then repeats itself in every</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.040" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">single moment</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.080" end="01:21:58.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s in psychologically it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:22:00.639" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.080" end="01:22:02.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a visualization etc that can lead</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.639" end="01:22:05.360" style="s2">to the ever same</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.239" end="01:22:08.239" style="s2">results if you like all the time but</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.360" end="01:22:09.440" style="s2">with nietzsche or with you know with a</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.239" end="01:22:12.159" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.440" end="01:22:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s richer because it comes from</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.159" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.360" end="01:22:17.600" style="s2">as a case who&#39;s doing something wrong it</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:20.080" style="s2">has to do with time</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.600" end="01:22:20.639" style="s2">and how we understand time and what kind</p>

<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly eternal recurrence of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.639" end="01:22:32.639" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.760" end="01:22:33.600" style="s2">properly understood because that which</p>

<p begin="01:23:32.880" end="01:23:40.560" style="s2">trying to write poetry like hillary did</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.840" end="01:23:43.760" style="s2">um and nietzsche did yeah that lets you</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.560" end="01:23:47.040" style="s2">too far into the future did i fly dread</p>

<p begin="01:23:47.040" end="01:23:50.880" style="s2">some of the spookiest things here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.719" end="01:23:53.920" style="s2">something spooky from heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.880" end="01:23:57.920" style="s2">he says in his lecture course on plato</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.920" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">on alithea it&#39;s up to us as much as to</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.920" end="01:24:01.600" style="s2">plato</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:03.679" style="s2">to make sure that alethia is not</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.600" end="01:24:05.600" style="s2">something of the past but becomes our</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.679" end="01:24:08.719" style="s2">genuine history</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.600" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">take the first half it&#39;s up to us as</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.719" end="01:24:13.280" style="s2">much as to plato</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.320" end="01:24:14.400" style="s2">i mean this is this is this is extremely</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.280" end="01:24:16.239" style="s2">weird right because</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.400" end="01:24:17.840" style="s2">when you listen to this carefully what</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.239" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">he&#39;s actually saying is</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.840" end="01:24:23.360" style="s2">we are we can be in the same sphere as</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.600" end="01:24:25.520" style="s2">this man still because this way of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.360" end="01:24:26.560" style="s2">thinking and this comes back to what we</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.520" end="01:24:29.040" style="s2">said before</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.560" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">think thoughts that guide thoughts that</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.040" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">come on dove&#39;s feet</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">guide the world so we we can be in these</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">spheres</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.880" end="01:24:42.080" style="s2">where plato is still speaking because</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.280" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">these thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.080" end="01:24:45.440" style="s2">still move everything i mean if you read</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">the cave and you don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">what we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:53.760" style="s2">um then then nothing can help you uh but</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.760" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">sorry first you know but then uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:03.679" style="s2">but here so what would the nietzschean</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:07.280" style="s2">world look like it would look like</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.679" end="01:25:10.840" style="s2">you you are you know kind of led into</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.280" end="01:25:12.159" style="s2">uh not a dollar universe that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.840" end="01:25:15.600" style="s2">expanding</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.159" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">but but but a self-contained cosmos that</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.600" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:19.600" style="s2">and as heraclitus says also has no</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:22.840" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.600" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">and no ending and you are a finite</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.840" end="01:25:27.040" style="s2">instantiation</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:28.000" style="s2">of these movements of time where</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.040" end="01:25:31.440" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.000" end="01:25:34.960" style="s2">will always already have happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.440" end="01:25:38.239" style="s2">but you and you we can tap into this or</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.960" end="01:25:40.719" style="s2">find lean into it find it tear it open</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.239" end="01:25:41.600" style="s2">through and then through a different</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.719" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.600" end="01:25:47.040" style="s2">of language and then you you know you</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:48.400" style="s2">begin to remember yourself differently</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.040" end="01:25:50.320" style="s2">right maybe this is also something</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.400" end="01:25:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in circling is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.320" end="01:25:53.600" style="s2">what does it mean to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.000" end="01:25:55.040" style="s2">it&#39;s because all of a sudden you&#39;re seen</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.600" end="01:25:57.920" style="s2">in a different way</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.040" end="01:25:58.719" style="s2">and that but to be seen means to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.920" end="01:26:00.560" style="s2">any sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.719" end="01:26:02.000" style="s2">like a sense of who you are how do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.560" end="01:26:03.679" style="s2">have a sense of who you are is by</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.000" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">remembering who you are</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.679" end="01:26:08.880" style="s2">but to be seen means to begin to</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:13.040" style="s2">remember yourself differently yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.880" end="01:26:15.440" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.040" end="01:26:16.320" style="s2">i just had to thought about it in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.440" end="01:26:20.239" style="s2">world as one</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.320" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">which the world becomes</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.239" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">you can re you the world in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.560" end="01:26:26.719" style="s2">right that&#39;s similar to that</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.560" end="01:26:27.840" style="s2">right of of the text being this alien</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.719" end="01:26:30.159" style="s2">text right</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.840" end="01:26:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s non-proposition alien text it just</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.159" end="01:26:34.000" style="s2">struck me of like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.679" end="01:26:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s about to be in a nature world is to</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.000" end="01:26:39.440" style="s2">read the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.040" end="01:26:39.440" style="s2">as that kind of a text right</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.800" end="01:26:45.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s to it</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.840" end="01:26:50.080" style="s2">and not just arbitrarily right i mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.560" end="01:26:52.800" style="s2">this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.080" end="01:26:55.679" style="s2">um you know dolly&#39;s books about</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.800" end="01:26:57.679" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s writing his own life etc</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.679" end="01:26:59.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s psychologically interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.679" end="01:27:01.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s biographically important</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.920" end="01:27:03.840" style="s2">perhaps but</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.120" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">if you take thinking seriously the</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.840" end="01:27:08.239" style="s2">nietzsche does</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:09.760" style="s2">stand in a certain tradition and has to</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.239" end="01:27:13.440" style="s2">wrestle with it</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.760" end="01:27:15.120" style="s2">and and also sees something about what</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.440" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">is coming i mean he says at some point</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.120" end="01:27:20.080" style="s2">what is coming now</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:23.360" style="s2">is the historical sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.080" end="01:27:23.360" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.760" end="01:27:31.520" style="s2">and that that means</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.600" end="01:27:36.320" style="s2">max themes and reflections that history</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.400" end="01:27:43.920" style="s2">is the weight of mutual assessment</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:45.360" style="s2">we must be able to forget to actively</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.920" end="01:27:48.880" style="s2">forget</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.360" end="01:27:52.239" style="s2">um and because what</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.880" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t it strange we live in this</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.239" end="01:27:58.320" style="s2">almost frozen time where</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.600" end="01:27:59.360" style="s2">you can just gaze back upon the</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.320" end="01:28:01.679" style="s2">millennia and just</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.360" end="01:28:03.360" style="s2">pick and choose whatever you darn well</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:06.480" style="s2">wish you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.360" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">some ism here some some some peace from</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.480" end="01:28:10.239" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:12.000" style="s2">and why is this all becoming available</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.239" end="01:28:15.600" style="s2">but like like the entire</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.000" end="01:28:17.920" style="s2">planet is a museum yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.600" end="01:28:20.480" style="s2">yes it could be inventoried right and</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.920" end="01:28:20.480" style="s2">presented</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.679" end="01:28:24.880" style="s2">yeah we had the inventory before we</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.120" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">started this yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.880" end="01:28:28.000" style="s2">so you see you can you can you can use</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:31.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.000" end="01:28:34.880" style="s2">something like youtube to uh to start</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.199" end="01:28:37.199" style="s2">a ch an inventory channel shall we</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.880" end="01:28:38.639" style="s2">um here&#39;s the here&#39;s a philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.199" end="01:28:42.000" style="s2">inventory</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.639" end="01:28:44.639" style="s2">um or you can generate</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.000" end="01:28:45.360" style="s2">something um that&#39;s in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.639" end="01:28:48.400" style="s2">artistic</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.360" end="01:28:50.080" style="s2">dionysian but apollonian as well</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.400" end="01:28:51.600" style="s2">because it tries to find its own measure</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.080" end="01:28:54.159" style="s2">within itself</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.600" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">and lets something spontaneously occur</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.159" end="01:28:58.639" style="s2">right we</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:29:00.080" style="s2">have no idea we&#39;ll sit down okay let&#39;s</p>
