<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">for me um for wiki election and just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.719" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">conversation around fighting</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:49.600" style="s2">misinformation in general i mean i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">had this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.600" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">i think a thousand times over the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">uh couple of months</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:56.480" style="s2">where i think just globally we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">trust vacuum right now and that affects</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.480" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">that affects the ability you know for uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">like for people to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and for important things</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">whether it&#39;s vaccines in general whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s climate change</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">for all of that thing for all of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for people to know what to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">trust if they don&#39;t trust the government</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:18.400" style="s2">or the media and they don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">experts being</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">you know shown are actually worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">of trust especially if they conflict</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">with each other um</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">which obviously i think that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">clear what&#39;s in it for the average</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:33.520" style="s2">but like for what&#39;s in it from a game a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">space i think a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">is both like corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">governments</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">are now fighting a very uphill battle</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">when it comes to like if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">have something</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.680" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">worthy of sharing and you have something</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">that you think is true</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">how do you differentiate that from all</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">the other noise out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">and so i mean it&#39;s being able to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">your point across in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">is hopefully worthy of trust um</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.079" style="s2">unfortunately for them it means that if</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">it&#39;s not worthy of trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.079" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point it&#39;s not to let</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">anybody talk it&#39;s to let what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">trustworthy get to to the top so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">that that&#39;s kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">is if your story is worth telling then</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">ideally it should surface and it should</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">be given more weight amongst all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">other noise</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here i mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">all right does that matter yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">um yes so uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">for reason score there&#39;s several</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">different since it&#39;s kind of a tool that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">fits in other things or several</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">different use cases so</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">for like the goalie bot version it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">just kind of a resource</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">like um like</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">a politifact or snopes</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">except that it gets into deeper broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">subjects</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">and then with this you can also be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">that fact-finding process so you can add</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">facts to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">well you could suggest them in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">goalie bot</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">process and since all the suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">are on twitter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">anyone can see if i&#39;ve ignored your</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">suggestion or goalie bot has</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">so it&#39;d just be kind of a central</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">resource for facts and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">and then the reason score tool uh i hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">it will be useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">later on for people like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">trying to make a decision in an open</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">cooperative or a group</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">kind of like this if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">contentious issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">maybe it would help with that where you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">want to use evidence to make the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">usually on large decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">yeah and then for the goalie bot side</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">just go back to that if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">vote</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">on some</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">initiative in your town city or federal</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">it would be a resource to go to to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">uh a lay of all the facts and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">so that yeah i think that would cover</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">most of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">i can go next my coffee&#39;s kicked in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">although now there&#39;s a kid screaming the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">next room so that&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">there&#39;s what is my project um</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">that was a reason score that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">name solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">what&#39;s in it for people is i will get</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">rid of all of your screaming children</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">that is that is the next solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">raising um</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know whether to answer it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">right now or the future of solutionizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">and so i will answer it for right now to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">come to solution raising what&#39;s in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">for you you&#39;re probably not my people</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">yet so that is fine but for the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">person what&#39;s in it for them is to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">come have a conversation and generate</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">actual solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">that are feasibly possible and so to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">a hopeful conversation that these things</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">doable with out needing mass buy-in at</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">the billions level</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">can be at the thousands level and we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">have massive impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">right away and then it&#39;s working finding</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">the people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">to get to be a part of figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">how we actually create a process for 10</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">000 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">and figure out the infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">we need to be able to do that whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s what&#39;s in it for them</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">hyperlogos and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">data mapping and visualization tool uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">which is something i wanted to do for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">many many years and i finally got to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">stage when</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">um i can start showing it more publicly</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">uh possibly get uh some help</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">something like that so uh what&#39;s new for</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">me is basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">getting this thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">done or at least in progress so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">something like now getting my dream real</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">very important to me and um i see it as</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">like doing my own thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">which i will be doing anyway uh but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">this context in context of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">me gaming the possibilities are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">much broader than in like normal</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">um normal context so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">and i hope for it to be useful not only</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">to myself as originally intended but</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">also for</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">other people and yeah for general public</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">hopefully so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">okay so about the third place what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">it for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s it&#39;s more to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">sort of like human connection and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">you don&#39;t need pounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">or algorithms to actually find find each</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">other and to actually create a space</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">that people can drop into without any</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">barriers and help them to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">things that they they want to go up they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">want to go off and do</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">and help them and provide art stuff so i</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">think what&#39;s in it for me is just that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">sensible longing and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">not being left made to feel less than i</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">you know i mean so um and being part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">a bigger network</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">which is connected with others as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">so um i think that&#39;s the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">main thing because the money doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">motivate me at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">i wish it did because then i&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">like yeah you could do this that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">other if i was one of them but um</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t appeal to gay male</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">players because he wouldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">because to them humans don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">much value at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">you know but um tech apps and everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">and whatever yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">they do but i&#39;m more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">and the human connection and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">what&#39;s in it for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">thanks everyone i feel like the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">was also a little um weirdly</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">what&#39;s in it for me</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s in it for me that&#39;s why i&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">but like what&#39;s in it for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">the random new person right like the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">customer</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">that either a gaming or game b like why</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">would they get involved right now right</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">and what would their biggest</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">piece be anyway but that was then i</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">write out the question how it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">heard is how is how it is answered which</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">is how it&#39;s kind of supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">so you can open up the conversation from</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea cafe that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">designed to do each answer</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">then we can have an open conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">and and this is kind of out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">idea cafe but uh just diving right in so</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">marcus have you heard of open global</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">yet yes i heard about it not that i</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just a group of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">trying to create sense making tools as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">community or use</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">since making tools and create them um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">put a link in the chat um but they would</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">be they might be interested in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">what you&#39;ve built and maybe contributing</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">to some of the design if you&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">or just using your tool this designer is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">someone i really really need because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">uh designers i can do some of it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">yeah yeah and they&#39;re really loosely</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">yeah you know it&#39;s a loose group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">people so it might be a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s frustrating to come into</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">a community that all when it&#39;s well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">like game b</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">right everyone wants to do something but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">they all have different ideas on how it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">is but</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;m finding it interesting uh they have</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">have a teaser it won&#39;t be necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">nice to look at and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">a little bit meandering just because of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">how those conversations go</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">but i personally like using that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">thing as like</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">the very first type of content uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">awesome that&#39;s a very good idea and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">what sort of designer are you looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">um well uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">someone who can tell me where the pixels</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">are not right</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">and stuff like um</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">design in terms of user experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">because uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">you know everything that a developer</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">is kind of biased uh especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">like in alone mode uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">totally biased and then someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">experience in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">user interaction uh can take a look and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">okay this is rubbish because a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">standard user is not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">find stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">know how to do like lots of things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">it will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">um i think you you&#39;ve seen it so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">i guess for you it was kind of a weird</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">experience to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">you know yes i broke it um</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">um because the reason why i ask is i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">seen someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">who was ui ux who&#39;s just joined the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">project group so i&#39;ll need to go back</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">then we&#39;ll be able to talk more about</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">the next steps and announcing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">more publicly and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">the person</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">yeah okay i&#39;m forgetting her name</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">because i&#39;ve just seen like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">following her project</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">the was it the two row flow commons</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">if somebody knows her name please um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">but she&#39;s actually like a a ui designer</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">that&#39;s her thing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s like the the the project that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">she&#39;s in game before</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">is the two row uh flow</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">something commons forget the full name</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s her her specialty so</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">that might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">also worth which that might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">thing like if</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">i i from what i&#39;m hearing it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">one of the challenges that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">right now is being able to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">in a way that would get people</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">interested and that might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">outcome from the meeting with</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">with me and bentley is to sort of put</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">that into</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">terms that maybe we can find some</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">snippet somewhere in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">that then you can start to shop that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">that clip around to say hey does this</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">thing sound interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">that would be totally awesome because it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">has so many angles</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s really a project that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:15:00.160" style="s2">started literally 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">uh as something different</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.160" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">but also connected to the general</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">theme of visualization and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s difficult to say what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">it is and what it should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s um yeah it&#39;s way too</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">so uh on the meeting i&#39;ll explain more</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">and when you see it you will understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">perfect i think that will probably be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">a good combo because bentley is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">a developer and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">ui ux focused and i&#39;m not a developer</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">and ui</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">ux focus so that those sort of two sides</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">of that coin</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">i imagine will probably be a good a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">mix for some</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">initial feedback and then if you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">chop that around two</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">still can&#39;t remember her name but like</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">some of the people in the group who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">really you know ui ux will focus and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">trained</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">then that will hopefully get you to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">where you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">so one thing to answer the the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">that started this meeting is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">what&#39;s in it for me and what would be in</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">it for</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">some uh people who have projects or</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">started doing something</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">is getting it to uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">to the public and uh what i mean is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">uh slowly</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">uh do the unveiling of of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">and uh you know because</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">how i feel about um making it more</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">public is</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">there is some kind of uh like fear of uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">embarrassment about uh you know this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">maybe not being uh not having enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">relevance and not being good enough and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">when you work on something for uh long</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">enough it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">feel at least uneasy to uh to make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">public because</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">yeah the dream can be just</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">so uh for everyone who is who is</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">game b setting can be perfect for uh for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">just this</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">uh helping with uh first assessment of</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">and then um</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">helping with uh taking it further</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">from the standalone developer having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">dream mode</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">to uh something that actually works and</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">bit that way keep doing the software</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:55.040" style="s2">development but</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit more fun totally</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">not so much time fiddling with things</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">is user experience something you need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">have a lot of technical background for</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">no it helps to have like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">base but like um not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">yeah like just it just enough so you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">have some conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">but honestly sometimes it actually helps</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">to not have a lot because then</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">exactly the more you have the more that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">you can get like mired and technical</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">with developers and architects and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">sometimes it helps just be able to say i</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">don&#39;t know how it works i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">just here&#39;s how it should look and act</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">to be able to say like i find that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">confusing sometimes it helps to not be</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">technical for that part</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">it does help to be detail-oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">uh as opposed to a like a designer</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">would be more artistically oriented but</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">user experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">it can be like oh this button is is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">too far away from this other button so</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">it does actually get a bit fidgety</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">but like you know moving this button to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">the other side of the screen would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">fewer movements for the person you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">most people right-handed but some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">are left-handed so you need to make it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">switch over there so it&#39;s all about kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">of placement and colors and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">using cognitive science on helping</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">people make</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">apps as useful as possible there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">of studies on</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">contrast and distance um</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">and stuff like that so yeah there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">a lot to be said for trying like</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">for trying to keep with standards across</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">other applications</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">because a lot people carry a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">same sort of training and like how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">use software from app to app and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to reinvent the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">that can be a real barrier to people</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">even though it might make sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">standalone you&#39;re like i think that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">is better</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">if it&#39;s in a huge contrast it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">really hampering adoption</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">yeah sometimes you&#39;ll want to break the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">rules but like that hamburger menu</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">everyone complains about but</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">people are now trained for the last five</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a menu button so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">stuck with it until</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">something else changes kind of like how</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">the the save button is still a floppy</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">disk even though those haven&#39;t existed</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve been overall think of what to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:11.679" style="s2">and then i was having an issue because</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">you can like save to the cloud you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.679" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">save to your desktop you can save it</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">in your browser but if you go to another</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">browser it won&#39;t exist there</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">or if you lose all your cookies and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">history if you erase your history</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">so giving them the concept and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">there&#39;s also like in memory saving like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">did i did i actually make the change to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">the data locally and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">where is it stored in all those three</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">places i&#39;m like wow how do i explain</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s tough the funny thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">even though people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">the floppy disk they now associate that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">we&#39;re saving and like there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">stories from parents who like they saw</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.200" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">a floppy disk and their kid is like oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">cool somebody 3d printed</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">the save icon like no that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">see if icon is based on but</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s kind of like how the phone</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">icon is like the old you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">handset even though most kids have never</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">seen one of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s still like they associate that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">with the phone but the shape is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">completely like why is that the shape</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">now whatever i just associate that with</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">the phone</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;d be funny if the button on a cell</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">phone was a picture of a cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">yes you&#39;re just like what it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">rectangle with icons</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">inside a rectangle with icons et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">right now the thing i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">so what&#39;s the button what&#39;s pressing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">button dude</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually really weird that an</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">entire generation doesn&#39;t know what all</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">these things are i mean i because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">deaf in one ear a lot of people get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">tattoo or something of the speaker with</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">a line through it right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">what mute is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">oh that&#39;s cool and yet speakers also</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t really something that you often</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">see like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re more because you do</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">still have external speakers when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">much better sound but not as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">it was basically given you it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">weird one because the speaker icon is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">part of the speaker that most people</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">don&#39;t see we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">sort of like the cone and the driver and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">you&#39;re like why do we associate that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">well they had to pick an icon and now</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">people know that as the sound even</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">though they don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s always icons that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">associate with something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">most people now couldn&#39;t pinpoint why</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">yet they were only here for a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">small period of our history it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">like we&#39;ve had a phone</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">since you know the eighteen yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t had a phone since</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">now i&#39;m wondering when did the phone get</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">invented again maybe it was the late</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.919" style="s2">1800s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">but like not in the 1700s i will stand</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.919" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">by that there was not a phone</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">and the phone in the 1800s or what</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">whatever it was actually developed</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that form factor it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">that right it was like the separate</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">yeah yeah the cone you held your ear</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">with the cable and the weird thing you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">spoke into</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">i want to make that be the phone icon</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a special psychological term for</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">this like reappropriation of uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">uh and turning into something new</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">so far and yet not so far at the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">the these are the kind what um</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">sharon said today in the game b space</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">something about i mean i read it today</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">actually i don&#39;t know if she said it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">something about the or the difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">being complex and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">and how it&#39;s we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">we can&#39;t orchestrate our way out of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">complicated right one person can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">it can&#39;t be really b</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">it has to be something complex and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s something in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">like it&#39;s just the natural emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">continuing forward that makes these</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">things archaic not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">sitting around deciding do we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">neither do we need an icon that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">to last the test of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">because we would not have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">figure out what those would be or</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">are we going to let these things fall by</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">the wayside they just do</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">i mean the nice thing about using things</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">like the phone receiver and they say</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">you know the the floppy disk is that now</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">but they&#39;ve gone away there kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">won&#39;t be any competition for like things</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">that come back that might</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">confuse it people associate the phone</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">receiver with the phone</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">see something that&#39;s that kind of a form</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">factor</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">immediately make sense for that so even</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">like you don&#39;t really have to know what</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">the phone is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">or what the original thing was you just</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">see phone that&#39;s the icon</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">all right if i see that that icon from</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">now on i&#39;ll know that that&#39;s a phone</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">yeah so we might not need to it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">weird to explain to people like no that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">used to be a thing and now it only means</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">that concept even though you won&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">that physical thing anymore</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like a tombstone of the phone wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s memorial to the phone everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">frozen but me</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">let&#39;s see 26 minutes in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">do we want to just jump to any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">um together tech</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">or uh game b projects discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">yeah we can one of the things we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">bring up which i was doing when i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">off camera</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">is uh one of the things adrian and i</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">talked about after the camera started</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">stopped rolling last time</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">was um if you have other electronic</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">devices</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:20.640" style="s2">putting either the facebook or youtube</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">of us streaming</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">on that device so it looks like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">more people watching so when the odd</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">person pops in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s probably me watching another</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">device the odd person pops and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s all on like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">spotlights on them like it sometimes can</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s two or three people here</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">people feel more likely to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">pop in a note and feel more</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">confident but that&#39;s not no one feels</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">the need</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">it&#39;s an invitation if you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">do that so we&#39;re gonna be ghosting then</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">yeah ghost watching exactly and it also</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">because if there&#39;s up to five either and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">we could have multiple devices like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be ten</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">of us on and it&#39;s just us watching so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">also won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">if anyone&#39;s actually watching it works</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">both ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to feel like someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">and when someone pops in they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">yes i imagine that would probably help</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">with the algorithm in all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">but like afterwards being like oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">more people watch this live so more</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">likely to show it and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">might actually show up for more people</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">during the live</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">version of it like oh you know 10 or 15</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">people are watching this will</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">show it as opposed to if there&#39;s zero or</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">one i i don&#39;t think it really kicks in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">to be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">not many people are interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">because not many people are interested</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">yeah okay there was just one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">wanted to bring up in the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">so i know a few people have said they</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">could do 2 p.m</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">on a saturday alternative weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">so are you wanting to change them and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">can put on the calendar or</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">badly is there any other stuff that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">need to put on the calendar before to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">project one which has all the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">projects and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">events and whatever in the group that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s good except um</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">you know the link i put on there is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">search for the tags</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">and if it&#39;s gonna be too challenging for</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">us i went ahead and tagged the one for</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">today and tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">so they&#39;ll show up in that search so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">could either</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">create a new tag just for events and put</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">that on there and then we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">worry about which one has tags and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">you go to that tag you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">see the events you know that are going</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">on or the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">light or the live stream or just</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">whatever we want to maybe a live stream</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">tag would be better</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">right so we could do that right so just</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">to do the tags for</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">the the board meetings and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">cafes</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">and the round tables yeah so if you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">those then people will find them but if</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">we forget to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">um because it because it&#39;s automatically</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">posted when adriel and jubilee do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">do the post manually it&#39;s not tagged so</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">it won&#39;t show up in the list so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">instructions we gave them to find it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">right okay so we need to either change</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">the instructions or change</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">or add that extra manual step</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">um so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">i wanted to get the main one done first</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">and then go on to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">the second one for the community events</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">like jubilee solution raisins and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">whatever else that was happening now for</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">rather than you having to maintain all</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">that and all the changes</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">um we can i mean maybe for jubilee or</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">for some people but</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">like if we want to have cesare put his</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">and um the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">put because they were posting one in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.799" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">uh we can i generated a link</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">to where anyone who has that link</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">can put events on there all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">no we don&#39;t if we sh we could share it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">in the facebook group on a post but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">everyone on the internet can</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">see it it&#39;s not likely anyone is going</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">to see it</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">just the people in the group and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">anyone could post whatever they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">it just be a free-for-all</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">which is fine because that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">not the main list</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">although i was thinking and i might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">going this too much is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">when you go to the main screen to look</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">at our things</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not i mean there are two different</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">colors but</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.519" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">i&#39;d almost like to have it have two</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">links um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">because two completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">calendars rather than two calendars on</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">the same page</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">you know what i mean two counters on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">same partner that&#39;d be my preference and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">there might even be a way to create a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">link to just view one</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">or the other i think there&#39;s a way just</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">because you can hide you can hide the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">second one</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">you can hide yeah can you post a link</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">that auto hides it right because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">talking about for me it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll be confusing to people people</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to find our events if</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">there&#39;s all these other events going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">so it&#39;d be nice if they have one link</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">for for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">official events and one link for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">project events</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">because i thought that was what was</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">happening anyway so when i go to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">link for the group they both show up at</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re two different colors on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">left hand side</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">and then you can you have to um turn one</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">off to see the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">so it&#39;d be nice if they if and i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">there is a way to make a link to where</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">you can only see one and length</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">yeah like keep them together adding</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">something to the url that indicates</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">which thing to enable or disable or</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">because i know you can create other</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">calendars but i don&#39;t know whether they</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">would show up on the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">the same link but i think you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">actually create</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">a different link or maybe if i set up</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">another group</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">but for that yeah so yeah give it a</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">separate</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">separate link yeah we may have to set up</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">a separate group in which case the link</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">i created</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">to let people create won&#39;t work because</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.279" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll have to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">do a new one but but i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">option and then we could just share it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">through a private chat someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">posting a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">just chatted to them say hey throw your</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">events on</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">yeah i think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">oh also i don&#39;t know if we can within</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">the calendar because i know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">they&#39;re color quoted for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">versus not</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">um but as a participant between which</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">ones</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">criteria is to watch it</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">criteria&#39;s probably not high to watch it</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">the criteria to participate</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">where i can watch it if i live and where</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">i can watch it if it&#39;s if i can watch it</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the calendar can</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">necessarily do all that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">in the descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re putting the event up right you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">can you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">create a page that would show it all up</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">in the description bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">yes i&#39;m just wondering if like on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">calendar if i could see</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know i know with the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">you have to be a member of them right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the criteria i think to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">be part of it but they might have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">odd event you don&#39;t need to be a cri</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">a member of to be able to see that so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to click on all of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">stones to find the odd one</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">like to kind of say like maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">only for ones that are open so people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">come in and participate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">because i would think it would be better</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">on screen for people who are open</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">without them having to to join anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">that would be the criteria</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">of sort of like having it just for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">people because like obviously you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">putting stuff up there that people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">got to get through</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">all sorts of other stuff to get to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">because then that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">kind of game b really is it because i</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">thought game b was about being open to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">yeah no it&#39;s my game b it&#39;s not a slight</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">for the stole one you can register and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">not be a member and go to those</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s a fair point we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">tell anyone posting any things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">only post things that you might have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">register for but</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">um that you you can that anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">attend that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">barrier</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">so i guess i don&#39;t care if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">look to see if there&#39;s a way to separate</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">those two calendars</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll do i will have a look at that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">until we got the first one sorted and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">what what so are you happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">first one then</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">i think so and to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">yeah actually i don&#39;t know if that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">jubilee&#39;s point or i just misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">her but</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">yeah on each one of those they can they</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">can go and see the playlists</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">that apply to them so they can always</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">catch up on the older ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">and then there&#39;s instructions on how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">get the stream yard link</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">so the strategy round table then when it</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">when are you wanting to start the 2pm</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">or do you want to get a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">information first</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">i think we can try our first one a week</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">i was going to do tomorrow then i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">like it&#39;s probably a little too close we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t told people</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">that tomorrow will be 9 a.m and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">let people know</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">also that we&#39;ll hold the next week we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">do 2pm because now that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">calendar</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:09.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it was confusing to have fridays be</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">every other one is a board meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">an idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">and on saturdays every other one is nine</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">and two without having a calendar to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">show them which one&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">right which i don&#39;t know how it might be</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">easier to have it be the first second</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">the first third and fifth saturday are 9</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">a.m and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">the third well the other two</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">are the second and fourth</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like the odds on nine a.m and there</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">you go the odds are on 9</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">i would want to a.m to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">the repeating</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">function in the calendar app we use can</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">handle that easily so someone&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">having oh well i think so but you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">have to set up the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">satisfaction you have to give him a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">number right because i know we did it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">the board meetings and the idea cafe so</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">we had to set them up as separate</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">yeah from the same you know just we</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">carry it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">one every two weeks you could do the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">same with with the boards</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">meetings but i would need to number them</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">or some way of sort of like generating</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">different ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">for those two two weeks you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">then it would fill them in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">and you could i don&#39;t know it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">not appropriate to say morning and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">evening but</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s not morning in the evening</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">for some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">um maybe just call it a second</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">calibric road because it&#39;s it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">and australia and new zealand day so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">call it the yellow brick road</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">table homes like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">the kiwi uh kiwi week</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">okay anyone in that side of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">hemisphere is also welcome to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">creating things that are like more on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">that side&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">time zone it&#39;s just because it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">a little north american-centric to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">during our day and it&#39;s like it has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">fit in</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">heaven forbid you have the australians</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">and then the europeans working together</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">we have to keep them separate well it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">will be on our time</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;ll be funny because they&#39;ll be from</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll be talking to them and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">reporting back from the future</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">yeah and i was thinking it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">going to be confusing</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">uh so i guess everything&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">pacific time right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">but when the time zones change for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">people in the other</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">every time this happens it&#39;s a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">between all the conversations we</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">schedule</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">it takes about four weeks to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">everything re-read</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">like they all change at different times</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">well what are they to put the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">the current set of meetings to the end</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">of october</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s when british summer time</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">because i thought well if i go past</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">the changing and i thought nah so i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">did it to the end of october</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">till it changed and then then put</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">another set in because obviously people</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">have got</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know when daylight time starts</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:17.839" style="s2">time i changed the time zone to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">all and then mine yeah oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.839" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">oh earlier we did not have the auto</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">detect on and then i found it and turned</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">it on so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">i let&#39;s i&#39;d try that until people</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">complain and just tell them to</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">be careful and check look in the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">hand bottom right hand um</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">and then carrie i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">noticed that adriel posted two links</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">one has the calendar highlighted and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">really like that because then you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">the option to see both calendars or just</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">and then in the introduction i would put</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">them as two separate calendars</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">for new people they see that and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">maybe post if you want to see them all</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">in one calendar</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">here&#39;s that link and i can probably edit</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">introduction although i want to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">sure that you feel comfortable editing</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">that information</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">well you know i&#39;m quite happy with what</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">you do because you you have a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">to put things better</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">because me saying oh there you go</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a link that&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.740" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">although sometimes i get busy and well</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">if you get busy just just let me know</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">technical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not too sure what to do with and as</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">i said i was just going to add it to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">the page that you know the welcome</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">welcome page thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got in docs you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">oh that&#39;s what i was talking about i</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">think yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">you&#39;re better explaining things in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">business sense whereas i&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">business sense at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">so look knock yourself out doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">wash quite well with uh people who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">businessly minded</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">yeah and just to uh to get those links</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">all you do is use the side panel on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">left like you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">add keywords you can select the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">and then when you want to do that just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">hit share</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">and it opens up a new tab with all that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">criteria in the url</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">and then you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">and then uh if you want to get fancy</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">after the the question mark like</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">the teamup.com id question mark</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">each of those things is a is a separate</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">thing separated by an ampersand</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">or by the end and then you can pick and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">choose like i just sort of stripped out</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">all the stuff that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">the calendar is equal and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">how we got to just calendars</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">i can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re using google</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">calendar as an actual base for the work</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">they did or if they just copied the heck</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">but either way it works unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">their logo looks more like a calculator</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">than a calendar but</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">oh yeah i&#39;m like calculator oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">no okay it&#39;s a calendar</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a lot like a calculator i</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t even notice that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">they should have just left the top as</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">circles and it would have been more</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">well i think they&#39;re trying to be clever</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">and make a t out of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">yeah for team up so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">yeah i guess maybe they could have just</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">not had to be a bar and had it be</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">bubbles as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">i i think that would be a little clearer</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">but for</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">seven days is still an odd number and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">they could have had a t</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">with seven but that&#39;s a lot of dots for</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">a logo</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">but seven is a week and therefore a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">calendar and three is very much a number</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">pad calculator</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point the only thing is i</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know if there&#39;s enough room on</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">because they also use it as an icon</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">for the browser tab yeah which then</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">you can make it smaller yeah because i</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">think you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">do the favicons i think you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">make them 32 by</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">32. and then yeah they would be smaller</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">dots but the question is when they are</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">we now solving team</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">calendars do look like calculators so</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">uh what they need to do is change the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">icon to something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">um in the spirit of um old devices</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">uh giving uh shape to icons uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">of modern internet they should be using</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">something like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">paper scroll or something i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">what what people used</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">like long time ago for calendars</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">like books paper actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">a sundial yeah that&#39;s what i was trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">to think yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">there we go we&#39;ll use this seven</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">using icons for old things that people</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they are anymore yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">let&#39;s go all the way back to the sundial</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">maybe it is there any s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">tools out there that are free forever</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">that you know of nothing&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">nothing&#39;s free no such thing as if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">either pay for it or you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">or the goods being sold but no sorry</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s why eventually we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">to create one and if someone has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.839" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">create one that&#39;s free and readily</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">available and good</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">or we have to create it like because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:25.839" style="s2">we have hundreds of people on something</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">paying</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.839" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">tens of thousands of dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense but recreating it for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">tens of thousands of dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">absolutely does</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">okay it&#39;s just that ivana posted that</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">you know because obviously the chat</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">around the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">creating a funding business or what have</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">you invested in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">um mentioned did was there such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t think there was because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">know there&#39;s maybe a three</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">three so like sign up for 30 days</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">and then after that you get charged for</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">every member of the team</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">you know i mean when you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">what the team&#39;s gonna be yet you know so</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s very common of course</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">funny this is why we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">to protect them because it is we like</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">how do these things exist when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">looking for them trying to recreate them</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">and still</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">even when we&#39;re looking for them we</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">can&#39;t find them like</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">there needs to be one central place to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">go and be like what are</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">the reasons is that those companies</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">offer free tools have to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">companies that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">only offer paid tools and the companies</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">offer paid tools are going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.440" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">you know pay for advertising and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">seo and of course that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">like not we is in the five of us but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">as in collective humanity need to solve</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">that problem to have one depository</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">repo repository to go to for</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">one reason i find them is actually when</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">i fall across</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">people doing projects and stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">they go and have a nose and if they</p>

<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">it was mostly free trials for</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">a period of time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">yeah yeah so and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">canonical debate lab group and they all</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.079" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">are trying to keep track of all these</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">people in the space that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">things like when kiala came out</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">and stuff we were like oh no um and open</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">global mind actually wants to use</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">so i think this is really need for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">generic kind of app</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">to where you could have community a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">driven um</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">directories searchable directories and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">not just like random search but where</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">you can do rating and you can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">um categories like you you could say you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">know it&#39;s good at this and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">this is x you can you can just</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">fight then for that then say that again</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">it would just be a listing</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">listed what it would be it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">closest i would think would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">um and y&#39;all i don&#39;t know if this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">just us based is a consumer reports</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re going to buy a fridge and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">says okay so this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">you can look at just the fidgets that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">are 13.5 cubic feet</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">right cubic meters sorry for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">uh yeah and so you could narrow things</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">down by that and then also you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">rate it by like quality and easy to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">repair and all this different stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">um but but having that be community</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">driven</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">rather than you know paying researchers</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">right i think there&#39;s no system for that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">in terms of community tools then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">have it like</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">free for the what&#39;s free for 30 days</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:02.160" style="s2">it was free forever you&#39;d have the free</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">trial and the free tiers and which</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.160" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">features cost what</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">yeah okay i think it would end up being</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">quite close to captera but without the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">the game aids stand i think characters</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">started out being what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">and then they found out oh we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">monetize this well i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">i mean they have reviews but it&#39;s not i</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">quite community driven true</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">yeah yeah but right yeah so like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:29.839" style="s2">community-powered captain but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">with the idea of you can look for</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.839" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">for like the main features and one</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">product can have multiple features and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">people can vote on it</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">and so i think it would be roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">same but with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">fair number of changes like it being</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">community driven and it being all about</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.760" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">is it good at serving the this purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">not is this company paying us to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">yeah which is largely what kept here it</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:57.200" style="s2">is now unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">does that fit anything within your</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.200" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">system as far as the same thing because</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">you have organizations</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">you have companies are you going to want</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">to rate them on different metrics</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">at some point in the future so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">same tech</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just companies rather than products</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.839" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">or um</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">totally yeah and long term i&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">plan sort of under a different</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">umbrella but still sort of the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:24.160" style="s2">database where you&#39;d be able to look at</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">the products offered by a company um</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.160" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">more for physical products but it would</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">actually be easier to do it</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">for for digital ones so all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:34.799" style="s2">right well i&#39;ll have a look at this as</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:36.440" style="s2">well because i know i think i did look</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">at this because i was looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.440" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">crm software and i went through the list</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">and then i looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">the project management software and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s out there yeah i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">that why captera really</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">it just hurts my brain whenever i look</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">at it it&#39;s not that it&#39;s too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s something about their display or</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.839" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">to what open it no i</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">no i&#39;m i don&#39;t have a bias against</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">corporate right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">i just like game b but i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">no it&#39;s just i think they&#39;re filtering</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">and sorting and searching</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">just it&#39;s like almost detailed enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">but not quite and so it&#39;s this uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">valley it&#39;s like oh just give me a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">search box or give me full control but</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">um yeah so they have like free and free</p>

<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">alternative uh two dot net the home page</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">like if you scroll down they just got a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">list of sort of the most common</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">applications so like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">you can go look at alternatives to</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.559" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">what kind of license yeah alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">team up calendar they of course have</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">google calendar apple calendar</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">simple calendar mind time one calendar</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.200" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">web calendar digical</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">something called calendar what is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">about humans that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s 2020 and we still for such</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">a basic functionality</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">and i think it goes to the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">thing that it took us so long to find</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">team up is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">everybody wants to sort of have their</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">say and have their version of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">and unfortunately with game a they end</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">up wanting to monetize it and then that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">can kind of pollute the end purpose</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">and so you end up with you know a</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">million different alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">to these alternative seeking tools but</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">such a thing as calendar just</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">awesome yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">yeah oh so did we decide did we want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">just put everything on utc and not</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">change it</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">and everyone gets an hour off every</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">summer</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">or winter however you look at it summer</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">i guess because it&#39;s a shorter period</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">well as i said the current ones goes to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">october so i don&#39;t know after october do</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">you want to change it then</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">just leave it as it is for now well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:30.799" style="s2">going to be confusing</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">oh cause i because i don&#39;t know doing it</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.799" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">at utc</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">i also think there&#39;s like a million</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">apocalypses that are going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">between now and october</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">so who knows what time changes will</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">happen between them</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">utc one there was two for usa in canada</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">and i just didn&#39;t know which one was</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">no there&#39;s a there&#39;s a utc utc it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.400" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">those are utc plus six and utc plus</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:59.359" style="s2">something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">just utc right that&#39;s the one without</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.359" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">time zones</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s the one we&#39;d want to switch it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">to and then i would just have them go on</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">forever and hopefully remember to turn</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">it off if we ever stop doing a meeting</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">right okay where is the utc thing taking</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">like is that just the default you mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">or is that like</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">when we&#39;re listing the time in like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">or where is utc you have to also</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:23.680" style="s2">anytime you put it in the text and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">have pdt or pst</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">we&#39;d probably need to change that to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">utc time</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">and people are just going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">look it up like everyone who&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:37.680" style="s2">pdt pst right pacific time</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">i see so that&#39;s mostly when like either</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.680" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">the default of the calendar if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">if the auto sensing isn&#39;t working it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">would default to utc</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">anytime that we&#39;re like typing out you</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">this meeting is at this time on this day</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:53.680" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">in in utc yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">okay i think that that makes sense while</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">we&#39;re at it i suggest for the group we</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">to base six numbers instead of base 10</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.599" end="01:02:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s much more efficient you can because</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">you can divide it into thirds more</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.119" end="01:02:11.119" style="s2">easily without having a rounding</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">decimal right we&#39;re good how about phase</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.119" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">12. i feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s better so the guy the guy</p>
