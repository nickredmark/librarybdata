<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:12.920" style="s2">take to teach this course online because</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:15.920" style="s2">without all of the relational</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.700" end="00:05:43.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s gonna be two three-hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">sessions but is it okay with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.640" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">if we actually keep that open because if</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:58.040" style="s2">well it turned out to be five because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">took that much longer to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.040" end="00:06:05.900" style="s2">know saturate through the screen and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:08.420" style="s2">mean you know right now on your screen</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.810" end="00:06:23.880" style="s2">and just how much information is missing</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:30.050" style="s2">I often refer to that information as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.880" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">warm data so it took a lot longer than</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.050" end="00:06:35.220" style="s2">it would have if we had been in person I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">think that&#39;s interesting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:41.690" style="s2">happening with this relationship to time</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:44.820" style="s2">and if our relationship to time changes</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">that changes relationships to everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.820" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">and if relationships to everything start</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:53.760" style="s2">changing you start to get significant</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:56.250" style="s2">change and the the thing about that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.760" end="00:06:58.139" style="s2">that I&#39;m not exactly sure where to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.250" end="00:07:00.600" style="s2">looking for that change what to call it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.139" end="00:07:05.660" style="s2">how to identify it where to measure it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.600" end="00:07:08.820" style="s2">how to even register what that change is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.660" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">because it seems like it&#39;s slipping out</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.820" end="00:07:14.970" style="s2">of whatever context I go to find it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:17.430" style="s2">so I think to myself I&#39;m gonna pay</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.970" end="00:07:21.389" style="s2">attention to how my relationship to food</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.430" end="00:07:26.070" style="s2">and time is changing and then I start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.389" end="00:07:31.169" style="s2">realize well in fact that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.070" end="00:07:34.380" style="s2">is is contingent upon you know what kind</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:39.970" style="s2">of the periphery I just sort of thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">well you know everyone&#39;s home with their</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.190" end="00:10:56.260" style="s2">think about how generations can together</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.510" end="00:11:02.050" style="s2">explore the complexity and the systemics</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.260" end="00:11:06.360" style="s2">of this and this is a personal plight</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.050" end="00:11:11.020" style="s2">for me because because I was a kid who</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.360" end="00:11:13.480" style="s2">grew up in a household in which it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.020" end="00:11:16.390" style="s2">important to always be looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:19.990" style="s2">inter dependency of life that that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.390" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">just how it was we did that and that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.990" end="00:11:23.740" style="s2">breakfast and that was the fish tank and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:29.080" style="s2">that was a walk in the woods and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.740" end="00:11:33.550" style="s2">was the reading of a story so there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.080" end="00:11:36.220" style="s2">no separation ever between this process</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.550" end="00:11:41.260" style="s2">of inquiry into the complexity of life</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.220" end="00:11:46.450" style="s2">from the time I was tiny and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.260" end="00:11:50.790" style="s2">that whole body of a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.450" end="00:12:01.420" style="s2">intellectual material was actually just</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.790" end="00:12:03.720" style="s2">life it was a way of being and and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.420" end="00:12:03.720" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.779" end="00:12:11.160" style="s2">we went to school and when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.529" end="00:12:14.610" style="s2">school I had to learn to break the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.160" end="00:12:16.290" style="s2">into pieces and that math was something</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.610" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">different and music was something</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.290" end="00:12:23.370" style="s2">different than then literature was</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:28.769" style="s2">something different than history and etc</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.370" end="00:12:31.230" style="s2">and and then I was frustrated by that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.769" end="00:12:35.089" style="s2">and I could feel as a child I could just</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.230" end="00:12:44.040" style="s2">feel the kind of the magic of life just</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.089" end="00:12:47.069" style="s2">sucking out and I hated school so I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.040" end="00:12:50.069" style="s2">just sort of thought okay let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.069" end="00:12:53.699" style="s2">just do this I get very frustrated when</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.069" end="00:12:56.249" style="s2">I hear people saying things like well</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.699" end="00:12:58.829" style="s2">you know you have to be you know an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.249" end="00:13:01.769" style="s2">adult with this level of development to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.829" end="00:13:04.019" style="s2">actually comprehend complexity and most</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.769" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">of the time there&#39;s the at least</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.019" end="00:13:13.290" style="s2">implication that that you&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:16.350" style="s2">some level of academic proficiency to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.290" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">that and it just you know I I find that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.350" end="00:13:22.230" style="s2">intolerable because of course every</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:25.379" style="s2">culture in the world has been dealing</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.230" end="00:13:28.050" style="s2">with complexity forever at all ages so</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.379" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you know certainly in terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.050" end="00:13:33.350" style="s2">of the jargon if you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">the mathematics of redundancies and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.350" end="00:13:38.699" style="s2">couplings and you know some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.949" style="s2">more jargon istic versions of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.699" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">about mapping complexity for example in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.949" end="00:13:50.189" style="s2">the way that that particular pista mala</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:53.339" style="s2">ji creates that but bottom line and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.189" end="00:13:55.800" style="s2">breakfast is complex bottom line to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.339" end="00:13:58.350" style="s2">in relationship in a family as a complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:03.350" style="s2">process to walk across the room requires</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.350" end="00:14:07.079" style="s2">an embodiment of complexity so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.350" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">begin to open that space of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.079" end="00:14:12.779" style="s2">learning between generations</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:16.819" style="s2">so I started this Monday after Monday</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.779" end="00:14:17.610" style="s2">evening thing and I&#39;ll give you the link</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.209" end="00:14:27.309" style="s2">and this weird thing happened because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.319" end="00:14:30.490" style="s2">had actually no idea how radical it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.309" end="00:14:33.339" style="s2">going to be because in all the previous</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.490" end="00:14:36.100" style="s2">iterations of me discussing education in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.339" end="00:14:39.699" style="s2">one form or another I&#39;ve had to stay</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:43.059" style="s2">tethered to the existing education</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.699" end="00:14:45.339" style="s2">system in some way shape or form that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.059" end="00:14:47.709" style="s2">was at a conference or I was working</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.339" end="00:14:50.889" style="s2">with parents or you know there was some</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.709" end="00:14:54.899" style="s2">reason in which I was having this</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.889" end="00:15:00.519" style="s2">conversation and and I had to stay in</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.519" end="00:15:08.559" style="s2">system but in this zoom session suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.569" end="00:15:12.790" style="s2">that was gone and I and it was so</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.559" end="00:15:17.970" style="s2">surprising to me because I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.790" end="00:15:21.009" style="s2">just like actually I mean actually just</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.970" end="00:15:22.869" style="s2">talking about my real experience of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.009" end="00:15:25.449" style="s2">learning complexity as a little kid and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.869" end="00:15:30.279" style="s2">working with my own kids and and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.449" end="00:15:34.089" style="s2">that has really happened how it really</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.279" end="00:15:36.429" style="s2">happened and not in any way looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.089" end="00:15:38.319" style="s2">it through the lens of the school system</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.429" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">or what the school system could be or</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.319" end="00:15:42.100" style="s2">how to adjust the school system or what</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">a curriculum of systems thinking would</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.100" end="00:15:54.040" style="s2">look like her none of that it was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:59.560" style="s2">free of that so what is submerging</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.040" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">right so that is that was a a cue to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.560" end="00:16:05.530" style="s2">that something had actually shifted that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t aware had shifted that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.530" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">somewhere there had been a moving of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:16.900" style="s2">lands and of even the because it was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:20.410" style="s2">collective - you know it&#39;s a group maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.900" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">a little bigger than this group that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.410" end="00:16:26.980" style="s2">that were ready to engage with this</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:34.260" style="s2">thing at a level that it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:39.790" style="s2">unprecedented something&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.260" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I think after being in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.790" end="00:16:49.170" style="s2">kind of circles of change making for</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:52.690" style="s2">actually just too long and and my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.170" end="00:17:02.140" style="s2">family&#39;s been working toward bringing</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.690" end="00:17:03.730" style="s2">change for generations and I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.140" end="00:17:07.150" style="s2">not sure the change is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.730" end="00:17:12.670" style="s2">looking I&#39;m starting to increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.150" end="00:17:16.199" style="s2">feel that one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.670" end="00:17:21.850" style="s2">aspects of responding to complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.199" end="00:17:25.630" style="s2">recognizing that you can&#39;t get at it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.850" end="00:17:29.110" style="s2">directly that that thing you want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.630" end="00:17:31.570" style="s2">change is only possible because of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.110" end="00:17:34.300" style="s2">the many interdependencies that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.570" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">produced it and so if you try to change</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.300" end="00:17:43.309" style="s2">the thing you&#39;re making an error</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s a pretty significant error and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.309" end="00:17:47.570" style="s2">this is something that I you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:49.850" style="s2">honestly I&#39;m not sure that I would have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.570" end="00:17:51.590" style="s2">said this out loud to a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.850" end="00:17:54.049" style="s2">like yourselves that I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.590" end="00:17:57.470" style="s2">know that have probably devoted your</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.470" end="00:18:09.290" style="s2">there is room for something else to come</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.040" end="00:18:11.690" style="s2">out now and I have no idea how to really</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:14.890" style="s2">express where those boundaries have</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.690" end="00:18:17.809" style="s2">moved but they moved</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.890" end="00:18:21.910" style="s2">so what&#39;s submerging what&#39;s going down</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.809" end="00:18:27.100" style="s2">in there why is it suddenly in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.910" end="00:18:32.150" style="s2">conversation right here well what is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.100" end="00:18:35.720" style="s2">that makes it okay it go further than</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.150" end="00:18:37.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve been before to say things you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.720" end="00:18:40.940" style="s2">about the difficult ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.850" end="00:18:43.070" style="s2">systemic you change in which change in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.940" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">complex systems really takes place which</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.070" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not gonna be on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:52.520" style="s2">blackboard it&#39;s not going to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">YouTube video it&#39;s not gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.520" end="00:18:58.460" style="s2">medium right the changes that are really</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:01.070" style="s2">taking place are taking place at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.460" end="00:19:07.429" style="s2">frequency that none of those frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.070" end="00:19:09.980" style="s2">can register and and and that&#39;s us and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.429" end="00:19:12.679" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow here like we&#39;re sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.980" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">now on Zoo but if you were to look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.679" end="00:19:19.880" style="s2">the transcript of this talk you probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:22.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t find it where is it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.880" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">something that&#39;s emerging in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.280" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">relationships but it&#39;s not just my words</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">it&#39;s also your</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.680" end="00:19:35.920" style="s2">and the history and the culture the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:37.810" style="s2">education system that we had to sit</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.920" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">through that sucked the magic out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.810" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">life and then maybe put some back in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.540" end="00:19:56.970" style="s2">the the changes that are emerging are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.140" end="00:19:59.490" style="s2">submerging so I just wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.970" end="00:20:01.260" style="s2">there because it&#39;s because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.490" end="00:20:03.870" style="s2">difficult and impossible to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.260" end="00:20:07.470" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about it you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.870" end="00:20:09.540" style="s2">unasked questions let&#39;s go there so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.470" end="00:20:12.330" style="s2">like to open it up now and just see I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.540" end="00:20:15.330" style="s2">think that was 20 minutes but let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">let&#39;s see where it goes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.330" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">beautiful yeah so we&#39;re opening up to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:21.510" style="s2">all the questions from people in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:23.940" style="s2">room if you would like to put your on</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.510" end="00:20:26.160" style="s2">ask questions in the chat and then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.940" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">will call on you and you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.160" end="00:20:31.470" style="s2">little bit of a dialogue with with Nora</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:34.440" style="s2">and until then Nora I just have some</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.470" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">questions I&#39;ve been really drawn in by</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.440" end="00:20:39.240" style="s2">your question that I hear you say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:40.620" style="s2">heard you said on Jim Wright show I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.240" end="00:20:42.810" style="s2">heard you say it on else all of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.620" end="00:20:44.190" style="s2">kind of like you know logo centric kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.810" end="00:20:46.200" style="s2">of like brains you&#39;re really interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.190" end="00:20:47.670" style="s2">in systems you know and you always come</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.200" end="00:20:49.950" style="s2">back to this question of who&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.670" end="00:20:51.660" style="s2">care of the babies and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:53.730" style="s2">question really gets into the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.660" end="00:20:57.900" style="s2">you know the stickiness the gooeyness</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.730" end="00:20:59.490" style="s2">like this inter place of between which I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.900" end="00:21:01.170" style="s2">would say this kind of liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.490" end="00:21:03.830" style="s2">that we&#39;re in right now is also a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.170" end="00:21:07.590" style="s2">of between space that maybe it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.830" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">allowing for the liminal spaces in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.590" end="00:21:11.910" style="s2">the mundane lives that we live to come</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:15.300" style="s2">to the floor since we have this larger</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.910" end="00:21:17.310" style="s2">liminal space that we&#39;re in but that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.300" end="00:21:20.940" style="s2">question to me seems like it goes on</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.310" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">unasked and unanswered in most places</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.940" end="00:21:24.870" style="s2">and I was wondering if you could link</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:26.550" style="s2">those things in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.870" end="00:21:28.890" style="s2">intergenerational knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.550" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">question why do you ask that question</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.890" end="00:21:36.810" style="s2">and what what is asking that question</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:41.970" style="s2">taught you okay so the the place where</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.810" end="00:21:45.420" style="s2">that question comes from well it comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.970" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">from the basic question of what is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.420" end="00:21:51.570" style="s2">what is continuing I mean what does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:55.670" style="s2">mean to continue and in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.570" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">continue the babies have to be fed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.670" end="00:22:01.809" style="s2">in order for the babies to be fed</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:05.379" style="s2">babies have to be fed in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.809" end="00:22:07.929" style="s2">they could feed their babies and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.379" end="00:22:10.269" style="s2">the people who are helping to produce</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.929" end="00:22:13.629" style="s2">all the processes it requires to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.269" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">babies can feed their babies and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.629" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">their babies can feed babies so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interdependency in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:29.350" style="s2">notion of even just the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">continuance of the human species and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.350" end="00:22:37.480" style="s2">you are into the sustainable development</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:39.489" style="s2">goals you could actually just ask one</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.480" end="00:22:41.799" style="s2">question how are we going to feed the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.489" end="00:22:45.070" style="s2">babies and it&#39;s actually every single</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.799" end="00:22:47.379" style="s2">one of the UN sustainable development</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.070" end="00:22:49.690" style="s2">goals runs through that question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.379" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">gender question it&#39;s a food question</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.690" end="00:22:53.769" style="s2">it&#39;s a soil question it&#39;s an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:57.129" style="s2">question it&#39;s a poverty question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.769" end="00:23:05.799" style="s2">it&#39;s is education it&#39;s it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.129" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">thing is right there so it shows that in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.799" end="00:23:10.509" style="s2">order for there to be continuance</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:12.489" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna have to be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.509" end="00:23:16.690" style="s2">substantial discontinuance</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.489" end="00:23:20.769" style="s2">of all the things that are making it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.690" end="00:23:22.809" style="s2">prohibitive I mean what are the babies</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.769" end="00:23:30.100" style="s2">being fed even in the most wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.809" end="00:23:32.460" style="s2">households right and so taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.100" end="00:23:43.450" style="s2">the babies besides that I have six kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.460" end="00:23:46.269" style="s2">so as an aside you know I have two in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.450" end="00:23:47.649" style="s2">house or so we&#39;ve got six and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.269" end="00:23:52.259" style="s2">you know coming from different cultures</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.649" end="00:23:56.499" style="s2">and all different ages and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.259" end="00:24:01.720" style="s2">all kinds of craziness in that the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.499" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">thing is that that I grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.720" end="00:24:07.779" style="s2">household as I was saying before in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:11.139" style="s2">which there was an ongoing mutual</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.779" end="00:24:12.610" style="s2">learning between the generations so my</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.139" end="00:24:15.549" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.610" end="00:24:17.740" style="s2">some of you may be aware of his work but</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.549" end="00:24:23.350" style="s2">he was one of the people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">started system sciences and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.350" end="00:24:32.760" style="s2">understatement</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">but in our household there was always</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.760" end="00:24:41.830" style="s2">learning and and that I mean it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:45.100" style="s2">kind of romantic but the fact is it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.830" end="00:24:47.140" style="s2">just what was so in some households you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.100" end="00:24:50.380" style="s2">know you have a kind of currency in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.140" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">household of who&#39;s right right</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.380" end="00:24:57.610" style="s2">in our household there was a currency of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:59.260" style="s2">what did you learn can you express</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.610" end="00:25:01.390" style="s2">something that you saw for the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.260" end="00:25:03.940" style="s2">time or something you perceived that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.390" end="00:25:05.830" style="s2">hadn&#39;t perceived before or even better</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.940" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">something you thought was one way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.830" end="00:25:12.160" style="s2">turned out to be another it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:14.919" style="s2">matter what it was as little as we&#39;re as</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.160" end="00:25:18.190" style="s2">big as profound or as banal it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.919" end="00:25:23.410" style="s2">matter but just that process of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.190" end="00:25:26.980" style="s2">constantly being curious and and looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.410" end="00:25:31.110" style="s2">from another direction and my dad would</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.980" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">do this and he would actually articulate</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.110" end="00:25:36.220" style="s2">things like I used to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:39.030" style="s2">like this and now I see it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.220" end="00:25:41.020" style="s2">or isn&#39;t that interesting that you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.030" end="00:25:43.000" style="s2">pointing that out I&#39;m gonna give that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.020" end="00:25:44.890" style="s2">some thought and sure enough he&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.000" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">back to me a day or two later and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.890" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">and I&#39;ve taken it very seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.140" end="00:25:56.110" style="s2">these are the thoughts I have about what</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:59.650" style="s2">you said what do you think about these</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.110" end="00:26:06.970" style="s2">thoughts and this is when I was teeny</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.650" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">you know five six so there was a there</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.970" end="00:26:12.490" style="s2">was not the concerned that he could you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:15.700" style="s2">know that I would disrespect him if he</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.490" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">were wrong on the contrary the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:21.970" style="s2">more to the point that if he were able</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:24.630" style="s2">to change his mind he would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.970" end="00:26:24.630" style="s2">more trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.640" end="00:26:30.590" style="s2">which is well you know that&#39;s pretty</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.389" end="00:29:25.539" style="s2">hard thing is that that there&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.269" end="00:29:29.889" style="s2">much there&#39;s been so much damage there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.539" end="00:29:37.210" style="s2">been so much pain and it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.889" end="00:29:41.529" style="s2">a curious thing about evolution where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.210" end="00:29:43.239" style="s2">share our pain when someone gets hurt</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.239" end="00:29:49.659" style="s2">because of their hurt right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:52.629" style="s2">an evolutionary question in that about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.659" end="00:29:55.239" style="s2">what where does our where what can we</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.629" end="00:30:00.039" style="s2">learn from that hurt and how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.239" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">into an interdependent way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.039" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">it where is that hurt is that hurt</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:06.999" style="s2">really yours or did it come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:09.029" style="s2">economy did it come out of politics did</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.999" end="00:30:12.190" style="s2">it come out of this intra systemic</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.029" end="00:30:15.629" style="s2">madness that we&#39;ve been living in for</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.190" end="00:30:15.629" style="s2">the past several generations</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.380" end="00:30:22.210" style="s2">yeah so that I just said a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:24.610" style="s2">things in there that we could unpack for</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.210" end="00:30:26.620" style="s2">a very long time but but nevertheless I</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.610" end="00:30:28.360" style="s2">see that there&#39;s all this text coming up</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.620" end="00:30:30.400" style="s2">on the side of my screen and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.360" end="00:30:32.800" style="s2">read any of it so give me just a second</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.400" end="00:30:35.080" style="s2">unless you know in reading it and you&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.560" end="00:31:03.790" style="s2">getting a chance to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.970" end="00:31:05.770" style="s2">one of my role models Nora Bateson um so</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.790" end="00:31:07.030" style="s2">my question is basically you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.770" end="00:31:09.160" style="s2">been in a lot of these kind of like game</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.030" end="00:31:10.690" style="s2">be systems change circles under</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.160" end="00:31:13.960" style="s2">different attitudes towards how we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.690" end="00:31:16.090" style="s2">should orient ourselves towards politics</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.960" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">into the political and some people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.090" end="00:31:18.400" style="s2">ones that are kind of like don&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:19.990" style="s2">with it at all the whole system is</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.400" end="00:31:21.850" style="s2">screwed so just focus on going to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.990" end="00:31:23.260" style="s2">local decentralized project and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.850" end="00:31:25.660" style="s2">there&#39;s some collapses hopefully they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.260" end="00:31:27.970" style="s2">be in place to kind of offer and other</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.660" end="00:31:29.380" style="s2">people are more of that accurate of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.970" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">but we we can&#39;t really ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.380" end="00:31:33.010" style="s2">political and its implications and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.750" style="s2">impacting the larger system as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.010" end="00:31:37.260" style="s2">convener connected entity so we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.750" end="00:31:40.600" style="s2">focus on so I&#39;m kind of curious how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.260" end="00:31:42.310" style="s2">what kind of how do you think it would</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.600" end="00:31:44.740" style="s2">be helpful to relate or orient ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.310" end="00:31:49.240" style="s2">towards politics and also to calibrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.740" end="00:31:50.920" style="s2">the impact of policy on catalyzing some</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.240" end="00:31:52.300" style="s2">of the positive change we want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.920" end="00:31:57.730" style="s2">the world such that you&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.300" end="00:31:59.590" style="s2">now or in your book thank you that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.730" end="00:32:02.170" style="s2">great question I just want to run away</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.590" end="00:32:04.870" style="s2">from it though but I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.170" end="00:32:08.130" style="s2">I won&#39;t I will sit here in the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.870" end="00:32:08.130" style="s2">I will be with that question</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.340" end="00:32:14.950" style="s2">the thing is I think we that that this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.090" end="00:32:16.990" style="s2">is a great question to come into from</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.950" end="00:32:20.700" style="s2">that last piece that we were touching on</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.990" end="00:32:23.800" style="s2">that we are so deep in the damage and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.700" end="00:32:25.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like I was explaining this to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.800" end="00:32:29.530" style="s2">a friend the other day it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.720" end="00:32:31.510" style="s2">like there&#39;s a teacup with a hundred tea</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.530" end="00:32:33.930" style="s2">bags of confusion that have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.510" end="00:32:37.300" style="s2">steeping for a hundred years and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.930" end="00:32:40.450" style="s2">can&#39;t pull all that confusion apart from</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.300" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">itself all that damage and confusion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:49.780" style="s2">really it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to separate it on</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:54.890" style="s2">paper but it won&#39;t be separated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.780" end="00:32:58.460" style="s2">impossible to separate it so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.890" end="00:33:01.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve been struggling more in the past</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.460" end="00:33:06.470" style="s2">few weeks and I have in my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.400" end="00:33:09.350" style="s2">with the political questions and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.470" end="00:33:11.930" style="s2">saying that because I am living in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.350" end="00:33:15.740" style="s2">country where there it&#39;s not my it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.930" end="00:33:20.270" style="s2">my culture okay and I actually cannot</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.740" end="00:33:23.320" style="s2">read the political cues this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.270" end="00:33:29.020" style="s2">very interesting position to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.320" end="00:33:34.490" style="s2">because it&#39;s made me hyper aware of how</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.020" end="00:33:36.350" style="s2">these cues run so deep so what looks at</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">the surface like some sort of political</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.350" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">meme or political positioning or</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:51.170" style="s2">platforming is is much more it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:53.780" style="s2">more submerged than I thought all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.170" end="00:33:57.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s weird that this would come as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.780" end="00:34:02.810" style="s2">surprise to me right but but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.290" end="00:34:08.179" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty significant and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.810" end="00:34:12.649" style="s2">have had to really do is to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.179" end="00:34:16.370" style="s2">relationship between politics and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.649" end="00:34:20.570" style="s2">then also culture and then looking at</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.370" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">those through generations and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.570" end="00:34:28.169" style="s2">coming up with another question</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">all right so the the seduction is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.169" end="00:34:35.820" style="s2">look at the political framing and to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:42.200" style="s2">respond or react to what you see there</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.820" end="00:34:44.820" style="s2">but that framing is is is deep steeped</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.200" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2">you know a lot of other stuff and when</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.820" end="00:34:50.340" style="s2">you start to go around and under and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:53.850" style="s2">into those interdependencies what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.340" end="00:34:59.930" style="s2">come up with is a very different set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:34:59.930" style="s2">questions and responses so</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.710" end="00:35:16.050" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to me in the viral</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:16.050" style="s2">question where it is that this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.200" end="00:35:25.480" style="s2">my health being mine came from</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.710" end="00:35:27.190" style="s2">and how this has been I mean my my mom</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.480" end="00:35:28.660" style="s2">used to talk about how when she was</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.190" end="00:35:34.590" style="s2">raising my big brother</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.660" end="00:35:37.620" style="s2">she was really taught not to coddle him</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.590" end="00:35:40.200" style="s2">which in order to make him be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.620" end="00:35:42.330" style="s2">survive into this culture he needed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.200" end="00:35:45.420" style="s2">be independent he needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.330" end="00:35:48.170" style="s2">emotionally independent let him cry he</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.420" end="00:35:51.180" style="s2">needs to learn how to be independent</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.170" end="00:35:55.310" style="s2">don&#39;t help him with his homework he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.180" end="00:35:55.310" style="s2">got to hit the wall himself</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.410" end="00:36:01.220" style="s2">right he runs out of money don&#39;t bail</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.509" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">him out he&#39;ll just come back for more</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.220" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">right and and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.970" end="00:36:12.430" style="s2">there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:14.050" style="s2">a lot of communication across the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.430" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">generations through the generations</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.050" end="00:36:22.660" style="s2">about how valuable this independence is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:25.210" style="s2">in in you know even my mom who&#39;s 91 she</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.660" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">lives in an apartment building for older</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.210" end="00:36:34.930" style="s2">people because she doesn&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:37.420" style="s2">burden right so so when I start to look</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.930" end="00:36:39.930" style="s2">at what the hell is happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.420" end="00:36:43.390" style="s2">political world around the virus and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.930" end="00:36:45.460" style="s2">then I look at some of those pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.390" end="00:36:48.220" style="s2">it I come up with some very different</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.460" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2">questions which is not should it be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.220" end="00:36:52.420" style="s2">law to wear masks should we be in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.900" end="00:36:56.280" style="s2">lockdown or not lockdown it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.420" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">those are the wrong questions actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.280" end="00:37:03.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a completely different order of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:05.650" style="s2">questions which has to do with how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.130" end="00:37:09.820" style="s2">actually heal this relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.650" end="00:37:14.500" style="s2">begin to pour love and care across</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.820" end="00:37:16.330" style="s2">generations to rekindle to wake up to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.500" end="00:37:18.750" style="s2">bring the blood back to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.330" end="00:37:18.750" style="s2">interdependency</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.050" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">so that it when I go in the store that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.230" end="00:37:27.770" style="s2">person next to me doesn&#39;t see me as just</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:27.770" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.990" end="00:37:33.720" style="s2">another unit that I am actually a person</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:36.359" style="s2">who could be connected to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.720" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">immune deprived or who&#39;s in you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.359" end="00:37:41.460" style="s2">who&#39;s I couldn&#39;t they don&#39;t know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">I&#39;m a healthcare worker maybe I live</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.460" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">with somebody who&#39;s sick</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.790" end="00:37:48.600" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t about hey I&#39;m young I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.190" end="00:37:51.570" style="s2">gonna get this it doesn&#39;t matter I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.600" end="00:37:54.260" style="s2">cool I don&#39;t want to be controlled right</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.570" end="00:37:56.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be controlled either and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.260" end="00:37:58.230" style="s2">so then there&#39;s this other set of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.700" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">political questions that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.230" end="00:38:05.820" style="s2">Authority and militaristic control and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">where technology&#39;s going and and again</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.820" end="00:38:13.290" style="s2">what&#39;s under there how might we ask the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:18.600" style="s2">better question instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.290" end="00:38:23.250" style="s2">responding to that as a as a as a you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.600" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">know kind of sci-fi theme and for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.250" end="00:38:33.230" style="s2">that question has to do more with where</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:33.230" style="s2">is it that technology has no place</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.410" end="00:38:39.560" style="s2">and and who are the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.400" end="00:38:41.450" style="s2">technology world that I can have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.560" end="00:38:44.060" style="s2">conversation with that we can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.450" end="00:38:45.800" style="s2">open that space with I had nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.060" end="00:38:48.120" style="s2">against technology but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.800" end="00:38:53.310" style="s2">places it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.120" end="00:38:55.620" style="s2">and and so it&#39;s great that technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.310" end="00:38:57.430" style="s2">can do anything I don&#39;t want it to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.620" end="00:39:01.140" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.430" end="00:39:04.690" style="s2">so where&#39;s that space so does that help</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.140" end="00:39:07.170" style="s2">so I&#39;m in that political discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.690" end="00:39:07.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:14.729" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m trying not to fall asleep at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.479" end="00:39:17.650" style="s2">the wheel and just get caught in the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.729" end="00:39:23.489" style="s2">impulse to make a direct response to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.650" end="00:39:27.069" style="s2">something that is actually completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.489" end="00:39:29.619" style="s2">brewed in an interdependency of all</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.069" end="00:39:31.690" style="s2">kinds of broken systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.619" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that it&#39;s pointless because</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.690" end="00:39:38.999" style="s2">it&#39;s all broken anyway it&#39;s that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.999" style="s2">order to respond with any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.150" end="00:39:42.210" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.500" end="00:39:45.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.980" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">do you understand no about double binds</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.760" end="00:40:00.030" style="s2">so a double blind is a double bind is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">great theory one of my dad&#39;s there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.030" end="00:40:06.330" style="s2">double blind is is when you get caught</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.250" end="00:40:08.369" style="s2">in two contexts at the same time and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.330" end="00:40:11.720" style="s2">can&#39;t do something and you can&#39;t not do</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.369" end="00:40:15.060" style="s2">something and you can&#39;t talk about it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.720" end="00:40:19.740" style="s2">you might have that experience of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.060" end="00:40:24.750" style="s2">know that partner who tells you you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.740" end="00:40:27.420" style="s2">never tell me that you love me and if in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.750" end="00:40:29.630" style="s2">that moment you say oh what I do love</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.420" end="00:40:29.630" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.609" end="00:40:36.410" style="s2">no you&#39;re just saying that so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.520" end="00:40:38.359" style="s2">really get the credit for saying it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.410" end="00:40:41.809" style="s2">if you don&#39;t say it then they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.359" end="00:40:44.599" style="s2">and if you say yeah but this is a trick</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.809" end="00:40:46.760" style="s2">you&#39;re tricking me then that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.599" end="00:40:52.760" style="s2">this is really not the moment for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.760" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">comment in the same way so much of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.760" end="00:40:58.670" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the political sphere</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">is a double blind we we need to change</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.670" end="00:41:03.410" style="s2">the we need to address the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:05.240" style="s2">issues okay but to address the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.410" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">ecological issues is going to make it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.240" end="00:41:10.700" style="s2">that a lot of people don&#39;t have jobs so</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.349" style="s2">we have to supply jobs but if we supply</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.700" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">jobs and keep the economy going</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.349" end="00:41:22.940" style="s2">it ruins the ecology if we either way</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:25.300" style="s2">you turn we&#39;re in a double bind so one</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.940" end="00:41:30.100" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.300" end="00:41:34.150" style="s2">that you can do in a double bind is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.100" end="00:41:36.430" style="s2">bring in another context so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.150" end="00:41:38.050" style="s2">doing that thing where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.430" end="00:41:40.150" style="s2">complex problem and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.050" end="00:41:42.820" style="s2">simplify remember we&#39;ve got time please</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.150" end="00:41:45.730" style="s2">simplify don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.820" end="00:41:49.240" style="s2">do the opposite thing bring in more</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.730" end="00:41:52.360" style="s2">complexity and then you start to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.240" end="00:41:54.730" style="s2">the overlaps you start to find the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.360" end="00:41:56.650" style="s2">places where the contexts make something</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.730" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">like a Millar a pattern over each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.650" end="00:42:03.850" style="s2">and new unprecedented possibilities come</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:07.480" style="s2">bubbling up so you&#39;re with that partner</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.850" end="00:42:10.450" style="s2">you can&#39;t say you know you can&#39;t say I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.480" end="00:42:14.020" style="s2">do love you and you can&#39;t not say it but</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.450" end="00:42:17.290" style="s2">you might say I grew up in a house where</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.020" end="00:42:19.560" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t a lot of affection okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.290" end="00:42:22.660" style="s2">boom you&#39;re going to another context</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.560" end="00:42:25.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not about it&#39;s not about you or</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.660" end="00:42:28.750" style="s2">them or right you go take it to it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.090" end="00:42:33.670" style="s2">another context and that context begins</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.750" end="00:42:35.460" style="s2">to inform the others and so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.670" end="00:42:39.820" style="s2">I was saying earlier when I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.460" end="00:42:43.590" style="s2">that these things slip out of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.820" end="00:42:43.590" style="s2">context you try to deal with them in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.950" end="00:42:50.350" style="s2">complexity and in living complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.830" end="00:42:54.490" style="s2">that&#39;s always happening I&#39;m that was too</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.350" end="00:42:55.540" style="s2">long but I hope it was helpful thank you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.490" end="00:42:57.850" style="s2">so much that was really</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.540" end="00:43:00.420" style="s2">thought-provoking and thanks for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.850" end="00:43:02.500" style="s2">relationship in place too on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.420" end="00:43:06.550" style="s2">it&#39;s all the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.500" end="00:43:08.610" style="s2">oh yes okay Lorraine would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.550" end="00:43:13.750" style="s2">and meet yourself and ask a question I</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.610" end="00:43:15.670" style="s2">Thank You Nora I&#39;m so over-the-top</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.750" end="00:43:18.370" style="s2">excited to be able to talk with you and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.670" end="00:43:20.410" style="s2">so grateful and honored to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.370" end="00:43:23.260" style="s2">ask this question so I&#39;ve been actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.410" end="00:43:25.870" style="s2">looking a lot at a change in innovation</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.260" end="00:43:28.330" style="s2">in nature and just for a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.870" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">context for you I work as a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.330" end="00:43:33.970" style="s2">designer which feels a bit like an</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:35.980" style="s2">oxymoron but there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.970" end="00:43:38.710" style="s2">challenging thing and so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.980" end="00:43:40.780" style="s2">and change in innovation in nature and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.710" end="00:43:42.220" style="s2">know that caterpillars have cells in</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.780" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">them that are called if imaginal cells</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.220" end="00:43:50.200" style="s2">that are activated by the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:52.300" style="s2">kind of digesting itself literally and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.200" end="00:43:54.700" style="s2">that those cells already have all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.300" end="00:43:58.030" style="s2">potential with those butterfly parts in</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.700" end="00:44:00.790" style="s2">them and I&#39;m wondering like as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:03.850" style="s2">designer should I just step back and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.790" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">try to provoke the change like is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.850" end="00:44:08.470" style="s2">our time for dormancy where we should</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:10.830" style="s2">just wait for what is to come out like</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.470" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">is it already in us and maybe we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.830" end="00:44:18.790" style="s2">so not capable of sitting with it that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:20.770" style="s2">that we want to make it happen this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.790" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">my question like is this just the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.770" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">time and maybe it&#39;ll just emerge you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:30.869" style="s2">know this is a really beautiful question</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:30.869" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.790" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">it it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.050" end="00:44:44.950" style="s2">it&#39;s so tempting right to to dive into</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.000" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">these kind of questions around but</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.950" end="00:44:47.710" style="s2">what&#39;s the action</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:49.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the practicality how what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.710" end="00:44:53.650" style="s2">doing how do we do do do this what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.720" end="00:44:55.770" style="s2">doing and especially when lives are at</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.650" end="00:44:55.770" style="s2">stake</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.850" end="00:45:01.480" style="s2">and ecosystems are at stake it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.169" end="00:45:10.630" style="s2">this question around action um which you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.099" end="00:45:15.459" style="s2">may not think this is what you were</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.630" end="00:45:18.849" style="s2">asking about but it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.459" end="00:45:23.679" style="s2">and one of the things that that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.849" end="00:45:29.699" style="s2">finally have come to just admit is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.679" end="00:45:29.699" style="s2">actually perception is action</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.350" end="00:45:38.300" style="s2">it is and if depending on what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.730" end="00:45:43.310" style="s2">perceived the horizon of potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.300" end="00:45:46.520" style="s2">actions and responses is revealed right</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.310" end="00:45:51.580" style="s2">so in the example of the Monday night</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.520" end="00:45:56.330" style="s2">courses on education that was purely</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.580" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">imaginal cell material right I thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.330" end="00:46:02.200" style="s2">that I was gonna do this thing I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:06.610" style="s2">do this thing and before I knew it it</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.200" end="00:46:11.840" style="s2">was something else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.610" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">and and I tribute that completely that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.840" end="00:46:20.780" style="s2">radical change was something that was in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:23.900" style="s2">my life the whole time and if I had said</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.780" end="00:46:27.140" style="s2">oh the answers within and all I have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.900" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">do is just get still until I see it I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.140" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t think I would have found it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.490" end="00:46:39.960" style="s2">for real so I it wasn&#39;t about being</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.770" end="00:46:44.190" style="s2">still although being still is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.960" end="00:46:47.849" style="s2">it was about a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.190" end="00:46:52.470" style="s2">conditions that allowed that thing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.849" end="00:46:54.589" style="s2">wake up and I didn&#39;t know what those</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.470" end="00:46:57.349" style="s2">conditions were</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.589" end="00:47:06.049" style="s2">I could not have predicted what those</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.349" end="00:47:07.369" style="s2">conditions were but having found myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.049" end="00:47:10.239" style="s2">in the middle of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.369" end="00:47:10.239" style="s2">I didn&#39;t resist</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.770" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">so I could have come in with a script</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.450" end="00:47:17.330" style="s2">and thought this is what I&#39;m gonna do on</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:19.700" style="s2">the first day this is what I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.330" end="00:47:21.560" style="s2">on the second day I got about thirty</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.700" end="00:47:28.900" style="s2">seconds into the first one and we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.560" end="00:47:28.900" style="s2">like we do off off the whole roadmap and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.290" end="00:47:43.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:49.140" style="s2">the the preparation right of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.800" end="00:47:51.630" style="s2">to respond to complexity is is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.140" end="00:47:54.420" style="s2">what it what were what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.630" end="00:47:56.490" style="s2">it&#39;s really about that you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.420" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">was saying this this just watching this</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.490" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">habit of needing to take what I find you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:03.630" style="s2">know so triggering and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:05.819" style="s2">political rhetoric comes up and just</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.630" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">back and you just want to fight it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.819" end="00:48:11.309" style="s2">tear it burn it right and then going</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.309" end="00:48:16.769" style="s2">that&#39;s not the thing that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">pimple on the end of the nose of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.769" end="00:48:23.759" style="s2">thing and and so you know beginning that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:26.459" style="s2">but that&#39;s it that&#39;s a perception that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.759" end="00:48:28.630" style="s2">a perception shift and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.459" end="00:48:33.350" style="s2">action is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.630" end="00:48:37.820" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if that makes sense but</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.350" end="00:48:40.040" style="s2">that&#39;s I definitely don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.820" end="00:48:43.670" style="s2">time for us to be thinking about what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.040" end="00:48:46.520" style="s2">post Corona life going to be like having</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.670" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">said that we absolutely have to consider</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.520" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">what is post Corona life going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:55.120" style="s2">like so what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">those two things one of them is a rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.120" end="00:49:03.290" style="s2">flat set of linear trajectories the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:06.910" style="s2">other one could be a really rich</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.290" end="00:49:06.910" style="s2">dimension of detail</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.560" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">right when I if we were to look around</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.810" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">this zoom space right here and I were to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:23.120" style="s2">ask you how did each of you end up here</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:25.220" style="s2">right there is a bazillion you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.120" end="00:49:27.500" style="s2">someone you sat next to when a bus was</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.220" end="00:49:32.750" style="s2">reading a book when you were in eighth</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.500" end="00:49:34.580" style="s2">grade and then right you met this person</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.750" end="00:49:36.320" style="s2">once and they and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.580" end="00:49:37.910" style="s2">teacher and then you got lost and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.320" end="00:49:40.370" style="s2">had a breakdown and then you got sick</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.910" end="00:49:42.410" style="s2">and you know like there&#39;s what are all</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.370" end="00:49:45.350" style="s2">the stories that are here that brought</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.410" end="00:49:48.440" style="s2">each of you to this room there is no</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.350" end="00:49:53.870" style="s2">flat linear trajectory into that future</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.440" end="00:49:58.730" style="s2">space so it&#39;s about it&#39;s about holding</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.870" end="00:50:01.730" style="s2">em and intending tending the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.730" end="00:50:04.220" style="s2">relationships that grow to become the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.730" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">conditions where those perceptions can</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.220" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.360" end="00:50:15.620" style="s2">but that&#39;s how I would do it that&#39;s my I</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:17.060" style="s2">mean other people have other modalities</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.620" end="00:50:21.740" style="s2">there&#39;s probably room for lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.060" end="00:50:27.550" style="s2">different ways but that&#39;s my more my</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:27.550" style="s2">style thank you so much that was lovely</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.580" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">and Nora so I think that this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.190" end="00:50:38.510" style="s2">beautiful way to kind of finish out Brad</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:39.260" style="s2">would you like to ask your question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.510" end="00:50:44.840" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.260" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">hi either lovely to see you in person I</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.840" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">love your book the smaller arts</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.140" end="00:50:52.610" style="s2">beautiful book and I also enjoy how you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:56.440" style="s2">speak about the different problems you</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.610" end="00:50:59.570" style="s2">have a way of speaking in a in a rich</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.440" end="00:51:01.130" style="s2">contextual circular but with some sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.570" end="00:51:04.250" style="s2">of meaning being transmitted it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:05.870" style="s2">blocked so I can see why someone reads a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.250" end="00:51:07.940" style="s2">transcript of this conversation they</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.870" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">would lose out on what is the essence</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.940" end="00:51:13.190" style="s2">that&#39;s being conveyed it brings me to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:15.400" style="s2">the point that how do we decide what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.190" end="00:51:18.200" style="s2">the right question you ask and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.400" end="00:51:19.610" style="s2">Illustrated some of that in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.200" end="00:51:21.790" style="s2">questions that was asked to you where</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.610" end="00:51:24.200" style="s2">you went through that process of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.790" end="00:51:25.790" style="s2">switching between and saying is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.200" end="00:51:28.070" style="s2">even the right question you consider and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.790" end="00:51:28.460" style="s2">then you did some some let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.070" end="00:51:32.510" style="s2">magic</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.460" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">I would love to listen to your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.510" end="00:51:37.400" style="s2">process around what are the principles</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:40.100" style="s2">that help you reframe your question what</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.400" end="00:51:42.050" style="s2">is the right question because like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.100" end="00:51:45.700" style="s2">said if it&#39;s a wrong question we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.050" end="00:51:48.470" style="s2">we&#39;re just stuck in the wrong action</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.700" end="00:51:52.550" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s this great Einstein quote</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.450" end="00:53:52.980" style="s2">interested in is the way in which these</p>
