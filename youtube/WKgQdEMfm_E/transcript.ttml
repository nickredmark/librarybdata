<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">personal level</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">changed in the way that suddenly made my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">work more relevant apparently and so are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">more busy and in that way I&#39;m also busy</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">because I&#39;m I decided in order to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">and help out I would start live</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">streaming a meditation course over a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">10-week period which seems to be helping</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">people and then I&#39;m continues to like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">lot of my work writing and researching</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">Kristin Christmas the Pietro and I are</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">writing multiple things we got chapters</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">coming out in books and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s been good the I mean it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:13.600" style="s2">hard because I don&#39;t live with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:15.490" style="s2">partner so we decided if</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.600" end="00:02:17.650" style="s2">we got separated by lockdown that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.490" end="00:02:19.630" style="s2">would stay with my son and my apartment</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.650" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">and she&#39;d stay with her daughter in her</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.630" end="00:02:25.900" style="s2">house so I I don&#39;t get to see her</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">physically and it&#39;s been quite a quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.900" end="00:02:30.850" style="s2">while you know well of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:33.730" style="s2">facetiming a lot but that&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.850" end="00:02:37.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of a challenge yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.730" end="00:02:39.970" style="s2">sounds hard it is hard but in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.630" end="00:02:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s been good too I used to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.970" end="00:02:44.170" style="s2">how people say you want to see how a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.310" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">relationships going or if it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.170" end="00:02:47.380" style="s2">be a good one you know paint a house or</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:48.760" style="s2">go on a trip but it looks like go</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.380" end="00:02:52.630" style="s2">through a pandemic together is a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.760" end="00:02:54.760" style="s2">good test too because we&#39;re we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.630" end="00:02:57.610" style="s2">discovering I mean I always knew this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.760" end="00:02:59.740" style="s2">but it&#39;s been made now very apparent to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.610" end="00:03:02.290" style="s2">me you there&#39;s a real significant depth</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.740" end="00:03:05.260" style="s2">to our relationship and so of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.290" end="00:03:08.410" style="s2">where we&#39;re exploring and developing</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.260" end="00:03:10.420" style="s2">that quite significantly so that death</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.410" end="00:03:12.940" style="s2">you know I mean of course I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.420" end="00:03:14.320" style="s2">her so that&#39;s been a challenge but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.940" end="00:03:16.420" style="s2">mean compared to a lot of other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.320" end="00:03:18.370" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s relatively minor my son</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.420" end="00:03:20.770" style="s2">for example he&#39;s like he was all</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.370" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">completely out of work was so it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.770" end="00:03:24.520" style="s2">he&#39;s living with me so he&#39;s safe and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">everything I mean I&#39;m in a privileged</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.520" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">position that way I mean because I I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">able to move almost all the teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:35.380" style="s2">research I do online you know the not</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">that impacted that way I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.380" end="00:03:39.100" style="s2">other people are facing much greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:42.580" style="s2">hardships a much greater risk the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.100" end="00:03:44.830" style="s2">significant thing is it&#39;s my it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.580" end="00:03:46.450" style="s2">causing my health to suffer partially</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.830" end="00:03:48.670" style="s2">it&#39;s also the weather here if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.450" end="00:03:50.590" style="s2">remember in Canada April is a very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.670" end="00:03:53.140" style="s2">the cruelest a month as TS Eliot said</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.590" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">right in the weather is very volatile so</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.140" end="00:03:57.730" style="s2">my ear has been very bad no doubt both</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">the weather and all the back the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.730" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">background stress from the pandemic so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:04.020" style="s2">that&#39;s about where I&#39;m sitting how are</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">you guys all doing where are you guys</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.020" end="00:04:10.180" style="s2">we&#39;re all in Mexico what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">you&#39;re all in Mexico yeah we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:13.630" style="s2">well like we&#39;re trying to take on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:17.620" style="s2">and like produce a lot of extra content</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.630" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">during the coronavirus yeah good bunch</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.620" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">of other like personal projects and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:25.270" style="s2">other projects were working on so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">it&#39;s weird it&#39;s hard it&#39;s good it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.270" end="00:04:31.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really tense there</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:33.800" style="s2">no time for rest but also we&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.160" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">lucky and have a good place to be so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.800" end="00:04:40.790" style="s2">good to hear you guys are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:43.010" style="s2">safe though is that yeah yeah we&#39;re safe</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.790" end="00:04:44.570" style="s2">it&#39;s been interesting like I just moved</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.010" end="00:04:47.480" style="s2">to Mexico like a few weeks before this</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">happened so it&#39;s few transitions at once</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.480" end="00:04:52.040" style="s2">but yeah like Sakata said we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:54.110" style="s2">lucky good yeah speaking of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.040" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">which we&#39;re gonna be speaking about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.110" end="00:04:58.520" style="s2">whole time we were all kind of curious</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">in in some of your interviews that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.520" end="00:05:01.639" style="s2">you&#39;ve done recently you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:03.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe this will be the only</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.639" end="00:05:06.050" style="s2">pandemic so they&#39;re just wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.710" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">you speak to that I&#39;m just making a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">probabilistic causal argument and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">argument goes like this there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">causal factors that probably led to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">they have to do with things like melting</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.150" end="00:05:18.919" style="s2">the permafrost and cutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">rainforests and disturbing ocean</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.919" end="00:05:27.229" style="s2">currents and air currents globalization</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">of trade etc and those factors aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.229" end="00:05:32.840" style="s2">going away they&#39;re not going away</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.500" end="00:05:35.660" style="s2">and if anything they will probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.840" end="00:05:38.870" style="s2">continue to accelerate and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.660" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">it&#39;s highly likely I mean the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.870" end="00:05:44.210" style="s2">community has been has been predicting a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">pandemic for quite at some time and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.210" end="00:05:48.919" style="s2">the fact that the prediction has come</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:52.070" style="s2">true provides empirical confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.919" end="00:05:54.860" style="s2">that those factors do lead to pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.070" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">and the fact that those factors will</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.860" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2">continue on means it&#39;s highly probable</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:02.900" style="s2">that there will be other pandemics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:03.889" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I mean one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.900" end="00:06:05.570" style="s2">been thinking about is like with</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.889" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">antibiotic resistance like stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.570" end="00:06:09.470" style="s2">this might happen more on a bacterial</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">level sure I think it&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.470" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">more the antibiotic resistance is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:15.139" style="s2">happen but I think we&#39;re also gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">just a lot more viral stuff happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.139" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">because we&#39;re just done walking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">stuff and we&#39;re just doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:23.660" style="s2">ecosystems and we&#39;re causing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:25.010" style="s2">migration of species it&#39;s you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.660" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2">we&#39;re just interacting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.010" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">at a much more intense level to frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.700" end="00:06:32.360" style="s2">this as let&#39;s just enjoy this we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:34.100" style="s2">over this and then everything will go</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.360" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">back to normal for centuries and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.100" end="00:06:40.530" style="s2">centuries I think is I think that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:43.920" style="s2">a rational framing one of the concerns I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.530" end="00:06:45.690" style="s2">is I multiply have multiple concerns</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.920" end="00:06:47.130" style="s2">about that we&#39;ll get into them the ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.690" end="00:06:50.040" style="s2">that I&#39;m sort of concerned that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.130" end="00:06:52.950" style="s2">socio-economic level is we can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.040" end="00:06:54.510" style="s2">doing this debt intensification every</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.950" end="00:06:57.930" style="s2">time we get a pen down we got to come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.510" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">with a way of coordinating the financial</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.930" end="00:07:03.450" style="s2">aspects of the economy in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.920" style="s2">resilient fashion sorry I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.450" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">expert on that I can&#39;t comment on all I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.920" end="00:07:08.430" style="s2">can see is that this pattern can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:10.650" style="s2">continue so I don&#39;t know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.430" end="00:07:12.120" style="s2">for us my sin is that what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.650" end="00:07:14.690" style="s2">is people are considering things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.120" end="00:07:16.980" style="s2">ubi that were just beyond the pale</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.690" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">twenty three months ago right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.980" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">like oh wait maybe we need to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:23.190" style="s2">about this and stuff like that right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">you mentioned just increasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.190" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">globalization and cutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:30.210" style="s2">rainforests and stuff do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.470" style="s2">maybe maybe these these factors that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.210" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">these causal factors that lets the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.470" end="00:07:35.940" style="s2">pandemic could have been avoided somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.290" style="s2">or do you see it more as like inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.940" end="00:07:39.060" style="s2">that that that we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.290" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">increasing pandemics and then and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.060" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">the way the way back to normalcy is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">going to be that we sort of we weather</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:47.370" style="s2">the storm in some way and become</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:49.290" style="s2">stronger as a result so that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.370" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">good question I think what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.290" end="00:07:58.140" style="s2">about that is that given in our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:07:59.970" style="s2">framing in which the only unchallenged</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.140" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">normative Authority for us was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.970" end="00:08:04.890" style="s2">market and this is an argument to Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:07.229" style="s2">björkman made really really well I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.890" end="00:08:10.919" style="s2">in his work and now how we got into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.229" end="00:08:15.240" style="s2">medic crisis I think as long as we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.919" end="00:08:20.970" style="s2">a homogenous monolithic normativity like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.240" end="00:08:24.650" style="s2">that that is in a sense abstracted from</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.970" end="00:08:28.200" style="s2">the environment I think that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.650" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">pandemics are going to be inevitable if</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.200" end="00:08:34.530" style="s2">we were to make a change in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:37.740" style="s2">change in our cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.530" end="00:08:41.640" style="s2">and we had normativity x&#39; other than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.740" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">market and we had a notion of political</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.640" end="00:08:47.820" style="s2">economic organization that was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:50.040" style="s2">embedded in culture and history and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.820" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">especially environment then it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.040" end="00:08:53.180" style="s2">possible we could make the requisite</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:55.010" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">to reduce or at least ameliorate those</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.010" end="00:09:01.100" style="s2">factors significantly so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">reduce the probability of pandemics okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.100" end="00:09:07.640" style="s2">so we&#39;re kind of tying pandemics with</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:09.230" style="s2">capitalism not just I mean not in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.640" end="00:09:13.399" style="s2">capitalism in open up in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.230" end="00:09:15.050" style="s2">way the idea that after the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.399" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">critique what happens is the market</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.050" end="00:09:19.700" style="s2">survives as the default of normativity</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:22.790" style="s2">than the default Authority so and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.700" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">what happens to that is that everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.790" end="00:09:27.050" style="s2">else gets bent into this market the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:29.480" style="s2">market is basically our God right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.050" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">the it&#39;s the hyper object that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.480" end="00:09:34.040" style="s2">omnipresent right and regulates</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:36.950" style="s2">everything about how we think and see an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.040" end="00:09:38.990" style="s2">active feel and I don&#39;t know that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.950" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">inevitable feature of capitalism per se</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.990" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">but it is it is definitely where we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:46.190" style="s2">gotten to historically I mean there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:48.110" style="s2">a time when we had you know we had the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.190" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">state as separate from the market and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.110" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">the church as separate from the state on</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:53.630" style="s2">the market and they were playing off</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">against each other and that was perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:58.850" style="s2">a better condition for us but we we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:00.589" style="s2">especially over the last you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.850" end="00:10:02.779" style="s2">basically since Thatcher and Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.589" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided no no let&#39;s let&#39;s destroy</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.779" end="00:10:08.570" style="s2">everything that in any way resists the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:10.490" style="s2">markets freedom of action because that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.570" end="00:10:12.200" style="s2">will somehow bring utopia and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.490" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">that vision is what I&#39;m criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.200" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2">harshly I&#39;m not right and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">that is what we need to take into</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:21.320" style="s2">consideration and I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">happening is people are realizing wait</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.320" end="00:10:26.450" style="s2">a lot of that service that I did for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">market it really did not up to anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.450" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">I&#39;m now here I&#39;m alone in my home and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">what did all that what was all that for</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:37.910" style="s2">and what&#39;s the market doing for me now</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">in fact the market doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.910" end="00:10:43.520" style="s2">helping this problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:48.260" style="s2">it seems to be floundering around like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.520" end="00:10:50.390" style="s2">decapitated child right and it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.260" end="00:10:53.510" style="s2">and so what do we do well we tried</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.390" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">gather together the remaining machinery</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.510" end="00:10:58.130" style="s2">of culture and what&#39;s left of the state</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.709" style="s2">and we try oh can we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.130" end="00:11:02.779" style="s2">solution yeah that&#39;s right and so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.709" end="00:11:04.860" style="s2">think we&#39;re maybe we&#39;re coming to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.779" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">point where we&#39;re realizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:11.070" style="s2">the market isn&#39;t a god and we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:13.020" style="s2">treat it that way now that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.070" end="00:11:16.290" style="s2">me a communist and it doesn&#39;t make me an</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.020" end="00:11:18.060" style="s2">anarchist infected I think try because</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.290" end="00:11:20.010" style="s2">all of those are still all pitching</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.060" end="00:11:22.140" style="s2">around just different either completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.010" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">worshipping or completely demonizing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.140" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">market and that is to foreground it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.660" style="s2">exactly the way I want to call into</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:30.390" style="s2">question I want to say we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.660" end="00:11:31.710" style="s2">rethink about we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.390" end="00:11:33.960" style="s2">normativity &#39;s of culture and history</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.710" end="00:11:35.220" style="s2">that&#39;s what tradition used to mean and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.960" end="00:11:37.020" style="s2">we used to have normativity &#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.220" end="00:11:39.030" style="s2">spirituality that&#39;s what religion met</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.020" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">and meaning making and we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.030" end="00:11:43.620" style="s2">normativity &#39;s around you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:46.370" style="s2">reflection and the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.620" end="00:11:48.630" style="s2">there were cultures you know in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.370" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">wisdom schools were flourishing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.630" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">working we were given high you know high</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:55.650" style="s2">value within that culture and cultures</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:59.340" style="s2">other than our own our culture is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.650" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">any kind of necessity there we have many</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.340" end="00:12:05.820" style="s2">examples of alternatives and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:07.320" style="s2">hoping that when people or people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.820" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">now in the place where they can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.320" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">consider those alternatives more</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:12.750" style="s2">seriously interesting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.580" style="s2">definitely requiring us to rethink how</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.750" end="00:12:17.010" style="s2">we do things for sure yeah well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.580" end="00:12:22.110" style="s2">not going back I mean the a great danger</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.010" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">here is a kind of naive nostalgia where</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.110" end="00:12:25.740" style="s2">everybody&#39;s holding their breath until</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">we get back to where the way it used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.740" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">be it&#39;s not going back it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">back the way it didn&#39;t go back after the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:32.370" style="s2">Black Plague it&#39;s not going back the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t go back after the Great</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.370" end="00:12:37.170" style="s2">Depression in World War two it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.860" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">back it&#39;s not going back okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:40.740" style="s2">think this this event is sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:42.060" style="s2">on the same level as one of those on</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.740" end="00:12:43.590" style="s2">like the Great Depression or the Black</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.060" end="00:12:46.670" style="s2">Plague or something like that well what</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.590" end="00:12:50.700" style="s2">was the last event that was worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.670" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">yeah I guess I guess so yeah in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.700" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">degree it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:56.520" style="s2">gotten that bad yet but I guess it could</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">it could get there and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.520" end="00:13:00.930" style="s2">pretty scary</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:02.850" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re projecting deaths in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.930" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">United States that will be greater than</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.850" end="00:13:06.630" style="s2">the deaths for World War one and might</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:08.340" style="s2">approach the deaths the Americans</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.630" end="00:13:10.860" style="s2">suffered in World War two so could even</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.340" end="00:13:13.020" style="s2">get there possibly a degree oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.860" end="00:13:14.490" style="s2">yeah this may be a good segue onto onto</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.020" end="00:13:17.790" style="s2">mythology do you want to take a coup d</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.490" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">well yeah one of the things you&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.790" end="00:13:19.520" style="s2">of laid the ground</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.540" style="s2">right there one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.520" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned is that many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.540" end="00:13:27.740" style="s2">right now that you&#39;ve spoken with seem</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.840" style="s2">to be experiencing like more meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.740" end="00:13:32.990" style="s2">during this time as opposed to like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.840" end="00:13:34.850" style="s2">kind of sense of not knowing what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:37.190" style="s2">purpose and meaning is in life and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.850" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">one potential explanation of many that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.190" end="00:13:42.820" style="s2">you brought up for that was that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:45.980" style="s2">coronavirus crisis harkens back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">almost mythological times or even</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.980" end="00:13:50.390" style="s2">biblical times or like that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.290" end="00:13:54.470" style="s2">a context might be coming up in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.390" end="00:13:55.490" style="s2">minds and making us feel like we we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.470" end="00:13:57.400" style="s2">more meaning in our lives right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.490" end="00:13:59.870" style="s2">could you expand on that connection yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.400" end="00:14:01.580" style="s2">thanks Katie so let me let me try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.870" end="00:14:03.020" style="s2">let&#39;s unpack because I&#39;ve been putting a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.580" end="00:14:04.670" style="s2">lot of thought and discussion into this</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.020" end="00:14:06.020" style="s2">over the last couple of weeks with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.670" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">of people in waterful I just did a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.020" end="00:14:10.760" style="s2">really had a really great discussion</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">with David fuller from rebel wisdom on</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.760" end="00:14:14.420" style="s2">just all this sort of stuff because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.330" style="s2">doing a thing on sort of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.420" end="00:14:19.339" style="s2">theories around kovat so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.330" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">do is front because I went on pack the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.339" end="00:14:24.050" style="s2">phenomenology because I think it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:26.120" style="s2">complex so people I think are actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.050" end="00:14:26.810" style="s2">having this very complex relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:29.540" style="s2">meaning right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.810" end="00:14:31.400" style="s2">part of it is what you said Katie but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.540" end="00:14:34.730" style="s2">want to try to expand it out because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.400" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">think that you know I I&#39;m continually</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.730" end="00:14:38.270" style="s2">sort of revising how I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:39.290" style="s2">this and how I&#39;m approaching it and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.270" end="00:14:41.930" style="s2">definitely want to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.290" end="00:14:44.330" style="s2">mythopoetic and biblical aspects of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.930" end="00:14:46.130" style="s2">but so as I&#39;ve been talking to more</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.330" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">people and more discussion and getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.130" end="00:14:50.810" style="s2">what news I can and the news is all</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:52.790" style="s2">weirdly you know one of the my</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.810" end="00:14:55.670" style="s2">criticisms as the news keeps just sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.790" end="00:14:58.430" style="s2">of focusing on you know the biological</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.670" end="00:14:59.750" style="s2">and economic aspects and what we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.430" end="00:15:01.160" style="s2">paying attention to is we&#39;re building up</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.750" end="00:15:04.100" style="s2">sort of a mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.160" end="00:15:07.550" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be quite significant and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.100" end="00:15:09.500" style="s2">we and and and we need to be we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.550" end="00:15:12.110" style="s2">start thinking about that and putting in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.500" end="00:15:15.140" style="s2">machinery to try and ameliorate that as</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.110" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">soon as we can why well think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.140" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">so you know in some of the work I did</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.690" style="s2">with Chris and and Chris and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">working a lot on this together Chris</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.690" end="00:15:25.640" style="s2">master Pietro we&#39;re going through Dom</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:27.560" style="s2">aside and we talked about how the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.640" end="00:15:28.220" style="s2">meeting crisis in the book where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.560" end="00:15:31.130" style="s2">wrote with fellow</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.220" end="00:15:32.390" style="s2">i&#39;ma Civic right and how we also had</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.130" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">something like this in the Hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.390" end="00:15:37.160" style="s2">. ama site is losing a sense of home and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.670" end="00:15:39.170" style="s2">so a lot of people are losing a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.160" end="00:15:42.530" style="s2">home or at least they&#39;re experiencing an</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.170" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">incredible contraction in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.530" end="00:15:46.220" style="s2">home and where they feel safe and where</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">they feel at home they don&#39;t feel at</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.220" end="00:15:50.900" style="s2">home going outside it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:53.180" style="s2">agoraphobic a lot of people now and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.900" end="00:15:55.330" style="s2">know they&#39;re losing a lot of their other</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.180" end="00:15:57.650" style="s2">homes people can&#39;t go to their workplace</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.330" end="00:16:00.080" style="s2">which is a significant contributor to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.650" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">people&#39;s identity in a lot of way so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.080" end="00:16:05.180" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a significant dama side</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:07.220" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.180" end="00:16:09.470" style="s2">the world the options in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.220" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">suddenly collapsing and who and what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.470" end="00:16:14.630" style="s2">can be is narrowing so you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:17.180" style="s2">that happening connections a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.630" end="00:16:18.530" style="s2">connections are being lost so something</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.180" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">that people aren&#39;t talking about yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.530" end="00:16:21.890" style="s2">publicly although it&#39;s coming up in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">lot of these discussions I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.890" end="00:16:24.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:26.870" style="s2">fracturing right now a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.770" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">relationships are fractured and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.870" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">relationships are being strained I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve mentioned that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.220" end="00:16:34.760" style="s2">strain of it since that I think it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.290" style="s2">risk but you know there&#39;s a strain on</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.760" end="00:16:38.030" style="s2">the relationship I have with my partner</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.290" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">and because we can&#39;t physically live</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.030" end="00:16:41.900" style="s2">with each other right now all right</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">and so you&#39;re getting a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.900" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">connection and then this is again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:49.970" style="s2">seeing this a lot and a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:52.190" style="s2">groups of people I&#39;m talking to and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.970" end="00:16:54.260" style="s2">not again getting into sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.190" end="00:16:56.690" style="s2">official mainstream media&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.260" end="00:16:58.460" style="s2">catching the eye but many people and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.690" end="00:17:00.440" style="s2">think Katy was even sort of alluding to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.460" end="00:17:02.450" style="s2">this many people are describing their</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.440" end="00:17:04.339" style="s2">sense of the connectedness to the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.450" end="00:17:06.560" style="s2">being fundamentally changed so an</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.339" end="00:17:09.020" style="s2">adjective that I&#39;m hearing a lot to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.560" end="00:17:12.380" style="s2">and get this complex shift is surreal</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.020" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">everything feels surreal and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.380" end="00:17:17.270" style="s2">you guys are known eleda yes that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">great word right and so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.270" end="00:17:21.770" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s again and notice</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.020" style="s2">that that has mental health dangers</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.770" end="00:17:25.910" style="s2">associated with it right if you people</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.020" end="00:17:27.410" style="s2">put people in a long-term environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.910" end="00:17:29.780" style="s2">where they&#39;re constantly feeling surreal</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.410" end="00:17:31.670" style="s2">they&#39;re losing options the world is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.780" end="00:17:33.800" style="s2">narrowing they&#39;re losing a sense of home</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.670" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">they&#39;re losing their relationships this</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.800" end="00:17:39.020" style="s2">is really really dilatory us now so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:42.140" style="s2">that&#39;s all happening now on the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.020" end="00:17:44.990" style="s2">hand there are there are people who get</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.140" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">sort of a salience intensity other the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.990" end="00:17:48.200" style="s2">virus it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:50.300" style="s2">salient thing that it&#39;s very intense and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.200" end="00:17:54.170" style="s2">it keeps their attention and for right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.300" end="00:17:56.600" style="s2">now as long as that the novelty is is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.170" end="00:17:58.970" style="s2">going that will give them a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.600" end="00:18:01.010" style="s2">sort of meaning the thing we have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:03.110" style="s2">remember about that is we&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.010" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">sprint were in a marathon and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.110" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">gonna fade and then people are on their</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.800" style="s2">they have to go through the net then</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">there&#39;s another aspect to it which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.800" end="00:18:20.060" style="s2">people people are falling back on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:23.560" style="s2">meaning making machinery because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.060" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">what&#39;s left it&#39;s what&#39;s left right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.560" end="00:18:28.370" style="s2">they&#39;re realizing that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">where most of the mattering comes from</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.370" end="00:18:33.710" style="s2">is the meaning making this journey and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:35.510" style="s2">so they&#39;re because of that they might be</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.710" end="00:18:37.070" style="s2">experiencing an intensification of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.510" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">meaning precisely because they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.070" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">much more invested in the meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:43.250" style="s2">machinery but there&#39;s also an attendant</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:47.180" style="s2">danger there notice how I keep sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.250" end="00:18:48.710" style="s2">giving and taking because the attendant</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.180" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">danger there is that people are being</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.710" end="00:18:55.670" style="s2">thrown back onto their subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.150" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">right and that meaning making machinery</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.670" end="00:19:00.620" style="s2">and they&#39;re finding that their culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:02.810" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really afforded them a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.620" end="00:19:05.780" style="s2">depth and resources and resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.810" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">around all of that machinery so so when</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.780" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">you talk about the meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">machinery are you referring to like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:12.350" style="s2">societal sort of collective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:14.870" style="s2">making or are you talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.350" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">individual meaning making well both and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.870" end="00:19:19.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the point there inseparably bound</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">together okay I see right even let let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:22.970" style="s2">just you the prosaic example you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:24.650" style="s2">think on your own you&#39;re gonna think in</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.970" end="00:19:28.610" style="s2">English but you didn&#39;t come up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.650" end="00:19:30.860" style="s2">English you didn&#39;t make it okay English</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.610" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">is not part really of your subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.860" end="00:19:35.240" style="s2">although you treat it as if it is right</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:36.830" style="s2">this goes to deeper points that pick and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.240" end="00:19:38.090" style="s2">shine and Heidegger made about language</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.830" end="00:19:39.890" style="s2">I&#39;m just using sort of a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.090" end="00:19:42.920" style="s2">version of their argument to point out</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.890" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">something right a sensor so the and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.920" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">talking about what the meaning and life</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:48.110" style="s2">literature shows you know I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.940" style="s2">a paper right now is with some</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.110" end="00:19:51.680" style="s2">colleagues and arrays of mine you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.940" end="00:19:53.540" style="s2">the things that really make meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.680" end="00:19:56.590" style="s2">life or you know mattering to other</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.540" end="00:19:58.550" style="s2">people you know being a sense of caring</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.590" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">for others being cared for others</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.550" end="00:20:01.909" style="s2">connecting to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2">of to others to reality all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.909" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">connection machinery the connection and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:08.360" style="s2">coherence machinery so so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">when you&#39;re saying people are falling</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.360" end="00:20:14.179" style="s2">back on meaning making machinery right</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:15.500" style="s2">so so is that is that increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.179" end="00:20:18.049" style="s2">pressure on the meaning making machinery</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.500" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">and perhaps exposing the the cracks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.049" end="00:20:23.110" style="s2">so I think what I&#39;m saying is remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.600" end="00:20:25.970" style="s2">one night we talked and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.110" end="00:20:28.039" style="s2">how we last time where I was with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.970" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">guys how we we did this to romantic</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.039" end="00:20:31.250" style="s2">relationships because romantic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:33.140" style="s2">relationships they involve the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.250" end="00:20:35.030" style="s2">attachments to machinery and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.140" end="00:20:36.770" style="s2">connection machinery and mattering to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.030" end="00:20:38.539" style="s2">someone other than yourself and caring</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.770" end="00:20:40.940" style="s2">of them beyond your egocentric concerns</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.539" end="00:20:42.350" style="s2">we then try to load everything into our</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.940" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">romantic relationships and we put a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.350" end="00:20:47.990" style="s2">tremendous burden on it so we intensify</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.730" style="s2">their value or their so important but we</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.990" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">also put them on a terrific strain and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.730" end="00:20:54.679" style="s2">think what we&#39;re doing is because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:58.669" style="s2">have not culturally pursued a deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.679" end="00:21:00.110" style="s2">education for for people into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.669" end="00:21:02.929" style="s2">meaning making machinery and its</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.110" end="00:21:04.309" style="s2">attendant powers and parallels we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.929" end="00:21:06.049" style="s2">doing something very similar to what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.309" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">did with our romantic relationships</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.049" end="00:21:12.169" style="s2">we&#39;re putting a terrific strain on it</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:14.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to be telling now I</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.169" end="00:21:16.549" style="s2">think it&#39;s also the fact so you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.330" end="00:21:19.309" style="s2">what Witten&#39;s work for example 2008</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.549" end="00:21:22.429" style="s2">right when people sense a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.309" end="00:21:25.640" style="s2">control they immediately start looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.429" end="00:21:28.309" style="s2">for patterns so the brain the brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.640" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">solution - and by the way she was able</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.309" end="00:21:32.750" style="s2">ish empirically show this is distinct</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">from threat so it&#39;s not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.750" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">under threat that&#39;s doing this it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">the loss of control so if you&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:39.260" style="s2">threat and you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:42.169" style="s2">losing control none of what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.260" end="00:21:44.510" style="s2">talk about happens but if you received</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.169" end="00:21:46.520" style="s2">loss of control then what the brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.510" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">starts immediately doing is looking for</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.520" end="00:21:50.150" style="s2">patterns and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">meaning-making thing to do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.150" end="00:21:54.140" style="s2">intelligibility but what our work shows</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.100" end="00:21:56.840" style="s2">really powerfully this is what she was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.140" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">specifically looking for is you are much</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">more likely to to perceive illusory</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">patterns to pick on much tighter that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t really there and especially to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:12.530" style="s2">believe in conspiracy theories because</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">these are the youth you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.530" end="00:22:17.570" style="s2">pattern is a narrative pattern a story</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.900" end="00:22:23.390" style="s2">that makes sense of this and gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.570" end="00:22:25.430" style="s2">role and something you can do and so so</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.390" end="00:22:27.560" style="s2">people will be experiencing again a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.430" end="00:22:29.540" style="s2">surge of meaning because they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.560" end="00:22:32.120" style="s2">all this meaning making but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.540" end="00:22:34.040" style="s2">maladaptive right they&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.120" end="00:22:35.690" style="s2">Machine right there do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.040" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2">it the right hemisphere what did it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.690" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">evolve for it evolved for when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:41.420" style="s2">under predation right the left</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:43.790" style="s2">hemisphere is you know you know find</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.580" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">is no no what do you do when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.830" end="00:22:53.180" style="s2">predator coming well you don&#39;t look for</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:54.860" style="s2">the details you don&#39;t go I&#39;m not certain</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.860" end="00:23:00.440" style="s2">don&#39;t care you go for the gestalt and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.380" end="00:23:02.840" style="s2">you tolerate ambiguity and you look for</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.440" end="00:23:06.130" style="s2">an you grab for patterns right that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.840" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">allows you to interact and intervene</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.130" end="00:23:10.310" style="s2">interesting so so the so the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:11.630" style="s2">hemisphere is sort of activating when we</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.310" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">lose control sitters the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.630" end="00:23:16.670" style="s2">hemisphere is activating very much and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">this is the hemisphere that is much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.670" end="00:23:21.890" style="s2">oriented towards sort of mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:22.550" style="s2">ways of thinking mythopoetic ways of</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.550" end="00:23:26.870" style="s2">this is adaptive your your your agency</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.460" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">detecting machinery that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.870" end="00:23:31.550" style="s2">looking for agency it&#39;s adaptive because</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:33.650" style="s2">it misfires a lot you owe that you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.550" end="00:23:35.780" style="s2">you see faces in the clouds and faces in</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.650" end="00:23:38.300" style="s2">the trees and right and it misfires a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.780" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">lot but it doesn&#39;t cost you much if if</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.380" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">or you&#39;re going to become somebody&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:53.750" style="s2">gonna miss an ally so all of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:56.330" style="s2">adaptive machinery it&#39;s kicking in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.750" end="00:23:58.520" style="s2">it&#39;s finding patterns and and that feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.330" end="00:24:00.800" style="s2">like a lot of meaning being made because</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.520" end="00:24:03.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the adaptive machinery that gives</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.970" end="00:25:56.500" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly so crispy and Berrigan</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:25:58.300" style="s2">actually argue that in their behavioral</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.500" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">there are people who are very future lis</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.180" end="00:26:15.100" style="s2">oriented that probably have a left</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">hemispheric dominance right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.100" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">featuring oriented they they need to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.070" style="s2">things very algorithmically they work</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:22.510" style="s2">under standards of certainty right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.070" end="00:26:24.010" style="s2">you can see why that helps to explain a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.510" end="00:26:25.930" style="s2">lot of features of some of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.010" end="00:26:27.400" style="s2">subpopulations of autism that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.930" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">think they chose that term and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.400" end="00:26:32.350" style="s2">psychotic people are the opposite right</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:34.890" style="s2">they tend to find connections and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.350" end="00:26:37.690" style="s2">patterns they&#39;re super good salty</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.890" end="00:26:38.660" style="s2">where there are none and what we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.690" end="00:26:42.860" style="s2">is we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.660" end="00:26:44.750" style="s2">with what we need right are the are you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.860" end="00:26:48.650" style="s2">know the combination of the training of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.750" end="00:26:51.620" style="s2">our aesthetic sensibility so we can and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.650" end="00:26:53.480" style="s2">and you know sort of what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.620" end="00:26:55.550" style="s2">like it&#39;s the artists age</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.480" end="00:26:58.910" style="s2">so the mythopoetic stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.550" end="00:27:01.280" style="s2">appropriately being shaped in concert</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.910" end="00:27:04.610" style="s2">with you know how that the training of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.280" end="00:27:07.730" style="s2">wisdom we&#39;ve lost that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.610" end="00:27:10.040" style="s2">that which is unfortunate for us now</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.730" end="00:27:12.380" style="s2">such a thing is possible you know I hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.040" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">out you know Socrates and the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.380" end="00:27:16.310" style="s2">dialogues of chronic dialogues you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:18.430" style="s2">separate the argumentation from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.310" end="00:27:20.660" style="s2">artistry and you&#39;re not just presenting</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.430" end="00:27:22.550" style="s2">alternative arguments you&#39;re presenting</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:25.370" style="s2">alternative ways of life ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.550" end="00:27:27.920" style="s2">and let&#39;s remember Socrates is doing his</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.370" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">shtick when happens it&#39;s literally under</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.920" end="00:27:32.450" style="s2">siege by Sparta there has literally been</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:34.400" style="s2">a plague in Athens and it has literally</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.450" end="00:27:37.310" style="s2">killed the leadership of Pericles and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.400" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">yet he&#39;s doing all of that right there</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.310" end="00:27:41.390" style="s2">and then so I&#39;m not talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:43.340" style="s2">utopic fantasy I&#39;m talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.390" end="00:27:45.530" style="s2">reality that actually happened but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.340" end="00:27:48.920" style="s2">are not doing it we don&#39;t have it now oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.530" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">wow yeah go ahead are you maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.920" end="00:27:52.580" style="s2">move things into like how we hope things</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.590" style="s2">can go or how things can maybe go in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.580" end="00:27:56.390" style="s2">more positive way with this artists age</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.590" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">kind of figure like you mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.390" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">your conversation with Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:00.770" style="s2">mastropiero and Andrew Sweeney about how</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:02.900" style="s2">you think that myth is going to come to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.770" end="00:28:04.130" style="s2">the fore during these times yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.900" end="00:28:05.270" style="s2">what do you think that&#39;s gonna look like</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.130" end="00:28:09.670" style="s2">and in particular like what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.270" end="00:28:12.740" style="s2">myths do you see emerging well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.670" end="00:28:15.260" style="s2">some of the myths are our artists or</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.740" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">their throwbacks I mean I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.260" end="00:28:20.600" style="s2">conspiracy theories are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">mythology they are people are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.600" end="00:28:25.340" style="s2">patterns that they think give a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.810" style="s2">narrative explanation and so conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.340" end="00:28:28.310" style="s2">theories are now blossoming and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.810" end="00:28:31.400" style="s2">taking off and they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.310" end="00:28:34.070" style="s2">dangerous apparently they are burning</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.400" end="00:28:36.890" style="s2">some people are burning the towers for</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.070" end="00:28:40.010" style="s2">5g network in England because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.890" end="00:28:41.810" style="s2">conspiracy theory that the 5g network is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.010" end="00:28:43.700" style="s2">actually emanating the virus in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.810" end="00:28:46.130" style="s2">fashion and and the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.700" end="00:28:48.890" style="s2">burning towers it can you feel how</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.130" end="00:28:51.590" style="s2">medieval that is can you just feel it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.890" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">yeah Towers burning yeah you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.590" end="00:28:54.980" style="s2">medieval image</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:59.150" style="s2">for sure yeah yeah and so we&#39;re enacting</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.980" end="00:29:02.570" style="s2">mythology and I think other there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.150" end="00:29:04.910" style="s2">other mythological ways of thinking are</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:08.390" style="s2">going to come to the fore in connection</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.910" end="00:29:10.730" style="s2">with that you know that whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.390" end="00:29:12.620" style="s2">kind of Iron Age mythology or even a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.730" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">Bronze Age maybe in the pre axial where</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.620" end="00:29:17.930" style="s2">you the gods are sort of the invisible</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.890" end="00:29:20.300" style="s2">ubiquitous chaotic figures that slam</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.930" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">into our life willy-nilly and demand</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.300" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">really you know stringent purity codes</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">from us so apparently you know various</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:28.430" style="s2">versions of fundamentalist Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:30.440" style="s2">are now trumpet</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.430" end="00:29:32.750" style="s2">trumpeting that we need to repent and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.440" end="00:29:34.460" style="s2">need you know and that&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.750" end="00:29:35.900" style="s2">solution wasn&#39;t the solution for all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.460" end="00:29:38.770" style="s2">previous plague so I don&#39;t know why they</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.900" end="00:29:40.760" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be a solution this time but</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.770" end="00:29:44.030" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely they&#39;re gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.760" end="00:29:45.860" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s there but part of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.030" end="00:29:47.420" style="s2">you know especially the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.860" end="00:29:49.250" style="s2">that I just had there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.420" end="00:29:51.380" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve had well yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.250" end="00:29:55.580" style="s2">one that&#39;s coming out of my channel</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:58.490" style="s2">today with Zack Stein and inter Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.580" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">Kazak wrote this amazing I recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.490" end="00:30:05.180" style="s2">highly the essay the war in heaven broke</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:07.310" style="s2">out where he talks about how people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.180" end="00:30:10.910" style="s2">being thrown into sort of mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.310" end="00:30:13.460" style="s2">ways of thinking because we&#39;re falling</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.910" end="00:30:16.220" style="s2">back on sort of our most comprehensively</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.220" end="00:30:21.320" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would put it I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:24.770" style="s2">that would disagree with me and that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.320" end="00:30:27.470" style="s2">need to properly remember because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.770" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">have deeply forgotten that education has</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:53.660" style="s2">aspects of the psyche and the rational</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:56.300" style="s2">parts of the psyche and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.660" end="00:30:58.910" style="s2">interpersonal parts of the psyche are in</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.300" end="00:31:00.860" style="s2">much better conversation with each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.910" end="00:31:02.210" style="s2">and so we have to we have to develop the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.860" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">conversation within the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.210" end="00:31:05.690" style="s2">without in a coordinated fashion much</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.690" end="00:31:09.019" style="s2">so there&#39;s all those negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:12.259" style="s2">mythologies coming up but Zacks point is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.019" end="00:31:14.690" style="s2">there&#39;s also crisis right critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.259" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">period he plays on that beautifully as</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.690" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">like in development you know critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:20.360" style="s2">periods of development the sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.820" style="s2">periods and he says we are in such a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.360" end="00:31:23.990" style="s2">critical period and he also and I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.820" end="00:31:25.940" style="s2">this because I talked to him directly</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.990" end="00:31:28.460" style="s2">about this he means like a criticality</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.940" end="00:31:30.230" style="s2">within a self-organizing system we&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.970" end="00:31:38.779" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff is coming up but but</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.029" end="00:31:41.029" style="s2">you know like I said we don&#39;t have the</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.840" end="00:32:14.029" style="s2">and it permeates out that&#39;s a new way of</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.029" end="00:32:19.450" style="s2">we and Zacks point is that mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.789" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">stuff coming up is really good</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.450" end="00:32:25.070" style="s2">diagnostic that we are in a liminal</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:27.620" style="s2">period where if we were to do the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.070" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">kind of educational program we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.620" end="00:32:33.350" style="s2">open up new ways to being what does that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:35.269" style="s2">mean exactly like what is he talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.350" end="00:32:37.549" style="s2">about public education and education in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.269" end="00:32:42.200" style="s2">schools is he talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.549" end="00:32:45.139" style="s2">types of conversations that no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.200" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">excellent and what I think I mean I need</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.139" end="00:32:48.230" style="s2">to know more I need you to read his book</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:50.389" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve only had a few conversations</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.230" end="00:32:52.850" style="s2">with him and I&#39;ve only read the essay</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.389" end="00:32:55.370" style="s2">but what I can gather from those</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.850" end="00:32:57.470" style="s2">conversations and Zach if I misrepresent</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.370" end="00:33:01.490" style="s2">you I apologize I invite you to correct</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.470" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">me he such as he&#39;s such a sweet my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.490" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful to talk to him he&#39;s jumpy</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:10.450" style="s2">oh my gosh he&#39;s his his conversational</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:13.850" style="s2">presence is so it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s oh I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.450" end="00:33:17.330" style="s2">love talking with him but anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.850" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">think Katie what he&#39;s recommending is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.330" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">a is a rican sexual</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.190" end="00:33:23.510" style="s2">nation as fundamental as like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">Socrates is doing with the axial</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.510" end="00:33:28.840" style="s2">revolution where all of those boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:31.580" style="s2">and distinctions you just mentioned are</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.840" end="00:33:34.780" style="s2">challenged that that sort of structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.580" end="00:33:37.250" style="s2">of intelligibility is undermined in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.780" end="00:33:39.560" style="s2">significant way so he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.250" end="00:33:41.620" style="s2">fact that we are already we are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.560" end="00:33:43.820" style="s2">desert but the fact of we are already</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.620" end="00:33:46.130" style="s2">decentralizing education massively right</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.820" end="00:33:49.070" style="s2">now and the lines between you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.130" end="00:33:50.870" style="s2">government sanctioned education and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.070" end="00:33:53.390" style="s2">know entertainment stuff that people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.870" end="00:33:55.190" style="s2">doing that&#39;s all massively blurring like</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.390" end="00:33:57.080" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at rebel wisdom for</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.190" end="00:33:59.180" style="s2">example you have this huge thing and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.080" end="00:34:01.910" style="s2">these people talking and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.180" end="00:34:05.180" style="s2">scientists and intellectual like is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.910" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">education well yes but but it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.180" end="00:34:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not right right and so he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:12.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s what what he mean he said</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.160" end="00:34:14.690" style="s2">we&#39;re already doing it but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:18.050" style="s2">just letting it unfold you have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.690" end="00:34:20.780" style="s2">opportunity here to say wait let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.050" end="00:34:23.510" style="s2">give up this lets Institute it in some</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.780" end="00:34:26.090" style="s2">way and remember people did that after</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.510" end="00:34:28.040" style="s2">you know the Depression and World War</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.090" end="00:34:30.530" style="s2">two the stuff they put in place the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.040" end="00:34:32.150" style="s2">changes they made right some of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.530" end="00:34:34.580" style="s2">people said no no we&#39;re not going back</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.150" end="00:34:37.370" style="s2">to what it was like before this we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.580" end="00:34:38.660" style="s2">gonna keep these changes in place now</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.370" end="00:34:40.640" style="s2">there were there were also</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.660" end="00:34:42.710" style="s2">countervailing things because there was</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.640" end="00:34:44.570" style="s2">also a huge nostalgic thing and so there</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.710" end="00:34:46.220" style="s2">was a battle so you know the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.570" end="00:34:48.860" style="s2">in the 50s about trying to get women</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.220" end="00:34:50.600" style="s2">back into the home right precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.860" end="00:34:52.550" style="s2">because why didn&#39;t they have to do and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.600" end="00:34:54.260" style="s2">clamping down on movies like camp</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.550" end="00:34:57.170" style="s2">clamping clamping down on film noir</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.260" end="00:34:59.620" style="s2">right because there was there was there</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.170" end="00:35:02.570" style="s2">was an attempt to well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.620" end="00:35:04.820" style="s2">permeate these changes and make them the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.570" end="00:35:06.650" style="s2">new way and they they partially</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.820" end="00:35:08.600" style="s2">succeeded but there was resistance and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.650" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">they partially failed and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.600" end="00:35:13.640" style="s2">Zak is saying is we&#39;re facing a similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:15.890" style="s2">situation with respect to education we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.640" end="00:35:20.120" style="s2">need to we need to we see education in</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.890" end="00:35:22.870" style="s2">light of enculturation rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.120" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">in the light of facilitating market</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.870" end="00:35:27.980" style="s2">market functionality yeah I completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">agree with that that education needs to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.980" end="00:35:32.390" style="s2">be revolutionized and and decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:33.980" style="s2">as you mentioned actually that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.390" end="00:35:35.690" style="s2">kind of my original vision for this</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:38.539" style="s2">channel we originally called it higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.690" end="00:35:39.859" style="s2">dimensional education as you said like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.539" end="00:35:42.200" style="s2">it you know justjust having</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.859" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">conversations with with knowledgeable</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.200" end="00:35:48.289" style="s2">people can can be very educational and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:50.150" style="s2">and a lot of times the way that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.289" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">envision the the decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.150" end="00:35:54.170" style="s2">happening is well instead of having this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:35:55.549" style="s2">top-down thing where you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.170" end="00:35:57.559" style="s2">this source of all knowledge and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.549" end="00:35:58.789" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the kind of elders and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.559" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">then there&#39;s the people that and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.789" end="00:36:02.990" style="s2">the information of the knowledge flow in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">one direction generally and and the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.990" end="00:36:06.710" style="s2">that I see it working in the future is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:08.089" style="s2">that the teacher everybody&#39;s a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.710" end="00:36:09.079" style="s2">basically like you you you learn</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.089" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">something from somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.079" end="00:36:12.049" style="s2">knowledgeable and then you immediately</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:13.849" style="s2">go and teach that to somebody else well</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.049" end="00:36:16.190" style="s2">let me play with it a little bit more if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.849" end="00:36:18.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t mind because notice what</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.190" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you&#39;re saying okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.500" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">Iron Age hierarchical model we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:25.730" style="s2">put that aside so but let&#39;s look let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:27.650" style="s2">pay attention to what&#39;s actually already</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.730" end="00:36:29.930" style="s2">happening so think about how the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.650" end="00:36:31.910" style="s2">internet is organized it&#39;s not organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.930" end="00:36:33.079" style="s2">hierarchically and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.910" end="00:36:34.069" style="s2">that&#39;s happening is the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.079" end="00:36:37.099" style="s2">start that have now been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.069" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">fractured exactly it has given us not</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.099" end="00:36:41.809" style="s2">which is sort of a silver lining I</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">suppose so how is the internet organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.809" end="00:36:47.059" style="s2">it&#39;s organized as a massively recursive</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.500" style="s2">dynamical small world network it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.059" end="00:36:50.029" style="s2">small world networks a small world</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.500" end="00:36:53.660" style="s2">networks to dynamically recursive</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.029" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">exactly the same kind of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.660" end="00:37:01.039" style="s2">structure that your brain has yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">could organ instead of just the medium</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.039" end="00:37:06.500" style="s2">as actually like our brains are in deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:10.150" style="s2">conformity with how we could be using</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.500" end="00:37:14.329" style="s2">this medium for educational purposes</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.150" end="00:37:15.829" style="s2">yeah yeah I completely agree as as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.329" end="00:37:17.660" style="s2">closer that we can get the internet to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.829" end="00:37:19.369" style="s2">model what our brains are already doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.660" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">the smarter hopefully the internet can</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.369" end="00:37:25.369" style="s2">become well that&#39;s that&#39;s definitely the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:28.970" style="s2">case but also the fact that we like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.369" end="00:37:30.920" style="s2">all please we&#39;re cyborgs we always have</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.970" end="00:37:33.559" style="s2">the capacity to also conform ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.920" end="00:37:35.240" style="s2">to our emergent technologies now this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.559" end="00:37:38.119" style="s2">a hyper object to use Morton&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.240" end="00:37:40.849" style="s2">technology it has almost like a god-like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.119" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">status right and so our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.849" end="00:37:45.559" style="s2">it is going to be very very profound and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.339" style="s2">comprehensive if we as we try to conform</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.559" end="00:37:49.459" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.339" end="00:37:53.420" style="s2">as I&#39;m saying what if what if we</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.459" end="00:37:56.059" style="s2">realized hey things auction can work and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.420" end="00:37:59.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to belong to Iron Age</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.059" end="00:38:02.539" style="s2">hierarchies in order to work what if we</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.630" end="00:38:04.759" style="s2">really realize that it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.539" end="00:38:06.859" style="s2">happening and it&#39;s way our brain is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.759" end="00:38:10.390" style="s2">already set up and ready to work and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.859" end="00:38:12.380" style="s2">would love to be moving around right in</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.390" end="00:38:14.630" style="s2">dynamically recursive small world</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.380" end="00:38:18.049" style="s2">network because that&#39;s what it likes</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.630" end="00:38:21.410" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works so what if what if</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.049" end="00:38:23.140" style="s2">we really open that up as a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.410" end="00:38:24.799" style="s2">rather than just something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.140" end="00:38:28.189" style="s2">technologically happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.799" end="00:38:31.420" style="s2">background what if we said wait wait we</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.189" end="00:38:34.689" style="s2">really don&#39;t have to have hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.420" end="00:38:37.160" style="s2">organizations to make things work well</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.689" end="00:38:38.689" style="s2">what yeah I mean I would say something</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.160" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">like the Internet I do still see</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.689" end="00:38:42.829" style="s2">hierarchies it&#39;s just that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:44.089" style="s2">hierarchies are are flexible and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.829" end="00:38:46.779" style="s2">like feedback loops within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.089" end="00:38:49.009" style="s2">hierarchies like you&#39;re saying like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.779" end="00:38:50.420" style="s2">so I mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.009" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">a forum or something like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.420" end="00:38:54.140" style="s2">not much of a hierarchy but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:56.839" style="s2">talking about like YouTube channels</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.140" end="00:38:58.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a person or people who are kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.839" end="00:39:00.920" style="s2">of leading a conversation but then what</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.910" end="00:39:02.630" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is influenced by their</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.920" end="00:39:04.549" style="s2">commenters and is influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.630" end="00:39:06.969" style="s2">guests who have their own kind of nodes</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.549" end="00:39:09.979" style="s2">that are influenced their commoners yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.969" end="00:39:11.299" style="s2">their guests but they&#39;re still there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.979" end="00:39:13.549" style="s2">all these mini</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.299" end="00:39:15.410" style="s2">hierarchies going on all the time well</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.549" end="00:39:17.509" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not really like getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.410" end="00:39:19.189" style="s2">hierarchy but more just like forcing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.509" end="00:39:20.989" style="s2">hierarchies to constantly adapt and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.189" end="00:39:23.329" style="s2">readjust afire themselves otherwise they</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.989" end="00:39:26.329" style="s2">disappear but are they I want to push</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.329" end="00:39:28.249" style="s2">back on you because I mean a small world</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.329" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">network is it amorphous you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.249" end="00:39:32.660" style="s2">centralized hubs right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:35.209" style="s2">things that are larger in the network as</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.660" end="00:39:36.709" style="s2">their hubs and and that&#39;s what but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.209" end="00:39:38.509" style="s2">that there are multiple hubs and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.709" end="00:39:41.569" style="s2">shift around and the hubs are dependent</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.509" end="00:39:44.869" style="s2">on their right so a small world network</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.569" end="00:39:46.459" style="s2">has it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s not an equity</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.869" end="00:39:48.410" style="s2">structure in which everything is getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.459" end="00:39:49.640" style="s2">equal input and output that&#39;s not what a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.410" end="00:39:51.739" style="s2">small world network is that&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.640" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">brain is either so you think about even</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.739" end="00:39:56.749" style="s2">then you&#39;d the YouTube superstars right</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:59.269" style="s2">they&#39;re always they&#39;re always in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.749" end="00:39:59.700" style="s2">even those hubs are dependent on how</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.269" end="00:40:01.109" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.700" end="00:40:02.700" style="s2">the other hubs that are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.109" end="00:40:04.829" style="s2">other networks and it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:07.079" style="s2">shifting around that&#39;s a lot different</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.829" end="00:40:10.530" style="s2">you know so let&#39;s take a classic example</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.079" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">of a hierarchy like like feudalism right</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.530" end="00:40:15.990" style="s2">and right it&#39;s the whole point of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:18.059" style="s2">structure and status the whole point is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.990" end="00:40:20.010" style="s2">you know conserving because you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.059" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">scarcity situation right you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.010" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">scarcity situation and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2">hierarchies make sense in scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.589" style="s2">situations because they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.140" end="00:40:30.540" style="s2">conservative right and and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.589" end="00:40:33.930" style="s2">you need in scarcity but we&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.540" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2">in a information scarcity situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.930" end="00:40:38.099" style="s2">that&#39;s in fact what we&#39;re discovering</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:41.640" style="s2">we&#39;re discovering that wait while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.099" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">facing all this economic loss we</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.640" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">actually have it&#39;s we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">information scarcity that&#39;s not where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:51.780" style="s2">are at all so I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:53.910" style="s2">like even think about even like Joe</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.780" end="00:40:55.829" style="s2">Rogan I don&#39;t like Joe Rogan but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.910" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">just using as an example you know he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.829" end="00:40:58.980" style="s2">just doing his thing and his</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">entertainment and then he got called to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.980" end="00:41:04.349" style="s2">task or when he had a okay member who</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:05.700" style="s2">was had somebody on his David fuller was</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.349" end="00:41:07.890" style="s2">talking about this he had somebody on</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.700" end="00:41:10.380" style="s2">his show and he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.890" end="00:41:12.420" style="s2">properly grill him and all the people of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.380" end="00:41:14.309" style="s2">its network all the people said what</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.420" end="00:41:17.430" style="s2">what are you doing there&#39;s a of Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.309" end="00:41:20.010" style="s2">I think it was yeah yeah yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.430" end="00:41:22.650" style="s2">like no no and he then he then had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.010" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">adopt a new role and it was not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.650" end="00:41:26.819" style="s2">that is that you know other other no</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:28.920" style="s2">other other of the you know of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.819" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">central hubs in that small world network</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.920" end="00:41:33.299" style="s2">we&#39;re also sort of sort of repositioning</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:35.430" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.299" end="00:41:37.079" style="s2">yeah I agree with you it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.430" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">different I think it could kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.079" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">seen in both ways maybe where you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">clarify it for me was like I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:43.770" style="s2">imagining when you were describing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.790" style="s2">network I was imagining something</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.770" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2">flatter that didn&#39;t have these like</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.790" end="00:41:52.260" style="s2">Peaks no yeah so small world networks</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:54.180" style="s2">are like if you if you look at them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.260" end="00:41:56.730" style="s2">Papa graphically like they have hubs</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.180" end="00:41:57.990" style="s2">right and like this so you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.730" end="00:42:00.869" style="s2">areas that are tightly clustered</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.990" end="00:42:02.670" style="s2">together right and and then and then and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.869" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">then and then they have looser</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.670" end="00:42:06.380" style="s2">connections to other clusters and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">they&#39;re constantly shifting around</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.380" end="00:42:11.130" style="s2">interestingly when I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:13.380" style="s2">norbade Center she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.130" end="00:42:14.970" style="s2">oh okay let me talk about her because</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.380" end="00:42:16.260" style="s2">this is an example of exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.970" end="00:42:20.040" style="s2">trying to talk about how we can change</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.260" end="00:42:21.360" style="s2">the education okay so I&#39;m hoping with</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.040" end="00:42:23.130" style="s2">that she and I get to talk again we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.360" end="00:42:25.110" style="s2">really hit it off she&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:26.130" style="s2">daughter of Gregory Bateson I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.110" end="00:42:28.080" style="s2">if you guys know he&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.130" end="00:42:30.360" style="s2">founding figures of complexity thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.080" end="00:42:32.130" style="s2">and yeah yeah his son Erik of a Tiki</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.360" end="00:42:36.360" style="s2">OSIS basin activates and actually design</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.130" end="00:42:37.770" style="s2">my program at UBC amazing yeah so she</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.360" end="00:42:39.450" style="s2">has a thing that she calls warm data</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.770" end="00:42:40.920" style="s2">labs and I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.450" end="00:42:43.160" style="s2">because of the project I&#39;m doing on</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.920" end="00:42:45.870" style="s2">dialectic and Dia logos but think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.160" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">Katie this I&#39;ll show you what I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.870" end="00:42:50.190" style="s2">what you do is you do we have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:52.590" style="s2">assembly and then you know a few people</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.190" end="00:42:54.390" style="s2">speak or else we have sort of uh here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.590" end="00:42:56.070" style="s2">the speaker and then it&#39;s a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.390" end="00:42:58.140" style="s2">now what you do is you break everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.070" end="00:43:00.600" style="s2">up into groups small groups and each</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.140" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">group goes and talks about health right</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.600" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">and but what happens is individuals from</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:06.840" style="s2">group if I&#39;m in this group at some point</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:08.220" style="s2">I might get up and go all the way over</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.840" end="00:43:11.820" style="s2">to that group and then join that group</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.220" end="00:43:13.860" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m this disruptive right figure I</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.820" end="00:43:15.690" style="s2">come in and I disrupt that group and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.860" end="00:43:17.250" style="s2">then they reconfigure and then and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.690" end="00:43:19.260" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got is you&#39;ve actually got a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.250" end="00:43:20.910" style="s2">small world network that&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.260" end="00:43:22.950" style="s2">dynamically reconfigure ating</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.910" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">reconfiguring itself and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.950" end="00:43:25.890" style="s2">cool about that is you get like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:27.660" style="s2">distributed socrates there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.890" end="00:43:30.270" style="s2">person that&#39;s taking the role of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.660" end="00:43:32.430" style="s2">socrates but the system is set up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.270" end="00:43:34.350" style="s2">constantly provoke itself and disturb</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.430" end="00:43:36.660" style="s2">itself and disrupt itself and you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.350" end="00:43:38.460" style="s2">this dynamical small world network and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.660" end="00:43:40.470" style="s2">when people come back to the group</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.460" end="00:43:44.610" style="s2">discussion they&#39;ve got sort of this deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.470" end="00:43:46.710" style="s2">understanding of the topic that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.610" end="00:43:50.340" style="s2">sounds like the correct way to design a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.710" end="00:43:52.190" style="s2">really good party I&#39;m really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.340" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">party so I don&#39;t know about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.190" end="00:43:56.580" style="s2">but but she&#39;s getting a lot of success</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">with it what she means by warm data by</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.580" end="00:44:02.730" style="s2">the way is many of the issues were</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:04.710" style="s2">facing our dynamic pretty complex and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.730" end="00:44:07.020" style="s2">are immersed in them and so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.710" end="00:44:09.360" style="s2">rely on sort of cold data abstract we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.020" end="00:44:12.150" style="s2">have to rely on warm data data that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.360" end="00:44:14.340" style="s2">process within the complexity and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.150" end="00:44:15.780" style="s2">she&#39;s trying to can see what like I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.340" end="00:44:17.640" style="s2">well I&#39;m so interested in this because</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.780" end="00:44:20.580" style="s2">this is a way I think of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.640" end="00:44:23.370" style="s2">you know a virtual distributed Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.580" end="00:44:25.090" style="s2">into these into these situations without</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.370" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">somebody necessarily having</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.090" end="00:44:30.220" style="s2">be the complete figure of Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:31.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by you know a</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.220" end="00:44:34.300" style="s2">dynamically recursive small world</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.690" end="00:44:37.030" style="s2">network okay yeah I like that I see I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.300" end="00:44:38.260" style="s2">see where you&#39;re going now so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.030" end="00:44:40.150" style="s2">slightly unclear on the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.260" end="00:44:44.280" style="s2">warm data yeah what is what does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.150" end="00:44:48.130" style="s2">mean exactly so III guess the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.280" end="00:44:50.680" style="s2">inspiration I think this is right you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.130" end="00:44:52.870" style="s2">think about like ethnographic data like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.680" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">what anthropologists do so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.870" end="00:44:56.350" style="s2">you can&#39;t study a culture from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">outside you have to go there and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">have to go through the difficult process</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.790" end="00:45:00.940" style="s2">of enculturation because a culture is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:02.290" style="s2">something that you could only know well</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.940" end="00:45:03.970" style="s2">I would say in a prospective and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.290" end="00:45:06.790" style="s2">participatory fashion you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.970" end="00:45:09.220" style="s2">immersed in its dynamics immersed in its</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.790" end="00:45:11.710" style="s2">ongoing complexity in order to fully</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.220" end="00:45:14.830" style="s2">understand what a culture is and her</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.710" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">point is that many of the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.830" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">cultures of coffee is is a hyper object</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:25.120" style="s2">right and so many of the things we face</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:29.350" style="s2">many of the problems we face are also</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.120" end="00:45:32.440" style="s2">hyper objective like that and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.350" end="00:45:34.780" style="s2">only understand and and and and we only</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.440" end="00:45:37.870" style="s2">can understand them insofar as we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.780" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">immersed and participating right within</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.870" end="00:45:42.760" style="s2">their commits complexity I see so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:44.530" style="s2">kind of like you&#39;re going around and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.760" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">trying different perspectives on and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.530" end="00:45:47.980" style="s2">you&#39;re and you&#39;re able to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:49.990" style="s2">data from from different points of view</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.980" end="00:45:52.120" style="s2">and and in that way the data is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.990" end="00:45:53.410" style="s2">alive or anything like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.120" end="00:45:55.540" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something much more that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.410" end="00:45:57.580" style="s2">like the platonic dialogue rather than</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.540" end="00:45:59.380" style="s2">the Aristotelian monologue you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.580" end="00:46:02.380" style="s2">trying to say oh I what I can do is get</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.380" end="00:46:04.300" style="s2">to the the the you know the the view</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.380" end="00:46:06.550" style="s2">from above that&#39;s the view from nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.300" end="00:46:09.850" style="s2">you know enables sense you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.550" end="00:46:12.190" style="s2">get you can&#39;t abstract abstract yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.850" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">up out of it you know you&#39;ll in fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.190" end="00:46:19.780" style="s2">lose it or the phenomena and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:24.130" style="s2">to always be looking for warm data data</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.780" end="00:46:26.980" style="s2">that that you are actively right and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.130" end="00:46:32.890" style="s2">I would say also salience like bound to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.980" end="00:46:33.990" style="s2">in order to get into the right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.890" end="00:46:37.050" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.990" end="00:46:40.470" style="s2">with the fenomena in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.050" end="00:46:42.119" style="s2">intervene in it and modify it as wisely</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.470" end="00:46:44.099" style="s2">as possible that&#39;s what I think she</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.119" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">means it&#39;s interesting and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.099" end="00:46:48.030" style="s2">also connects to something we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:49.859" style="s2">talk about in our in our time section</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.030" end="00:46:52.070" style="s2">relating to time like well listening to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.859" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">you talking to Christopher and Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.070" end="00:46:56.030" style="s2">you you guys are kind of taught you in</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">Chris we&#39;re kind of talking a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.030" end="00:47:00.180" style="s2">like how this is changing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:02.520" style="s2">understanding of time or experience of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.180" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">time and it got me thinking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.520" end="00:47:07.430" style="s2">like are you familiar with Walter</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:10.410" style="s2">Benjamin&#39;s concept of messianic time I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.430" end="00:47:13.050" style="s2">have a meta memory I know I have come</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.410" end="00:47:14.099" style="s2">across this before but I I could I could</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.050" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">not speak to it at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.099" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">so start talking I&#39;ll probably go oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.970" style="s2">yeah okay yeah let&#39;s get like a brief</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.650" style="s2">summary it&#39;s a basically the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:24.030" style="s2">like um they&#39;ve got a manger because a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.650" end="00:47:26.700" style="s2">conception of time which is very like</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.030" end="00:47:27.960" style="s2">view from above mm-hmm according to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.700" end="00:47:30.030" style="s2">Benjamin like we tend to view time as</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.960" end="00:47:32.460" style="s2">being kind of empty and linear and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">just time is just like the homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.460" end="00:47:36.810" style="s2">in that way whereas he he proposes like</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:39.030" style="s2">an alternative view of time called which</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.810" end="00:47:40.500" style="s2">he calls messianic time where like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.030" end="00:47:42.599" style="s2">past is kind of illuminated by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.500" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">present or like certain moments of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.599" end="00:47:45.660" style="s2">past are like charged by what said</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.130" style="s2">whatever is happening in the present so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.660" end="00:47:49.950" style="s2">we end up with like a constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.130" end="00:47:52.260" style="s2">events like connecting the past to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.950" end="00:47:53.580" style="s2">present and it just even like listening</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.260" end="00:47:54.750" style="s2">to you now it really makes me think of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.580" end="00:47:57.650" style="s2">it because you can you&#39;re invoking like</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.750" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">you know World War 1 World War 2 the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.650" end="00:48:01.470" style="s2">Hellenistic dhama side and like all</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:04.349" style="s2">these events and I&#39;m just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.470" end="00:48:08.220" style="s2">wondering like in that conception like</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.349" end="00:48:08.940" style="s2">how is our past no that&#39;s good that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.220" end="00:48:10.980" style="s2">that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.940" end="00:48:13.020" style="s2">so I mean I was using more Tillich here</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.980" end="00:48:15.869" style="s2">and but the connection to messianic is</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.020" end="00:48:17.910" style="s2">appropriate because the the some</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.869" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2">teleca&#39;s of protestant theologian right</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.910" end="00:48:23.220" style="s2">he&#39;s sort of post christian in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:25.740" style="s2">important ways he was the guy who talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.220" end="00:48:29.010" style="s2">about the god beyond god did that beyond</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.740" end="00:48:30.390" style="s2">the god of theism but he is from him</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.010" end="00:48:32.760" style="s2">that I learned this notion of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.390" end="00:48:35.580" style="s2">within Kairos means the fullness of time</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.760" end="00:48:38.070" style="s2">rather than an empty time and so what it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.580" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">means there&#39;s mo and there&#39;s a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.070" end="00:48:43.380" style="s2">in which most most of the time reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:46.380" style="s2">the unfolding of time has this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.380" end="00:48:47.320" style="s2">inertia to it it&#39;s what unfolding and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.380" end="00:48:50.830" style="s2">are just sort of swept</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.320" end="00:48:54.370" style="s2">and we can&#39;t do very much but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.830" end="00:48:55.930" style="s2">is there there are points in the course</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.370" end="00:49:00.130" style="s2">of time when you think of it like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.930" end="00:49:02.850" style="s2">river where the conditions that have</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.130" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">been generated by time actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.850" end="00:49:07.810" style="s2">destabilize and what you have is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:10.510" style="s2">have a bunch of conditions that emerge</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.810" end="00:49:12.670" style="s2">such that it is possible for things for</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.510" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2">the course of that River to suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.670" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">change its directions and the idea in</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:20.950" style="s2">the Gospels was and I think it also in</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:22.660" style="s2">Paul that Jesus Christ comes in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.950" end="00:49:25.690" style="s2">fullness of time he comes at just that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.660" end="00:49:29.080" style="s2">moment where if he if he to come</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.690" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">somewhere else and at some other time</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.080" end="00:49:33.160" style="s2">then right things wouldn&#39;t have shifted</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:35.140" style="s2">and turned and the kingdom of God</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.160" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have had vented the way it did</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.140" end="00:49:39.610" style="s2">and so you can think about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:42.490" style="s2">Kairos carries with it this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.610" end="00:49:44.650" style="s2">past skelion sense of finesse right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.490" end="00:49:46.360" style="s2">our previous time is like gee like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.650" end="00:49:48.370" style="s2">spirit of geometry we just calculated</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.360" end="00:49:49.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s geometrical and we can just</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.370" end="00:49:52.120" style="s2">calculate it and move through in it that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.840" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">it has that inertial inevitability to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.120" end="00:49:58.020" style="s2">but when we get to Kairos we now move</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">into finessed where you know a real e</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.020" end="00:50:03.130" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:05.140" style="s2">acute and a sensitivity to timing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.130" end="00:50:07.210" style="s2">placement now become crucial and you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.140" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">see this in dynamical systems when they</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.210" end="00:50:10.150" style="s2">go into a state of criticality you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.130" style="s2">sensitive dependence on initial</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.150" end="00:50:14.470" style="s2">conditions when they&#39;re in criticality</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.130" end="00:50:16.150" style="s2">things that would have not like very</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.470" end="00:50:19.060" style="s2">small effects that would have largely</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.150" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">just been absorbed by the system very</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.060" end="00:50:24.430" style="s2">small events can have huge consequences</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:27.820" style="s2">they can suddenly massively ramify out</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.430" end="00:50:30.910" style="s2">throughout the system so Kairos is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.820" end="00:50:34.810" style="s2">kind of criticality and and what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.910" end="00:50:37.600" style="s2">Tillich was talking about was that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.810" end="00:50:38.920" style="s2">have this relationship for time and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.600" end="00:50:40.300" style="s2">using that he doesn&#39;t use this language</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.920" end="00:50:42.700" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s fair to him where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.300" end="00:50:44.770" style="s2">shift from this sort of geometry to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.700" end="00:50:47.050" style="s2">spirit of finesse in your experience in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.770" end="00:50:48.850" style="s2">time and that&#39;s really important because</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.050" end="00:50:51.160" style="s2">given what you know given some of Hans</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.850" end="00:50:52.630" style="s2">criticisms brilliant criticisms in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.160" end="00:50:55.060" style="s2">center of time where we had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.630" end="00:50:57.070" style="s2">atomized the time the time in no way</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.060" end="00:50:59.170" style="s2">unfolded right it was just atomized</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.070" end="00:51:00.730" style="s2">these discrete moments that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.170" end="00:51:04.420" style="s2">disconnected and just by</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.730" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">and don&#39;t matter in any way we when we</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.420" end="00:51:09.160" style="s2">come into Kairos that hold geometric</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.490" end="00:51:11.530" style="s2">spatialization and autumn ization of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.160" end="00:51:14.340" style="s2">experience of time collapses and we get</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.530" end="00:51:16.780" style="s2">into the spirit of finesse kirkland</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.340" end="00:51:19.090" style="s2">interesting actually that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.780" end="00:51:21.700" style="s2">as you were saying that that that time</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.090" end="00:51:23.590" style="s2">had become atomized it reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.700" end="00:51:26.110" style="s2">how like physically and psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.590" end="00:51:29.110" style="s2">we&#39;ve become atomized and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.110" end="00:51:30.460" style="s2">about how you were you were saying you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.110" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">know we should form ourselves into small</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.460" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">mode networks and then I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:38.170" style="s2">does time form itself into small small</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">world networks no time is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.170" end="00:51:41.170" style="s2">great mysteries I mean we try to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:43.750" style="s2">into the ontology of time you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.170" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">moving beyond I can I&#39;m talking more</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.750" end="00:51:47.500" style="s2">just about the phenomenology of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:50.290" style="s2">whatever it is that we&#39;re all sending to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.500" end="00:51:51.820" style="s2">in our phenomenology go ahead I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.290" end="00:51:53.710" style="s2">gonna say it&#39;s kind of implicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.820" end="00:51:54.430" style="s2">concept of messianic time - and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.710" end="00:51:56.170" style="s2">really interesting cuz you&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.430" end="00:51:57.850" style="s2">saying that like in Kairos we are more</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.170" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">inhabiting messianic time than other</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.850" end="00:52:02.740" style="s2">times yes yeah it&#39;s like part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:04.540" style="s2">idea is that like um instead of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.740" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">time is like a series of atomized events</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.540" end="00:52:08.200" style="s2">like when something happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:09.970" style="s2">present that like charges certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.200" end="00:52:12.010" style="s2">moments of the past we&#39;re in a way like</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.970" end="00:52:16.860" style="s2">fulfilling those moments yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.010" end="00:52:19.660" style="s2">we&#39;re those moments yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.860" end="00:52:20.560" style="s2">again it reminds me of the the warm data</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.660" end="00:52:23.290" style="s2">thing that you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.560" end="00:52:24.850" style="s2">where if we if we happen to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.290" end="00:52:26.820" style="s2">right place at the right time then we</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.850" end="00:52:29.920" style="s2">get connected with a network of other</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.820" end="00:52:32.850" style="s2">connected events in the past and and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.920" end="00:52:34.480" style="s2">we even get this yeah we can kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.850" end="00:52:36.520" style="s2">hadn&#39;t thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.480" end="00:52:38.860" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s also a shift between a cold</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.520" end="00:52:40.450" style="s2">date of view of time and a warmed date</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.860" end="00:52:42.820" style="s2">of view of time yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.450" end="00:52:45.250" style="s2">yeah and the idea of charge I like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.820" end="00:52:47.560" style="s2">I like that Oriole it&#39;s like yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.250" end="00:52:50.590" style="s2">that captures the fullness of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.560" end="00:52:53.100" style="s2">that&#39;s in Kairos that somehow the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.590" end="00:52:56.020" style="s2">happening in the present discloses the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.100" end="00:52:58.510" style="s2">potentiality of past events that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.020" end="00:53:00.520" style="s2">buried under the inertial inevitability</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.510" end="00:53:03.100" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.520" end="00:53:05.530" style="s2">and and encompass that thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.100" end="00:53:09.430" style="s2">well but it&#39;s still good it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.530" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">apropos and you can see why we would</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.430" end="00:53:13.380" style="s2">then be thrown back on mythopoetic ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:16.440" style="s2">of thinking because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.380" end="00:53:19.530" style="s2">moving out of geometrical time into</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.440" end="00:53:22.110" style="s2">right into finesse time in the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.530" end="00:53:26.610" style="s2">time yeah yeah and so we&#39;re gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.110" end="00:53:30.630" style="s2">for these these sort of deep perennial</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.610" end="00:53:32.460" style="s2">narrative patterns to try and get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.630" end="00:53:34.140" style="s2">fullness of time I hadn&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.460" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">that but those two belong together very</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.140" end="00:53:38.370" style="s2">deeply I think you said something when</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:40.860" style="s2">you were talking about how you felt like</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.370" end="00:53:42.330" style="s2">this might not be or this probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.860" end="00:53:44.040" style="s2">be the only pandemic and I&#39;m referring</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.330" end="00:53:45.900" style="s2">to when you were on the the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.040" end="00:53:49.350" style="s2">Kairos conversation you said something</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.900" end="00:53:51.180" style="s2">like culture doesn&#39;t usually change</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.350" end="00:53:53.490" style="s2">things don&#39;t usually change the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.180" end="00:53:55.350" style="s2">time around it&#39;s the second there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.490" end="00:53:56.490" style="s2">fourth time around so that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.350" end="00:53:59.880" style="s2">of reminding me of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.490" end="00:54:01.530" style="s2">like in these moments we we think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.880" end="00:54:04.110" style="s2">what happened in the past that fits this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.530" end="00:54:09.330" style="s2">pattern and so that we can hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.110" end="00:54:10.920" style="s2">seize it this time to fulfill like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.330" end="00:54:13.290" style="s2">transition into the new pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.920" end="00:54:16.380" style="s2">maybe that past moment was calling for</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.290" end="00:54:19.170" style="s2">but didn&#39;t push us towards hard enough I</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.380" end="00:54:21.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s right and even that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.170" end="00:54:24.990" style="s2">language again and and this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.840" end="00:54:28.500" style="s2">criticism of you any the sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">called just again harkening right this</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.500" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">is this is a religious sensibility in an</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:36.210" style="s2">important sense and that and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.800" end="00:54:38.520" style="s2">bringing up I think the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.210" end="00:54:40.140" style="s2">sense of prophecy right the Prophet is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.520" end="00:54:43.470" style="s2">not somebody who foretells the future</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.140" end="00:54:45.540" style="s2">but picks up on the Kairos right now by</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.470" end="00:54:47.010" style="s2">appropriately picking up all you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.540" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">security language that you gave to Mira</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.010" end="00:54:50.430" style="s2">picking up on the charge from the past</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:52.620" style="s2">but charge and remember what that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.430" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">initially meant it meant you know a call</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.620" end="00:54:56.670" style="s2">given to you a demand placed on you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:55:00.060" style="s2">right you&#39;re charged with something and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.670" end="00:55:02.490" style="s2">so the I I think we are coming into in</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.060" end="00:55:05.490" style="s2">that sense and I hope people do not</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.490" end="00:55:06.930" style="s2">misunderstand me but in that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.490" end="00:55:08.790" style="s2">I try to articulate very carefully I</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.930" end="00:55:12.750" style="s2">think we are coming into a prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.790" end="00:55:14.220" style="s2">time Jordan Hall talks about something</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.750" end="00:55:15.540" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m gonna use his</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.220" end="00:55:17.490" style="s2">language exactly right but he talks</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.540" end="00:55:20.100" style="s2">about something like attractors like</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.490" end="00:55:22.440" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a system that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.100" end="00:55:24.150" style="s2">revolving around and like working with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.440" end="00:55:25.860" style="s2">certain attractor but there&#39;s always new</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.150" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">attractors springing up all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.860" end="00:55:28.410" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:33.000" style="s2">time&#39;s a crisis happens and in those</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.410" end="00:55:34.859" style="s2">moments patterns that are being like</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.000" end="00:55:37.829" style="s2">revolving around the new truck attractor</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.859" end="00:55:39.210" style="s2">are revealed so like I&#39;m imagining like</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.829" end="00:55:43.020" style="s2">that attractor it could be something</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.210" end="00:55:46.920" style="s2">like the call very much it&#39;s a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.020" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">object that is exerting calling us to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.920" end="00:55:52.440" style="s2">new way of being</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:55.829" style="s2">and but our relationship to it is one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.440" end="00:55:58.020" style="s2">finesse and of one data participation we</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.829" end="00:56:00.119" style="s2">can&#39;t sort of calculate our way into it</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.020" end="00:56:02.789" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to happen and and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.119" end="00:56:05.430" style="s2">that brings up a lot of stuff that I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.789" end="00:56:08.039" style="s2">talking with Jordan about because Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.430" end="00:56:11.130" style="s2">thinks we fall back on mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.039" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">thinking because it&#39;s they are our</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.130" end="00:56:16.049" style="s2">deepest powder well like I was arguing</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:19.049" style="s2">they are our deepest powder and making</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.049" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">machinery they are the ones that have</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.049" end="00:56:23.430" style="s2">survived the most cross contextual</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:25.980" style="s2">change in our biological and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.430" end="00:56:29.970" style="s2">heritage and so they are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.980" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">have the most likely the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.970" end="00:56:33.990" style="s2">chance of being transfer appropriate but</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:35.490" style="s2">precisely because they are so transfer</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.990" end="00:56:37.950" style="s2">appropriate they have to be so they have</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.490" end="00:56:39.299" style="s2">to be whole very symbolic because if</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.950" end="00:56:42.690" style="s2">they were very precise they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.299" end="00:56:45.779" style="s2">transfer well right right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.690" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">so you have this marry it it powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.779" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it survived it&#39;s wired into us</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:52.740" style="s2">it transfers well but it&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:56.369" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s vague and symbolic and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.740" end="00:56:58.349" style="s2">associational and so again he talks</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.369" end="00:57:01.740" style="s2">about a you know meeting to bring any</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.349" end="00:57:03.059" style="s2">kind of integrity and he he would very</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.740" end="00:57:04.859" style="s2">much like as I know is you&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.059" end="00:57:07.260" style="s2">couple conversations about this this</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.859" end="00:57:10.529" style="s2">sense of finesse because he and I have</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.260" end="00:57:14.099" style="s2">been trying to work out a bit of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.529" end="00:57:16.829" style="s2">normativity this aesthetic spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.099" end="00:57:17.940" style="s2">religious normativity that we are needed</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.829" end="00:57:20.549" style="s2">in this time and we&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.940" end="00:57:21.660" style="s2">by trying to and this goes with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.549" end="00:57:23.730" style="s2">discussion we just had about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.660" end="00:57:26.309" style="s2">prophetic time trying to reformulate the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.730" end="00:57:28.500" style="s2">notion of faith and get it to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.309" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">something other than the willful</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.500" end="00:57:32.789" style="s2">assertion of propositions in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:35.369" style="s2">countervailing evidence which is what it</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.789" end="00:57:39.210" style="s2">has come to mean instead coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.369" end="00:57:39.940" style="s2">this idea of faith as that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.210" end="00:57:42.010" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.940" end="00:57:44.590" style="s2">the whole person you know so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.010" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">existential thing not just a skill it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.590" end="00:57:48.970" style="s2">an existential mode that gets you into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">finessed so you have a continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.970" end="00:57:55.150" style="s2">contact with that course of events that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:59.050" style="s2">is moving to the new attractor such that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.150" end="00:58:01.870" style="s2">you get into a right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.050" end="00:58:04.600" style="s2">it that&#39;s the notion of me that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.870" end="00:58:06.100" style="s2">trying to bring back I call it Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.600" end="00:58:08.230" style="s2">faith because I think it is exemplified</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.100" end="00:58:09.370" style="s2">in somebody like Socrates who is very</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.230" end="00:58:11.350" style="s2">unwilling to assert very many</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.370" end="00:58:15.130" style="s2">propositions but nevertheless was</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.350" end="00:58:16.870" style="s2">willing to go to his death so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.130" end="00:58:19.270" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s a different sense of faith</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.870" end="00:58:20.320" style="s2">there that I think we need to try and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.270" end="00:58:22.870" style="s2">bring back and it&#39;s a sense of faith</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.320" end="00:58:25.300" style="s2">it&#39;s interwove and with reason and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.870" end="00:58:27.940" style="s2">wisdom and artistry as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.300" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">opposed to it and dogmatically trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.940" end="00:58:32.620" style="s2">like impose itself another way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:34.150" style="s2">thinking about this sorry for going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.620" end="00:58:36.220" style="s2">but this is an important point to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.150" end="00:58:37.900" style="s2">back to Tillich we&#39;re starting to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.220" end="00:58:40.990" style="s2">this with Andrew Sweeney and Zach&#39;s 9</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.900" end="00:58:43.780" style="s2">you know habermas made this excellent</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.990" end="00:58:46.210" style="s2">point that what Kant did right is he</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.780" end="00:58:48.820" style="s2">takes the Cartesian subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.210" end="00:58:50.320" style="s2">then he turns it into a normativity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.820" end="00:58:52.900" style="s2">when you turn subjectivity into</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.320" end="00:58:54.460" style="s2">normativity you get autonomy and so what</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.900" end="00:58:56.110" style="s2">you get are the three autonomous things</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.460" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">the contrary critique you get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.110" end="00:59:01.510" style="s2">autonomy of reason you get the autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:03.310" style="s2">of aesthetics and you get the autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.510" end="00:59:04.990" style="s2">of morality and we have this three</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.310" end="00:59:06.370" style="s2">discrete Squiers that are in commence</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.990" end="00:59:09.460" style="s2">trouble with each other right you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.370" end="00:59:11.380" style="s2">like science and art and morality right</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.460" end="00:59:15.010" style="s2">and they&#39;re all they&#39;re all autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.380" end="00:59:17.620" style="s2">and then Tillich has this criticism you</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.010" end="00:59:19.540" style="s2">know he says well the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.620" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">autonomy is to get you out of heteronomy</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.540" end="00:59:23.140" style="s2">heteronomy is when out for and some</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:25.690" style="s2">foreign authorities tries to impose</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.140" end="00:59:27.010" style="s2">itself on you he Tillich uses the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.690" end="00:59:29.170" style="s2">biblical image of like demonic</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.010" end="00:59:31.740" style="s2">possession you&#39;re you&#39;re controlled and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.170" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">possessed and manipulated and so we</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.740" end="00:59:37.750" style="s2">brought up a defense of autonomy the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:40.930" style="s2">problem with our normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.750" end="00:59:43.180" style="s2">subjective autonomy is that it has led</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.930" end="00:59:46.150" style="s2">to disconnection fragmentation the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.180" end="00:59:48.910" style="s2">meeting crisis etcetera etc and Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.150" end="00:59:49.730" style="s2">is responding to that in the courage of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.910" end="00:59:51.050" style="s2">EE</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.730" end="00:59:53.420" style="s2">which is another way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.050" end="00:59:55.850" style="s2">the faith that I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.420" end="00:59:59.120" style="s2">courage to be he proponent in his work</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.850" end="01:00:01.880" style="s2">he proposes in and especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.120" end="01:00:05.620" style="s2">systematic theology he opposed it he</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.880" end="01:00:07.670" style="s2">proposes that beyond heteronomy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.620" end="01:00:11.210" style="s2">autonomy is what he calls the enemy</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.670" end="01:00:12.920" style="s2">which you know the normativity of God</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.210" end="01:00:14.990" style="s2">but of course he means the God beyond</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.920" end="01:00:18.230" style="s2">all possible gods he doesn&#39;t mean like</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.990" end="01:00:20.450" style="s2">traditional religious authority what he</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.230" end="01:00:22.520" style="s2">means is exactly what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.450" end="01:00:24.350" style="s2">with you and you I see it when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.520" end="01:00:27.620" style="s2">when I&#39;m in the circling practices with</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.350" end="01:00:30.500" style="s2">people what that in that dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.620" end="01:00:32.930" style="s2">recursive small world networks dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.500" end="01:00:35.180" style="s2">system this third factor appears people</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.930" end="01:00:37.370" style="s2">start feeling but there is something</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.180" end="01:00:42.920" style="s2">above and beyond in them individually</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.370" end="01:00:45.320" style="s2">and they aspire to least it&#39;s funny I</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.920" end="01:00:47.030" style="s2">was talking to Ted about this yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.320" end="01:00:47.510" style="s2">the guy who does the authentic relating</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.030" end="01:00:48.950" style="s2">in Toronto</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.510" end="01:00:50.630" style="s2">all these secular people start using</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.320" end="01:01:42.560" style="s2">of aspiration an aspiration cannot come</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.220" end="01:01:45.860" style="s2">out of my autonomy that&#39;s the no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.560" end="01:01:48.860" style="s2">that calories argument ala Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.860" end="01:01:51.140" style="s2">argument right you can&#39;t get it you</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.860" end="01:01:55.070" style="s2">can&#39;t get it doesn&#39;t make any sense and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.140" end="01:01:58.310" style="s2">so I think that aspirational normativity</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.070" end="01:02:00.350" style="s2">is exactly what we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.310" end="01:02:02.609" style="s2">come sensitive to again but again it</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.350" end="01:02:06.509" style="s2">can&#39;t be separable from</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.609" end="01:02:10.200" style="s2">chan ality can&#39;t be right something that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.509" end="01:02:13.259" style="s2">is proceeding without a concern for our</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.200" end="01:02:14.940" style="s2">proclivities - self-deception yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.259" end="01:02:16.950" style="s2">gonna say one of the pitfalls on that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.940" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned about like trying about</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.950" end="01:02:20.249" style="s2">faith because you talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:21.809" style="s2">faith which is just like a blind I know</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.249" end="01:02:24.509" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be okay and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.809" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">maladaptive talked about like nostalgic</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.509" end="01:02:29.009" style="s2">faith maladaptive but one of the ones</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:30.210" style="s2">that that was most interesting to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.009" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">that you were concerned about was this</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.210" end="01:02:34.650" style="s2">like utopian yes form of faith and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:36.089" style="s2">think like especially when we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.650" end="01:02:37.890" style="s2">conversation right now where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.089" end="01:02:39.720" style="s2">talking about like maybe there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.890" end="01:02:41.099" style="s2">attractor emerging or like a new calling</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.720" end="01:02:44.519" style="s2">we need to shift towards a different</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.099" end="01:02:48.710" style="s2">kind of future like how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.519" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">that we&#39;re avoiding that pitfall of</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.710" end="01:02:54.390" style="s2">having some kind of utopian faith like</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:56.519" style="s2">we feel like like we know what what</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.390" end="01:02:57.420" style="s2">needs to happen yeah don&#39;t say you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.519" end="01:03:00.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.420" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">I mean so part of that is to don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.660" end="01:03:08.009" style="s2">you know what the utopia is instead say</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:10.140" style="s2">that you know how to belong to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.009" end="01:03:13.529" style="s2">course of its emergence you take Athey</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.140" end="01:03:17.460" style="s2">animus approach to it you you can at you</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.529" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">at most participate warm data finesse in</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.460" end="01:03:23.279" style="s2">its emergence you are not the author of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:24.809" style="s2">it nor are you the revolutionary who</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.279" end="01:03:27.390" style="s2">knows how it should be and who should to</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.809" end="01:03:31.619" style="s2">be killed in order so that we get there</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.390" end="01:03:35.549" style="s2">you it does not belong to you you belong</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.619" end="01:03:39.180" style="s2">to it that&#39;s the difference do you feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.549" end="01:03:42.660" style="s2">like an important part of like knowing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:44.609" style="s2">how to be part of it and and flowing</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.660" end="01:03:46.470" style="s2">with it is identifying it or do you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.609" end="01:03:49.589" style="s2">think that identifying what I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.470" end="01:03:51.259" style="s2">trying to identify know here let me try</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.589" end="01:03:53.549" style="s2">it a different way</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.259" end="01:03:56.609" style="s2">utopia&#39;s so I&#39;m going to use Keeks</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.549" end="01:04:00.239" style="s2">instinct in between a goal and an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.609" end="01:04:02.039" style="s2">a goal is an ants is an end state that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.239" end="01:04:04.619" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get to that will be the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.039" end="01:04:08.130" style="s2">resolution of your problem right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.619" end="01:04:09.749" style="s2">very much a having mode thing and we</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.130" end="01:04:12.779" style="s2">have to have goals you guys know of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.749" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">course all of us right now I I talked</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.779" end="01:04:16.350" style="s2">about that okay the Keeks talks about</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:19.110" style="s2">and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.350" end="01:04:22.470" style="s2">shifted use of this word too he talks</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.110" end="01:04:23.880" style="s2">about an ideal like honesty honesty</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.470" end="01:04:25.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t the goal state you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.880" end="01:04:28.770" style="s2">get it to you don&#39;t get to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.620" end="01:04:31.890" style="s2">ever get to say well you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.770" end="01:04:35.490" style="s2">May 4th 2020 I&#39;d finally achieved</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.890" end="01:04:37.410" style="s2">honesty hey I don&#39;t need honesty anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.490" end="01:04:39.180" style="s2">I&#39;m done with it I&#39;ve moved beyond it</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.410" end="01:04:41.460" style="s2">there&#39;s no right I&#39;ve satisfied it</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.180" end="01:04:45.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not what honesty is honesty isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.460" end="01:04:47.010" style="s2">a state you get to it is adverbial it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.150" end="01:04:49.950" style="s2">that verbal is it is a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.010" end="01:04:53.160" style="s2">modification of how you are always</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.950" end="01:04:55.350" style="s2">developing always developing wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.160" end="01:04:58.560" style="s2">right like that to you if you ever say</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.350" end="01:05:00.800" style="s2">well Jeff I&#39;m wise now done you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.560" end="01:05:03.660" style="s2">totally misunderstood what wisdom is and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.800" end="01:05:06.450" style="s2">so the faith I&#39;m talking about is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.660" end="01:05:08.460" style="s2">new topic because utopias say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.450" end="01:05:11.790" style="s2">description of the goal state and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.460" end="01:05:14.010" style="s2">here is the algorithmic method that gets</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.790" end="01:05:16.830" style="s2">us to that goal state that will be</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.010" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">somehow the cumulation the resting point</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.830" end="01:05:21.710" style="s2">the final solution and I use that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:23.940" style="s2">deliberately to all of our problems</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.710" end="01:05:25.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.940" end="01:05:28.290" style="s2">and I Jordan doesn&#39;t mean that by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.710" end="01:05:30.210" style="s2">attractor he doesn&#39;t mean thus he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.290" end="01:05:32.100" style="s2">talking about metastability he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.210" end="01:05:34.950" style="s2">about the way the system can constantly</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.100" end="01:05:37.380" style="s2">adaptively reconfigure itself to have</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.160" end="01:05:45.030" style="s2">will need to shift again just like</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.630" end="01:05:47.810" style="s2">relevance realization I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.030" end="01:05:50.730" style="s2">a faith of relevance realization not</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.810" end="01:05:53.310" style="s2">propositional assertion there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.730" end="01:05:55.170" style="s2">multiple things that hit me on that it</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.310" end="01:05:57.300" style="s2">seems like the problem might be actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.170" end="01:05:59.730" style="s2">propositional assertion and that the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.300" end="01:06:02.070" style="s2">the low if you can inhabit the lower</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.730" end="01:06:03.540" style="s2">layers then you might be kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.070" end="01:06:05.130" style="s2">little bit more on the right track than</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.540" end="01:06:07.260" style="s2">if you try to necessarily put it into</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.130" end="01:06:08.460" style="s2">words and the other thing that hit me is</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.260" end="01:06:10.770" style="s2">that that it reminds me of like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.460" end="01:06:12.120" style="s2">Platonic ideal or even like a like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.770" end="01:06:14.340" style="s2">yoga posture right like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.120" end="01:06:16.080" style="s2">idea of something perfect that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.340" end="01:06:17.250" style="s2">heading towards but we we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.080" end="01:06:19.140" style="s2">never gonna get there we&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.250" end="01:06:21.360" style="s2">become closer and closer and closer to</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.140" end="01:06:22.860" style="s2">it does that does that land well though</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.360" end="01:06:24.570" style="s2">I like the first thing I want to push</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.860" end="01:06:26.520" style="s2">back on the second the first one is</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.570" end="01:06:27.120" style="s2">really good right but I think another</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.520" end="01:06:29.690" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.120" end="01:06:31.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s concer chling back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.690" end="01:06:33.020" style="s2">we are drawn to myth the poetic language</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.250" end="01:06:37.820" style="s2">is it to use korbin sturm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.020" end="01:06:40.160" style="s2">inherently imaginal its gestural and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.820" end="01:06:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it so it&#39;s enacted symbolism and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.160" end="01:06:44.380" style="s2">and why that&#39;s important is gestural</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.560" end="01:06:46.850" style="s2">imaginal thinking bridges between</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.380" end="01:06:49.250" style="s2">propositional and non propositional</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.850" end="01:06:51.320" style="s2">cognition part of the reason why we turn</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.250" end="01:06:54.200" style="s2">into mythopoetic ways of thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.320" end="01:06:57.140" style="s2">because we can simultaneously engage you</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.200" end="01:06:59.150" style="s2">know propositional and propositional or</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.140" end="01:07:01.310" style="s2">non propositional I prefer to say forms</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.150" end="01:07:03.080" style="s2">of knowing and being and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.310" end="01:07:05.570" style="s2">that comes up so I think yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.080" end="01:07:08.060" style="s2">that that is that&#39;s right now the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.570" end="01:07:09.290" style="s2">problem with with the problem we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.060" end="01:07:11.060" style="s2">with our history with mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.290" end="01:07:13.640" style="s2">discourses we&#39;ve literal eyes it and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.060" end="01:07:16.040" style="s2">fundamental eyes it and then we remove</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.640" end="01:07:17.420" style="s2">it from actually being embedded in all</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.040" end="01:07:20.240" style="s2">the non propositional stuff and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.420" end="01:07:22.430" style="s2">actually lose that the the religio the</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.240" end="01:07:23.930" style="s2">connectedness and our faith just becomes</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.430" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">the assertion of proposition so I agree</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.930" end="01:07:28.700" style="s2">with the first one I&#39;m not sure sure I</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:31.760" style="s2">agree with the second one because I I</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.700" end="01:07:33.800" style="s2">don&#39;t even like the idea of like well I</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:36.380" style="s2">know what it looks like I just admit</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.800" end="01:07:38.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll never get there um you see cuz you</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.380" end="01:07:41.330" style="s2">think about think about phyleus Ohia</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.450" end="01:07:44.840" style="s2">what Socrates offered he&#39;s he claimed</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.330" end="01:07:46.820" style="s2">that we could never be gods we can never</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.840" end="01:07:49.310" style="s2">write and we could never be gods so we</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.820" end="01:07:51.170" style="s2">could never be wise because only the the</p>

<p begin="01:07:56.180" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">relevant too because you know the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.500" end="01:08:00.740" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff you start talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:02.600" style="s2">about gods and things like that the</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.420" end="01:08:27.560" style="s2">makes me think of something that we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.400" end="01:08:28.670" style="s2">all kind of wandering listening to some</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.560" end="01:08:30.740" style="s2">of your range of recent interviews</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.670" end="01:08:32.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve said a couple times that if if</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.740" end="01:08:34.010" style="s2">push came to shove your principles are</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.840" end="01:08:36.980" style="s2">more important than your own survival</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.010" end="01:08:38.840" style="s2">yeah and that you would choose your</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.980" end="01:08:40.460" style="s2">principles over your survival so we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.840" end="01:08:43.220" style="s2">kind of wondering like which principles</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.460" end="01:08:43.580" style="s2">you had in mind or how you might see</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.220" end="01:08:46.220" style="s2">them come</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.580" end="01:08:52.010" style="s2">into conflict contact I won&#39;t live a</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.220" end="01:08:54.850" style="s2">life of fear so there&#39;s this is another</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.010" end="01:08:58.220" style="s2">there&#39;s you know you&#39;re sunk cost and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.850" end="01:09:00.530" style="s2">our arguments that I&#39;m more themselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.220" end="01:09:02.510" style="s2">from plausibility which is like you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.530" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">I take precautions I&#39;m doing everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.510" end="01:09:05.120" style="s2">that I&#39;m being asked to do right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.480" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s socially</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.120" end="01:09:10.070" style="s2">responsible but you know it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.480" end="01:09:12.109" style="s2">if it gets said well I just can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.070" end="01:09:13.880" style="s2">know because if you do this then you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.109" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">might get sick and then you might die</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.880" end="01:09:19.250" style="s2">and death is like you know just this the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:21.140" style="s2">the infinite negative and therefore even</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.250" end="01:09:22.970" style="s2">if all if that chain of events is so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.140" end="01:09:25.460" style="s2">improbable you matter the most</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.970" end="01:09:29.150" style="s2">nevertheless right under and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.460" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">gonna live a life of fear like that at</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.150" end="01:09:34.460" style="s2">some point right if it&#39;s gonna if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:37.790" style="s2">gonna be well that it is in order to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.460" end="01:09:40.370" style="s2">survive I have to be humanized myself to</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.790" end="01:09:42.980" style="s2">a significant degree and live you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.370" end="01:09:45.890" style="s2">in constant fear because of this you</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.980" end="01:09:47.500" style="s2">know nebulous threat and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.890" end="01:09:49.700" style="s2">and increasingly put potentially</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.500" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">authoritarian state trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.700" end="01:09:52.910" style="s2">it at some point it&#39;s like no I just</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:54.890" style="s2">don&#39;t want to live that way that&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.920" end="01:10:07.160" style="s2">matters you&#39;re younger I get it so I get</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.160" end="01:10:09.980" style="s2">that okay but at some point my survival</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.160" end="01:10:14.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean as much to me as the kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.980" end="01:10:17.720" style="s2">of life I want to live and so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.180" end="01:10:20.480" style="s2">the principles that make you know a life</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.720" end="01:10:21.650" style="s2">of of just fear a life I don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.650" end="01:10:30.800" style="s2">cower a life in which the capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.020" end="01:10:34.700" style="s2">doing philosophy a-- for examining the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.800" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living we</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.700" end="01:10:38.600" style="s2">get to a place where we&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:43.880" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.600" end="01:10:45.740" style="s2">but I made a deliberate effort what I</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.880" end="01:10:48.020" style="s2">saw especially how many people are</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.740" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">spinning off into a kind of historic</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.020" end="01:10:54.620" style="s2">hysterical kind of fear i sat down and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:57.050" style="s2">thought you know where would how far you</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.620" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">how far would you go towards ignoring a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.050" end="01:10:58.699" style="s2">threat</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:01.400" style="s2">of course irrational that&#39;s rational</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.699" end="01:11:03.530" style="s2">irresponsible how far would you go</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.400" end="01:11:06.590" style="s2">though how far would you go and so I</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.530" end="01:11:09.650" style="s2">sort of made in my mind I came to a</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.590" end="01:11:13.699" style="s2">decision no any of those things that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.650" end="01:11:16.730" style="s2">would rob me of the Socratic way of life</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.699" end="01:11:20.510" style="s2">and dehumanized me into being a coward</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.730" end="01:11:24.739" style="s2">and being bound to just the having mode</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.510" end="01:11:31.580" style="s2">and maintaining my survival I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.739" end="01:11:33.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want that I don&#39;t yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.580" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">definitely resonate with that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.140" end="01:11:35.989" style="s2">really interesting and it actually kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:37.880" style="s2">of sparked a bit of an insight for me</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.989" end="01:11:38.780" style="s2">about some of the social isolation like</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.880" end="01:11:40.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a lot of debate with our</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.780" end="01:11:41.420" style="s2">friends about whether to socially</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.100" end="01:11:44.060" style="s2">isolate it all and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.420" end="01:11:44.930" style="s2">and it makes me think like maybe think</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.060" end="01:11:46.219" style="s2">of what we were talking about in your</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.930" end="01:11:47.690" style="s2">class where you were saying talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.219" end="01:11:49.699" style="s2">about like the golden mean when it came</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.690" end="01:11:50.989" style="s2">to virtues you know it&#39;s not just being</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.699" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">in the middle but it&#39;s like being at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.989" end="01:11:55.969" style="s2">right point at the right time yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:11:57.710" style="s2">exactly exactly and Jordan Hall and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.969" end="01:11:59.900" style="s2">talked about that the faith is about</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.710" end="01:12:01.640" style="s2">that finesse about you know because</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.900" end="01:12:03.080" style="s2">we&#39;re constructing virtual engines on</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.640" end="01:12:05.090" style="s2">the fly here because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.080" end="01:12:07.910" style="s2">find the right set of conditions that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.090" end="01:12:09.620" style="s2">will get us on course right and that he</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.910" end="01:12:12.230" style="s2">talked about both tannic and anti-panic</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.620" end="01:12:14.120" style="s2">and how we have to steer between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.230" end="01:12:16.640" style="s2">skill and Charybdis of panic and anti</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.120" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">panic and that&#39;s very much like you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.640" end="01:12:19.730" style="s2">some of the other points we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:22.370" style="s2">about like Franklin&#39;s notion about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.730" end="01:12:24.290" style="s2">people who you know who lose the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.370" end="01:12:26.590" style="s2">connection to the logos he called his</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.290" end="01:12:28.850" style="s2">therapy logo therapy for a reason</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.590" end="01:12:30.770" style="s2">you know and the people who just give up</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.850" end="01:12:32.390" style="s2">in despair they lose the connection to</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.770" end="01:12:34.880" style="s2">the logos or the people who just you</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.390" end="01:12:36.410" style="s2">topically assert we will be rescued on</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.880" end="01:12:38.840" style="s2">this day and I know it for sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.410" end="01:12:42.230" style="s2">we have to we have to we have to sneer</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.840" end="01:12:45.170" style="s2">between pain anti-panic yeah reminds me</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.230" end="01:12:47.180" style="s2">of like the discussion on flow states</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.170" end="01:12:48.140" style="s2">where you know you have like - you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.180" end="01:12:49.760" style="s2">like kind of boredom and you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.140" end="01:12:52.550" style="s2">anxiety and you have to kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.760" end="01:12:53.630" style="s2">exactly follow this channel and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.550" end="01:12:55.820" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the correct way to do faith</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.630" end="01:12:58.430" style="s2">yes this makes me want to bring up</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.820" end="01:12:59.690" style="s2">another potential level for myth - when</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.430" end="01:13:01.790" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about faith because you</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.690" end="01:13:03.710" style="s2">said like maybe people go back to these</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.790" end="01:13:05.480" style="s2">myths because they&#39;ve survived many</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.710" end="01:13:08.300" style="s2">transit and transition so maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.480" end="01:13:11.090" style="s2">most likely to survive but also I was</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.300" end="01:13:13.760" style="s2">thinking that a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.090" end="01:13:15.980" style="s2">powerful myths like I&#39;m thinking Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.760" end="01:13:18.559" style="s2">in particular because hold to call it a</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.980" end="01:13:21.770" style="s2">myth but like a lot of these myths are</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.559" end="01:13:24.170" style="s2">about a moment where somebody finessed</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.770" end="01:13:26.829" style="s2">and rode that wave into the new</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.170" end="01:13:30.159" style="s2">attractor and like it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.829" end="01:13:33.829" style="s2">story that in a way could show us a</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.159" end="01:13:35.809" style="s2">model for how do they do they deal I</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.829" end="01:13:37.340" style="s2">don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think mr. bad term I</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.809" end="01:13:40.070" style="s2">don&#39;t regard it as a pejorative term in</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.340" end="01:13:41.840" style="s2">all Katie and I mean in Plato in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.070" end="01:13:44.929" style="s2">seventh letter makes it clear that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.840" end="01:13:47.510" style="s2">mythologized Socrates he says I&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.929" end="01:13:49.760" style="s2">him more beautiful and he doesn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.510" end="01:13:51.860" style="s2">he&#39;s doing anything duplicitous or</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.760" end="01:13:54.770" style="s2">dishonest in doing that he thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.860" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing is putting Socrates in</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.770" end="01:13:59.690" style="s2">the form that will allow him to become</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:01.670" style="s2">mythic in the sense we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.690" end="01:14:05.510" style="s2">here transferable to multiple situations</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.670" end="01:14:07.460" style="s2">and multiple contexts and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.510" end="01:14:09.469" style="s2">though I think that&#39;s exactly right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.460" end="01:14:11.900" style="s2">this is what I mean the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.469" end="01:14:15.980" style="s2">like many people are people that we just</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.900" end="01:14:18.559" style="s2">went through Easter right and a culture</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.980" end="01:14:20.599" style="s2">you know we&#39;re very illiterate about a</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.559" end="01:14:22.940" style="s2">lot of these myths were illiterate about</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.599" end="01:14:25.039" style="s2">them that&#39;s why I mean what I said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.940" end="01:14:26.300" style="s2">sort of religiously and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.039" end="01:14:28.520" style="s2">just aren&#39;t the Christian myths where</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.300" end="01:14:32.809" style="s2">we&#39;re literate about a lot of the myths</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.520" end="01:14:34.550" style="s2">other Axial Age myths how many people</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.809" end="01:14:37.699" style="s2">know all the mythology around Siddhartha</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.550" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">a Gotama or Socrates right and I got</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.699" end="01:14:40.639" style="s2">into a great discussion about race Kelly</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.199" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">with this about how we need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.639" end="01:14:45.440" style="s2">reintegrate the hero with the sage in</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:47.659" style="s2">our mythology we should need to look for</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.440" end="01:14:50.030" style="s2">the sage hero myths rather than just the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.659" end="01:14:52.369" style="s2">hero myths the problem with the hero</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.030" end="01:14:55.520" style="s2">myth is this is why I&#39;m critical of you</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.369" end="01:14:57.199" style="s2">know some of joseph campbell in jordan</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.520" end="01:14:58.610" style="s2">peterson and then Rafe sort of pushed</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.199" end="01:15:00.949" style="s2">back on me but then he acknowledged that</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.610" end="01:15:02.539" style="s2">I was kind of right so it was a really</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.949" end="01:15:05.900" style="s2">good giving back and forth between us</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.539" end="01:15:08.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not his channel is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.900" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">the hero myth has become very much in</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.150" end="01:15:14.809" style="s2">our culture has become very much reduced</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:18.079" style="s2">to the warrior meth and the the and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.809" end="01:15:20.630" style="s2">hero is all yang and no Yin and so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.079" end="01:15:23.179" style="s2">mythologies and and we forget that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.630" end="01:15:25.090" style="s2">the take a look at the Greek myths for</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.179" end="01:15:29.290" style="s2">every hero myth there&#39;s a hubris myth</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.090" end="01:15:33.130" style="s2">for every Theseus there is an Icarus</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.290" end="01:15:34.750" style="s2">right telling us wait wait you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.130" end="01:15:36.340" style="s2">conquer everything and don&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.750" end="01:15:38.590" style="s2">count conquer the domain of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.340" end="01:15:40.540" style="s2">because then you&#39;re going to fall to</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.590" end="01:15:43.780" style="s2">earth or like Faden you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.540" end="01:15:45.640" style="s2">struck down by Zeus or like Arachne</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.780" end="01:15:49.900" style="s2">Athena the goddess of wisdom is going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.640" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">turn you into a spider so I think we</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.900" end="01:15:54.430" style="s2">forgotten all the hubris myths we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:56.410" style="s2">isolated the hero myths and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.430" end="01:15:59.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve identified the hero with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.410" end="01:16:02.470" style="s2">warrior so I&#39;m kind of very hesitant</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.170" end="01:16:06.130" style="s2">around all the hero mythology and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.470" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">think we if we go back to we integrating</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.130" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">the hero with the sage the heroic sage</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:14.290" style="s2">like Jesus like Siddhartha like Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:15.400" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a much better choice for</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.290" end="01:16:17.170" style="s2">us going for it but that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.400" end="01:16:18.670" style="s2">about you have to reflect on this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.170" end="01:16:20.980" style="s2">you have to you have to you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.670" end="01:16:24.210" style="s2">educated in it just because a myth comes</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.980" end="01:16:26.680" style="s2">up doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.210" end="01:16:27.850" style="s2">so we&#39;re I think we have maybe about six</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.680" end="01:16:29.320" style="s2">minutes left should we do one more</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.850" end="01:16:31.240" style="s2">question or should we just um like</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.320" end="01:16:32.350" style="s2">closing closing remarks well why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.240" end="01:16:35.860" style="s2">you ask your question Chris we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.350" end="01:16:37.630" style="s2">moved time for more okay so so John I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.860" end="01:16:38.020" style="s2">heard a lot of talk about digital tamp</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.630" end="01:16:42.120" style="s2">fryers</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.020" end="01:16:49.240" style="s2">recently and how how zoom is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.120" end="01:16:52.180" style="s2">reviving the the campfire red wines need</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.240" end="01:16:55.960" style="s2">to Bret sort of talked about it Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.180" end="01:16:57.790" style="s2">mentioned it to me then I was so it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.960" end="01:16:59.410" style="s2">sort of a it&#39;s been a distributed thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.790" end="01:17:00.970" style="s2">that sort of generated right yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.410" end="01:17:02.740" style="s2">definitely represent that you would that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.970" end="01:17:04.830" style="s2">you would discuss it I was I was just</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.740" end="01:17:08.230" style="s2">wondering um so what is special about</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.830" end="01:17:09.970" style="s2">campfires and and it is it is it tell is</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.230" end="01:17:12.790" style="s2">it the telling of stories is it the deal</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.970" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">logos and and do you think that that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.790" end="01:17:18.880" style="s2">might see a revival of collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:20.590" style="s2">consciousness due to us all doing this</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.880" end="01:17:22.900" style="s2">this digital campfire thing no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.590" end="01:17:26.160" style="s2">good so notice that how guys done start</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.900" end="01:17:28.510" style="s2">named his practice he called it circling</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.160" end="01:17:32.110" style="s2">circle around the logo stand the locus</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.510" end="01:17:33.640" style="s2">is like a fire right and that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.110" end="01:17:36.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the metaphor that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.640" end="01:17:38.860" style="s2">and guys actually explicitly uses that</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.640" end="01:17:41.770" style="s2">at times and what we used to have any</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.860" end="01:17:44.199" style="s2">fire is we used a circle and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.770" end="01:17:46.750" style="s2">really important notice that we we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.199" end="01:17:48.760" style="s2">in a platonic circle here what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.750" end="01:17:51.070" style="s2">that is as an abstract circle we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.760" end="01:17:53.290" style="s2">actually located in space with respect</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.070" end="01:17:57.670" style="s2">to each other so we can&#39;t use space to</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.290" end="01:17:59.380" style="s2">mark out status we can&#39;t we&#39;re like in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.670" end="01:18:01.719" style="s2">campfire we&#39;re circled and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.380" end="01:18:04.119" style="s2">glowing and the center shifts because</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.719" end="01:18:07.060" style="s2">the zoom will shift right who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.119" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">screen right and it so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.060" end="01:18:11.260" style="s2">campfire and so we&#39;re focused on each</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:13.030" style="s2">other but we&#39;re also focused on this</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.260" end="01:18:15.340" style="s2">shared space that&#39;s constantly like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.030" end="01:18:17.199" style="s2">fire changing in front and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.340" end="01:18:19.989" style="s2">literally glowing because it&#39;s lighted</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.199" end="01:18:22.239" style="s2">and notice how our faces are to each</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.989" end="01:18:25.030" style="s2">other if you&#39;re faced with this large on</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:26.710" style="s2">my visual on my retina you&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.030" end="01:18:29.469" style="s2">close to me in person in a way that was</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.710" end="01:18:31.510" style="s2">socially uncomfortable but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.469" end="01:18:34.179" style="s2">matter in this medium the grammar is</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.510" end="01:18:36.090" style="s2">different we&#39;re allowed to have this</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.179" end="01:18:38.380" style="s2">proximity to each other without</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.090" end="01:18:42.190" style="s2">trespassing on all kinds of social</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.380" end="01:18:44.949" style="s2">niceties so we have these lit and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.190" end="01:18:45.969" style="s2">most of the person is actually excluded</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.949" end="01:18:47.830" style="s2">from our vision like when we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.969" end="01:18:50.380" style="s2">around a campfire and the people have</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.830" end="01:18:53.080" style="s2">their lit face but most of most of us as</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.380" end="01:18:57.159" style="s2">in darkness and we&#39;re like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.080" end="01:19:01.000" style="s2">much like the the that feeling of you</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.159" end="01:19:03.420" style="s2">know intimacy that campfires give us and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.000" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2">that&#39;s of course because they also were</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.810" end="01:19:29.440" style="s2">talk and you zoom out to the face and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.260" end="01:19:32.050" style="s2">then you zoom in to yourself but on this</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:34.750" style="s2">meditating object the campfire then you</p>
