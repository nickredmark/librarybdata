<p begin="00:00:39.390" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">bought them secondhand and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">that you you source them ethically but</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">is that ethically they were probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">were made by slave labor but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">buy them firsthand and I&#39;ve had them I</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:10.549" style="s2">footprint was and what my slave</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">footprint was because I know I&#39;m more I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.549" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">give her things that I wouldn&#39;t buy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">myself I let her do things that are</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">just because as her parents I want her</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">to have ever experience in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">yeah I want you to have glitter to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">our projects with even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">horrible for them for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">every time like so I don&#39;t buy the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">glitter but if we&#39;re somewhere then</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">someone else sees right so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">not slavery that&#39;s environmental but to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">know how much is my kids right and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">much is mine and how much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">based on my annual consumption versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve had this you know my hiking boots</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">for a decade but I do have a pair of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">hiking boots like what is what is them</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">so your friend and you Eric I know you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">you take care of most of your own needs</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">by yourself and I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">curious to know what your slavery</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">footprint is but it wasn&#39;t working it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">wasn&#39;t working in the browsers that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">had so that is definitely part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">problem as well when this cool things</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">come up that are technology and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">they aren&#39;t maintained in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:13.039" style="s2">even when you do ask people to come and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.039" style="s2">take the test</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.080" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it in Chrome or Firefox</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">right it says it&#39;s like well download</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">one of these browsers and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:20.040" style="s2">downloaded Firefox to take it it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:21.540" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:23.070" style="s2">these are the kind of things that I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:25.950" style="s2">want to take operative for but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.070" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">getting into the metaphor can be and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.950" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">tech cooperative not actually the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">solution racing for slavery so even</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">though you guys don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">what your slavery footprint is I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">you both know a bit about the issue on</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">the planet with slavery and the areas</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">that it impacts and what you use like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:51.690" style="s2">don&#39;t use cosmetics I do use electronics</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">and way too many I&#39;m it&#39;s like how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.690" end="00:02:54.570" style="s2">laptops do you have well three because</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">two of them are partly broken and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.570" end="00:03:02.100" style="s2">third ones on its last leg and there</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">aren&#39;t the systems to be able to repair</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.100" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">it I don&#39;t have the power to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:07.740" style="s2"> ridiculous that my computer</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last more than two or three</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.740" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">years and that there is no option for</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">like Apple and Google to choose to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">ethical I call BS on that I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">sure of Google and Apple said we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:21.600" style="s2">gonna use your COBOL unless it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">ethically mind they have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.600" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">change that but we are the ones buying</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">their product and so we have the power</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">to change that but oh it&#39;s gonna add</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">video to the stream and hello Vinnie a</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:41.550" style="s2">discussing our own slavery footprint</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">were discussing that the the tool was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.550" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">little broken this morning so some of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">could or over the last week so we some</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:49.230" style="s2">of us could take it and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:50.580" style="s2">couldn&#39;t take it yeah seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.230" end="00:03:53.160" style="s2">little fragile depending on what browser</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.580" end="00:03:55.709" style="s2">people are using yeah I&#39;ve shot it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.160" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">chrome and in Firefox and it didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.709" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">either of them it said your browser</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t support and they said try</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">downloading crime on Chrome or Firefox</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:13.830" style="s2">so um we&#39;re on a tablet oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:14.910" style="s2">there are very opposed to it a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.830" end="00:04:16.019" style="s2">months back and I did it then and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.910" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any problems then but today</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.019" end="00:04:19.830" style="s2">when I tried to again cuz I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:21.390" style="s2">remember what my result was and so today</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.830" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">and also I remember there was something</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:25.490" style="s2">about it that bugged me that didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">like a fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.490" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:29.370" style="s2">of questions right but I can&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.900" end="00:04:30.450" style="s2">that was now I know I wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.370" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">that heart but I can&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.450" end="00:04:37.410" style="s2">was so unfortunately I&#39;m yeah well or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:39.630" style="s2">well I&#39;ve got the floor if I may just on</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.410" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">just on the notion of slavery because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">seems to me that slavery has been going</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">on for a very very very long time in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:47.940" style="s2">form or another one could even make an</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">argument that slavery has been the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.940" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">predominant relationship between you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:57.330" style="s2">know master and/or owner and-and-and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">worker kind of thing for time immemorial</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.330" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">and you know the heart of slavery is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">notion of coercion not having a choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">but to do what your masters are telling</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:08.220" style="s2">you to do and it seems to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s not just kids digging up COBOL</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.220" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">in the Congo it&#39;s pretty much everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">right you don&#39;t have a choice for most</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">people they are doing their boring</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:17.250" style="s2">shitty jobs or three jobs or whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:19.050" style="s2">make ends meet they don&#39;t have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.250" end="00:05:20.580" style="s2">but to go to those boring shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.050" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">you know there are lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.580" end="00:05:24.990" style="s2">people who would not be considered</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:26.040" style="s2">slaves at all right even in even by even</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.990" end="00:05:27.660" style="s2">you know even though some modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.040" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">slightly more abstract definition of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.660" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">slavery but they absolutely are and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:36.060" style="s2">you know that that coercive nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.060" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">having to go and do some shitty horrible</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.060" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">thing just because you need to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">enough money to pay the bills that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">slavery in my opinion also so yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">your own Irby - you&#39;re a slave but if</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:51.660" style="s2">the police bleeped you you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">employee mmm yeah exactly so I&#39;ve put a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.660" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">link to a video in the chat and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">show up in just a second which is a link</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.560" end="00:05:59.220" style="s2">to a video stefan molyneux made while</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">I&#39;m no fan of stefan molyneux however</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.220" end="00:06:03.390" style="s2">this particular video I think makes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">very very very strong point it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.390" end="00:06:07.710" style="s2">the story of your enslavement and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">and I think it makes a good point very</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.710" end="00:06:11.390" style="s2">strongly so I&#39;ll leave that for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">to watch if you want to at some point</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.390" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">yeah certainly the Romans were very big</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">on you know the idea that if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">earn your living by labour even if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:24.480" style="s2">were paid you were still essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:26.970" style="s2">slave but I mean the the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.480" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">are very sharp when you get to you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.970" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">um okay hell I say this exactly so for</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">me my background is kind of Scottish</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.630" end="00:06:38.820" style="s2">left-leaning labor activism that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.530" end="00:06:40.110" style="s2">kind of what I grew up in right I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.820" end="00:06:40.460" style="s2">never personally very active in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.110" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.460" end="00:06:44.660" style="s2">technical class but certainly my parents</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:49.370" style="s2">generation or earlier were Scottish</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.660" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">Union labor organizing types and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.370" end="00:06:54.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of there&#39;s a curve right</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:57.979" style="s2">like you know landowners who rent a one</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.919" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">end through unionized employees through</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.979" end="00:07:02.630" style="s2">non unionized employees and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:04.039" style="s2">know four or five gradations of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.630" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">until you get right down to slave</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.039" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">markets it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s on its a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">gradually diminishing human rights</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">framework like in China the technical</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:17.270" style="s2">class are working what we call nine</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:20.210" style="s2">ninety six which is twelve hour days six</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.270" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">days a week and they&#39;re quite anointed</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.210" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">by that they&#39;re not very happy anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:30.889" style="s2">Helen burrows who was the person that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:32.570" style="s2">designed slavery footprint and may join</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.889" end="00:07:34.099" style="s2">us so fingers crossed</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.570" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">kids have stuff to rearrange but she may</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.099" end="00:07:41.240" style="s2">pop up switch the conversation when she</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:42.889" style="s2">gets here this is a specific type of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:44.330" style="s2">conversation so for the next few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.889" end="00:07:45.800" style="s2">we&#39;re still talking about what slavery</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.330" end="00:07:47.419" style="s2">currently looks like in our own lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.800" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">and in the world and then we&#39;ll switch</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.419" end="00:07:52.759" style="s2">over to our visions of a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:53.770" style="s2">future for labor and slavery that does</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:07:55.849" style="s2">not include</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.770" end="00:07:58.159" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t include slavery</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.849" end="00:07:59.719" style="s2">hopefully I don&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.159" end="00:08:03.949" style="s2">beautiful version of the future include</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.719" end="00:08:05.479" style="s2">slavery that would be because if you if</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.949" end="00:08:07.099" style="s2">you take it if you stripped it right you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.479" end="00:08:09.650" style="s2">know based on the definition I was sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.099" end="00:08:12.770" style="s2">of trying to articulate before then in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.650" end="00:08:14.509" style="s2">sense we are all inevitably slaves to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.770" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">the demands of nature right I mean know</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.509" end="00:08:20.449" style="s2">that that&#39;s in a way in a way but but of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:21.500" style="s2">course yeah I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.449" end="00:08:24.320" style="s2">what do you guys think about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.500" end="00:08:25.789" style="s2">because that feels quite true in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.320" end="00:08:27.889" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.789" end="00:08:29.570" style="s2">to me like I&#39;m a slave to my body and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.889" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">the things it does to me like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.570" end="00:08:32.870" style="s2">certain I don&#39;t have a choice and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:34.849" style="s2">can&#39;t emancipate myself from it and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.870" end="00:08:36.680" style="s2">can&#39;t but there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.849" end="00:08:38.270" style="s2">different about that and there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.680" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no one to blame there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.270" end="00:08:43.099" style="s2">to do about that versus if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:44.779" style="s2">sells my child if somebody if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.099" end="00:08:47.779" style="s2">responsible for selling someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.779" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">child there&#39;s a big difference there but</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.779" end="00:08:52.970" style="s2">you we are all biological ecological</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">beans and we have to work within that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.970" end="00:08:56.870" style="s2">framework I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:09:03.530" style="s2">slavery I think that&#39;s more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.870" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">constraint yeah I mean there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.530" end="00:09:09.800" style="s2">say this exactly so there are a number</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:12.740" style="s2">of gradations inside of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.800" end="00:09:16.930" style="s2">slavery right so if you get right down</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.740" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">to this kind of range where you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.930" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2">agricultural workers gradually fading</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">through two bonded labor you know very</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.300" end="00:09:28.670" style="s2">poor peasant farmers sharecroppers</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:30.050" style="s2">sharecroppers that oh they&#39;re landowner</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:33.260" style="s2">a ton of money and aren&#39;t free to leave</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">the land actual bonded labor and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.260" end="00:09:38.030" style="s2">you know two notches below about you got</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.500" style="s2">outright slavery you know that are that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.030" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">are a lot of these kind of shades of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.500" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">grey right if you&#39;re an investment</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:46.130" style="s2">banker yeah are you enslaved well you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:47.150" style="s2">know you&#39;re 24 years old you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.130" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">a nine hour week</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.150" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">your boss has absolute power over your</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.070" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">life and you&#39;re doing it because of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:57.350" style="s2">hope of a future reward are you enslaved</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">to your own ambition and so to me the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">distinguishing factors are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.540" style="s2">necessarily the coercion but the quality</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.220" end="00:10:04.450" style="s2">of life enjoyed by the people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:06.980" style="s2">coerced</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.450" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">well that would buy that argument then</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.980" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">brave new world is an acceptable form of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:12.050" style="s2">slavery right because everybody&#39;s happy</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:13.340" style="s2">in brave new world right everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.050" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">their place and I&#39;m happy doing what</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.340" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and and so this is my</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">world with such a marvelous distinct</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.090" end="00:10:33.740" style="s2">sorry please I was going to say like as</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.220" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">a single mom on disability like I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.740" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">had more money to be able to make better</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:40.220" style="s2">ethical decisions on what I could</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:43.220" style="s2">purchase but there&#39;s a certain thing I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.220" end="00:10:45.830" style="s2">cannot do when I am a single individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.220" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">like there&#39;s I can&#39;t change the entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.830" end="00:10:49.190" style="s2">computer market I can&#39;t even change</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:50.960" style="s2">really my food system because I have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.190" end="00:10:53.660" style="s2">get what&#39;s available to be able to feed</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.960" end="00:10:56.150" style="s2">me and my family for cheaper amounts and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.660" end="00:10:58.460" style="s2">and I care about it forget about all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.150" end="00:11:00.140" style="s2">people who feel like they&#39;re enslaved by</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.460" end="00:11:02.450" style="s2">working for Walmart or working for</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.140" end="00:11:05.840" style="s2">people or who or you know Amazon or</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.940" end="00:11:09.340" style="s2">can&#39;t make ends meet and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.200" end="00:11:13.870" style="s2">certain quality that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.340" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">difference between a living wage and can</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.870" end="00:11:18.070" style="s2">you afford shelter and food with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:19.570" style="s2">amount you&#39;re paying someone because</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.070" end="00:11:21.460" style="s2">it&#39;s not considered slavery if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.570" end="00:11:24.550" style="s2">below that and it can be below that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.460" end="00:11:28.570" style="s2">that is passed on to everybody else but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.550" end="00:11:30.340" style="s2">that is slavery like that is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.570" end="00:11:31.660" style="s2">the owning of a person they have some</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.340" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">amount of choice and where they do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.660" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">but do they and and being able to figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:38.230" style="s2">out what we can do together so that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.880" style="s2">can have more impact with the dollars I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.230" end="00:11:41.530" style="s2">do have instead of like the the enders</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.020" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">third or fourth edition of the phone and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.720" end="00:12:19.260" style="s2">they basically did everything possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">to get an ethically manufactured film um</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.260" end="00:12:24.340" style="s2">so they you know sourced as far as he</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:25.570" style="s2">could down the component line they you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.340" end="00:12:27.330" style="s2">know did a bunch of work to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.570" end="00:12:31.410" style="s2">there were no conflict minerals in there</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.330" end="00:12:34.780" style="s2">and you know they got pretty close</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.410" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">really pretty close the phone was also</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.780" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">designed for upgradability so you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">cool the camera module and put in better</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">cameras their various other components</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:47.770" style="s2">that you could do is made to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:50.100" style="s2">repairable and they&#39;re maybe 50% more</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.770" end="00:12:52.950" style="s2">expensive than an equivalent a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.100" end="00:12:55.450" style="s2">conventional manufacturer phone and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.950" end="00:12:57.580" style="s2">things that sounds right that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.450" end="00:12:58.780" style="s2">great yeah it&#39;s quite a successful</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.580" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">project they&#39;ve been going about ten</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.780" end="00:13:04.660" style="s2">years throughout the Netherlands I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:07.570" style="s2">own one I have some standard Android</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.660" end="00:13:09.610" style="s2">device but it&#39;s kind of you know it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.570" end="00:13:10.960" style="s2">shows what can be done and it also shows</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.610" end="00:13:13.690" style="s2">how much of this is driven by consumer</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.960" end="00:13:15.970" style="s2">interests like if fairphone had sold a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.690" end="00:13:18.790" style="s2">hundred times as many phones as they</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.970" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">sold in all probability they would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.790" end="00:13:23.890" style="s2">been now been done a lot for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">and so it&#39;s quite interesting that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.890" end="00:13:30.279" style="s2">kind of you know it exists and they did</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:32.350" style="s2">okay but they didn&#39;t do phenomenally and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.279" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">as a result you know there&#39;ll be another</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.350" end="00:13:36.130" style="s2">version of fairphone but there won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:38.649" style="s2">necessarily be fair TV fair walk top</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:40.510" style="s2">fare bike yeah but the other thing is as</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.649" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">well I mean if they had sold a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.510" end="00:13:45.130" style="s2">times as many units as they&#39;d sold then</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">it actually starts to have an impact on</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.130" end="00:13:49.750" style="s2">the supply chain at large right because</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">they&#39;re selling their phones for more</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:52.390" style="s2">money they can provide protective</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:54.070" style="s2">equipment and decent wages for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.390" end="00:13:55.240" style="s2">people who are mining the dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.070" end="00:13:56.860" style="s2">chemicals you&#39;re not really because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.240" end="00:13:58.209" style="s2">know I mean you&#39;d find people who&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.860" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">perfectly happy to mind them you know I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.209" end="00:14:02.260" style="s2">mean in a non slave way give me</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">protection gear pay me a decent wage</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.260" end="00:14:08.170" style="s2">don&#39;t make me work 16 hours a day no</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:10.269" style="s2">problem yeah observe absolutely and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.170" end="00:14:12.850" style="s2">mean that that was that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.269" end="00:14:16.089" style="s2">negotiation that the white working-class</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.850" end="00:14:18.279" style="s2">has gone through right I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.089" end="00:14:20.290" style="s2">summary right all my think all my name</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.279" end="00:14:22.360" style="s2">right you know coal mining used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.290" end="00:14:24.459" style="s2">joke brutal life expectancy of like 35</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.360" end="00:14:28.360" style="s2">or something like that and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.459" end="00:14:29.829" style="s2">safer than being a roofer so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.360" end="00:14:31.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not that these labor disputes are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.829" end="00:14:34.630" style="s2">only along you know racial ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.959" end="00:14:36.430" style="s2">slavery lines you know all of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.630" end="00:14:38.110" style="s2">was labor disputes inside Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.430" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">society until literally the day before</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.110" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">yesterday but then of course what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:43.930" style="s2">happens is it&#39;s now much more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.010" end="00:14:45.370" style="s2">to provide the safety equipment and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.930" end="00:14:47.500" style="s2">working conditions on the wages and oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.370" end="00:14:49.149" style="s2">and then so whenever it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.500" end="00:14:50.350" style="s2">do so this gets outsourced to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.149" end="00:14:51.670" style="s2">places where you don&#39;t have to you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.350" end="00:14:53.950" style="s2">not constrained by those standards</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.670" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">anymore right and so it&#39;s it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.950" end="00:14:57.220" style="s2">becomes ineffective you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:14:59.800" style="s2">have this when you have this global</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.220" end="00:15:02.350" style="s2">supply chain it becomes ineffective the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:04.449" style="s2">regulations in one country or not are</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.350" end="00:15:06.430" style="s2">not applicable elsewhere you know and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.449" end="00:15:07.959" style="s2">until I mean this is maybe something we</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.430" end="00:15:09.399" style="s2">can in fact it&#39;s time to start moving on</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.959" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">to that now right this is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.399" end="00:15:18.550" style="s2">is something that if standards of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">and safety and worker well-being and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.550" end="00:15:25.810" style="s2">on were standardized right that would</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">mean a it would make a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.810" end="00:15:29.170" style="s2">in the cut in the outlawed cost of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.540" style="s2">products and we as consumers would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.170" end="00:15:33.690" style="s2">to be willing to bear that cost in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.540" end="00:15:36.930" style="s2">pursuit of you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.690" end="00:15:38.730" style="s2">well okay well this gets this gets very</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.930" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">interesting and things like the EU right</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.730" end="00:15:42.990" style="s2">so the EU has a range of countries</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:46.020" style="s2">inside of it from quite poor to very</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:47.460" style="s2">wealthy and they standardized a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.020" end="00:15:52.650" style="s2">things like labor law right across the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.460" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">EU on the basis it provided an equal</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.650" end="00:15:57.330" style="s2">economic playing field so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:15:59.070" style="s2">of discussion about using tariffs if</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.330" end="00:16:00.960" style="s2">something comes in from a country with</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.070" end="00:16:02.910" style="s2">shitty winger practices you swap a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.960" end="00:16:04.890" style="s2">twenty percent tariff on it to raise the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.910" end="00:16:06.210" style="s2">price to the same price that it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.890" end="00:16:07.950" style="s2">have been if it had been malefactor in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.210" end="00:16:10.170" style="s2">the country that decent labor practices</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.950" end="00:16:11.610" style="s2">and by doing that you take away the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.170" end="00:16:15.270" style="s2">economic incentive for having shitty</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.610" end="00:16:16.650" style="s2">labor practices and I think Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.270" end="00:16:19.590" style="s2">countries have done a bit of work around</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.650" end="00:16:21.210" style="s2">that although I don&#39;t know whether it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.590" end="00:16:23.880" style="s2">was theory or when they&#39;d actually done</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.210" end="00:16:26.310" style="s2">it um but I mean all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.880" end="00:16:28.440" style="s2">your point not are exactly this tendency</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.310" end="00:16:30.770" style="s2">of global capitalism to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.440" end="00:16:33.330" style="s2">to somebody and turn it into profit</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.770" end="00:16:36.030" style="s2">absolutely so I think we we all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.330" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">passionate about not recreating that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.030" end="00:16:39.540" style="s2">moving forward and so what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:42.030" style="s2">now is we&#39;ll switch it to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.540" end="00:16:44.400" style="s2">future version what is our ideal</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.030" end="00:16:46.950" style="s2">individual version of what a future</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.400" end="00:16:48.030" style="s2">could look like with zero slavery so</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.950" end="00:16:50.070" style="s2">throw that out there because if your</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.030" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">future one slavery I don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.070" end="00:16:56.760" style="s2">to hear about your future they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">need our ideas don&#39;t carry if you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.760" end="00:16:59.700" style="s2">have you got anything I mean you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:00.960" style="s2">said anything during the first 15</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.700" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">minutes if you got anything you want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.960" end="00:17:06.690" style="s2">put in on well basically I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:08.490" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about slavery as in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.690" end="00:17:10.530" style="s2">of what people are making what about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.490" end="00:17:14.940" style="s2">human trafficking isn&#39;t that slavery as</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.530" end="00:17:17.010" style="s2">well you know keep getting back to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.940" end="00:17:19.740" style="s2">so I&#39;m feeling about the youth you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.010" end="00:17:21.870" style="s2">the women and um people who are selling</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.740" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">their kids because I think the selling</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:27.720" style="s2">them on to work about a life for someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:31.470" style="s2">else and that that&#39;s that&#39;s my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.720" end="00:17:33.150" style="s2">horrors of slavery and as well as he can</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.470" end="00:17:35.460" style="s2">omit once you know because I remember</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.150" end="00:17:37.560" style="s2">watch your name so it looks wet and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.460" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">t-shirts I don&#39;t know what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.560" end="00:17:42.270" style="s2">nap you know with Stacey dude ages ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">she took all these posh fashion</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.270" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">conscious kids right I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.950" end="00:17:51.639" style="s2">and he went to have a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">fashion trade and where the cotton comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.639" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">from and he went left to live</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.519" style="s2">place the people who were making the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.649" style="s2">things and they were doing their</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.519" end="00:18:01.720" style="s2">absolute ly horrified you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.649" end="00:18:04.120" style="s2">and they were like what you&#39;d only get</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.720" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">into rupees a day and you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.120" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">new to st. Tyler and everything and as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">said it changed to change them all I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">said sort of them Kornacki and she did</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:18.309" style="s2">it in the food industry as well and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:20.830" style="s2">just took them to go it show and I think</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.830" end="00:18:26.200" style="s2">experience of how it&#39;s others then</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.639" end="00:18:28.179" style="s2">they&#39;ll change the mind and then they&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.110" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be the consumer bubble that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.860" end="00:18:57.909" style="s2">will a burst that would have died and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">people be more concerned about others</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.909" end="00:19:03.460" style="s2">and that and I think that&#39;s and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:06.220" style="s2">know how that was way but that thought</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.129" end="00:19:17.019" style="s2">much will Kerry was saying while there</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.659" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">are incentives out there to do horrible</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.019" end="00:19:21.070" style="s2">things to other people either the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.899" style="s2">of human trafficking you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.070" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">selling women and children whatever into</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.899" end="00:19:26.740" style="s2">sex slavery or whatever it might be I</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:28.899" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what viene was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.740" end="00:19:30.879" style="s2">right there the continuum of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.899" end="00:19:33.669" style="s2">that&#39;s right down at the very yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.879" end="00:19:36.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the far that&#39;s the far end of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.669" end="00:19:38.350" style="s2">but you know all all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.100" end="00:19:41.049" style="s2">they it is still if economic slavery</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.350" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">right the incentive for people to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.049" end="00:19:43.809" style="s2">these kids and ship them off to other</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.340" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">people is to make money right so it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.809" end="00:19:49.059" style="s2">still kind of economic slavery right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:51.970" style="s2">then until those insensitive structures</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.059" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">no longer exists those behaviors will</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.970" end="00:19:55.419" style="s2">continue right well while there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.700" style="s2">incentives around people to do that kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.419" end="00:19:58.899" style="s2">of people will continue to do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.700" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">right and you can&#39;t even blame the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.899" end="00:20:01.420" style="s2">individuals because if they don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:04.330" style="s2">someone else will do it you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;s so neat these things these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.330" end="00:20:09.630" style="s2">are systemic the only way I see is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">remove the incentives and thus the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.630" end="00:20:15.130" style="s2">ability the the levers of coercion that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:18.520" style="s2">exists within the structures of society</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.130" end="00:20:23.320" style="s2">which means that the safety net if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.520" end="00:20:26.020" style="s2">like the social fabric needs to include</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.320" end="00:20:27.340" style="s2">the certainty for everyone that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.020" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">never going to go hungry they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.340" end="00:20:30.070" style="s2">going to be homeless they&#39;re never going</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:33.040" style="s2">to be without water and power you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.070" end="00:20:36.190" style="s2">what I mean and you know that baseline</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.040" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">is always there and once that is in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.190" end="00:20:42.340" style="s2">place use the ability of one person to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:44.770" style="s2">exert coercion yeah and fear over</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.340" end="00:20:51.340" style="s2">another is massively diminished and thus</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.770" end="00:20:53.500" style="s2">the smae slavery disappear things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.340" end="00:20:55.000" style="s2">energy I and universal health care and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.500" end="00:20:56.620" style="s2">things like that other other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.000" end="00:20:58.420" style="s2">things that take us in that direction I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.620" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">mean I have my reservations about UB I</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.420" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">also but but those kinds of things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:05.380" style="s2">absolutely I mean if you&#39;re in a country</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">with basic income you&#39;re just not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.380" end="00:21:13.540" style="s2">get slavery it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:14.740" style="s2">straightforward right Yeah right mmm my</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.540" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">beautiful version of the future yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.740" end="00:21:18.970" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely no slavery and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:21.370" style="s2">even when Eric suggested is slavery</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.970" end="00:21:25.960" style="s2">nobody works anywhere they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">everybody has is able to pursue their</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.960" end="00:21:30.250" style="s2">passions and and do the labor that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:32.920" style="s2">want to do whether that&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.250" end="00:21:34.360" style="s2">mental physical and we have tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.920" end="00:21:36.310" style="s2">able to see what isn&#39;t getting done and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.360" end="00:21:40.570" style="s2">how can we actually get it done together</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.310" end="00:21:42.280" style="s2">a world where we do have our supply</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.570" end="00:21:43.900" style="s2">chain the information of our supply</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.280" end="00:21:46.060" style="s2">chain of readily available so we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.900" end="00:21:48.250" style="s2">actually do about it where it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.060" end="00:21:50.800" style="s2">it is easy for a good for a new for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.250" end="00:21:52.990" style="s2">new phone company that is that has a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.800" end="00:21:55.690" style="s2">model to be able to to market itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.990" end="00:21:57.790" style="s2">without too easily out compete the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">Android and the Apple phones because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.790" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">want that back when that phone first</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.320" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">came out I remember though that video</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:04.900" style="s2">going viral of the parts being swapped</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:07.900" style="s2">in and out if everyone who watched that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.900" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">video now knew that it existed and 25%</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.900" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">decided their next phone was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:15.100" style="s2">that or even 5% decided and we started</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:17.380" style="s2">looking at the camera but the economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.100" end="00:22:19.660" style="s2">term is if we made a hundred times that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.380" end="00:22:22.419" style="s2">we could also make them cheaper right in</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.660" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">an ethical way and look at well if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.419" end="00:22:27.160" style="s2">all want this phone what does it need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:29.049" style="s2">have and then having an open source that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.160" end="00:22:30.910" style="s2">we can actually improve the camera and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.049" end="00:22:32.830" style="s2">improve the thing and be able to swap it</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.910" end="00:22:34.630" style="s2">out and be able to look at the entire</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.830" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">supply chain and look at our human at</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.630" end="00:22:39.900" style="s2">humanity as a system that when we steal</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:42.730" style="s2">from somebody else it should it should</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.900" end="00:22:44.289" style="s2">cost us our soul and our emotion but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.730" end="00:22:46.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to keep your head in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.289" end="00:22:48.820" style="s2">sand in fact it&#39;s our entire system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.990" end="00:22:50.950" style="s2">designed that like consume consume</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.820" end="00:22:54.010" style="s2">consume and do not look at behind the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.950" end="00:22:56.770" style="s2">curtain do not look at the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.010" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">footprint and so to be and I get that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.770" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">asking people to do that is asking</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">people to take on the stress that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:04.419" style="s2">already taken on our whole lives without</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:06.190" style="s2">a solution and so to be able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.419" end="00:23:09.100" style="s2">solutions like the phone to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.190" end="00:23:11.559" style="s2">look at the supply chain and say it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.100" end="00:23:12.940" style="s2">easy as like if you choose to shop at</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.559" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">Walmart because it&#39;s best for your</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.940" end="00:23:16.390" style="s2">family because it&#39;s cheap but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">maybe not an auction that such a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.390" end="00:23:20.350" style="s2">cheapest Walmart but something that goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.210" style="s2">within their values and offers them a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.350" end="00:23:25.150" style="s2">way forward that they can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.210" end="00:23:28.570" style="s2">and create a better food system create a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.150" end="00:23:30.610" style="s2">better place to get clothing you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.570" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">not be so concerned about fashion not</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.610" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">being so concerned that even if fashion</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:35.860" style="s2">is important to you how can you get your</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:37.659" style="s2">fashion needs met without destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.860" end="00:23:41.020" style="s2">planet and people and so that&#39;s that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.659" end="00:23:43.150" style="s2">my beautiful future about you Vinnie a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.020" end="00:23:45.220" style="s2">what would you like to see twenty thirty</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.150" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">five years from now however long you</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.220" end="00:23:53.010" style="s2">need it to be so Gandhi did really a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:55.330" style="s2">bunch of work on this um you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.010" end="00:23:58.059" style="s2">symbol of India is the spinning wheel</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.330" end="00:24:03.030" style="s2">right and you&#39;ve all seen pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.059" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">Gandhi spinning cloth you know so oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.030" end="00:24:08.260" style="s2">yeah Gandhi spent an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">time talking about hand spinning or</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:14.970" style="s2">fiber cotton wool um as being critical</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:17.169" style="s2">for the Indian independence movement and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.970" end="00:24:19.990" style="s2">because at the time what you had was</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.169" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">mechanized mills in England that were</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.990" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">producing enormous went to cheap fabric</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:25.450" style="s2">that was causing mass unemployment in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:27.820" style="s2">India and also transferring a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.450" end="00:24:33.609" style="s2">bunch of wealth directly to the English</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.820" end="00:24:35.799" style="s2">so the Swadeshi movement right Gandhi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.609" end="00:24:39.389" style="s2">movement deliberate India Swadeshi which</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.799" end="00:24:42.460" style="s2">we alarmed was that you bought fabric</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.389" end="00:24:45.639" style="s2">preferentially from hand spinners in</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.460" end="00:24:47.019" style="s2">India even though it was many times the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.639" end="00:24:51.340" style="s2">cost of the fabric that you could import</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.019" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">from English and his reasoning was that</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.119" end="00:25:55.029" style="s2">anyway and what I can imagine is a</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.249" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">psychology of like oh yes we went to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.259" end="00:26:08.200" style="s2">farmers market and we bought our food</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.820" end="00:26:10.869" style="s2">and it was groomed by people that look</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.200" end="00:26:13.090" style="s2">pretty much like us like their kids go</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.869" end="00:26:15.099" style="s2">to the same school as our kids go to so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.090" end="00:26:18.129" style="s2">we know that this product was not made</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.099" end="00:26:20.499" style="s2">by slavery we know it wasn&#39;t made by you</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.869" end="00:26:29.259" style="s2">actually came from our class our people</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.259" end="00:26:38.019" style="s2">of parochial glossy insularity and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.789" end="00:26:39.940" style="s2">think Hans the potential to scale into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.019" end="00:26:41.290" style="s2">cultural movement a bit like veganism</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.940" end="00:26:42.610" style="s2">did you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.290" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">people to be activists on this stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">the same way that they are around</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:53.410" style="s2">veganism so I think the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:56.170" style="s2">could be a power bowel movement veganism</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.410" end="00:26:58.690" style="s2">which is slavery free and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.170" end="00:27:00.910" style="s2">environmentally sustainable and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.690" end="00:27:02.890" style="s2">becomes like a product category you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.910" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">you go into a shop they&#39;ve got all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.890" end="00:27:07.030" style="s2">regular clothing and then they have the</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.030" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">should close slavery free carbon offset</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.510" end="00:27:14.200" style="s2">last forever sustainable materials you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">know done another edit out of there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.200" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">no evil dyes used in the manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:23.710" style="s2">that I think is very believable as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:25.240" style="s2">cultural trend and certainly the success</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.710" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">of the vegetarians and the vegans have</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.240" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">mainstreaming those approaches I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:34.780" style="s2">the idea that you could extend that into</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:37.210" style="s2">retail is very portable pedestrian but</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.780" end="00:27:44.170" style="s2">you know that&#39;s okay it&#39;s feasible I</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">could see how we get there and it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.170" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">beautiful vision in the future and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">all shared a bit of how we get there -</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:51.460" style="s2">which was pretty awesome even if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:52.690" style="s2">weren&#39;t in alignment and switching over</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:27:54.100" style="s2">to the next one although we sell a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.690" end="00:27:56.380" style="s2">of time left in this one if anyone has</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.100" end="00:27:59.140" style="s2">any final thoughts I think the veganism</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.380" end="00:28:01.090" style="s2">part is is I have critiqued veganism a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.140" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">lot not in the you shouldn&#39;t be vegan</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.090" end="00:28:06.400" style="s2">but in the way vegans go about it they</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:07.810" style="s2">turn people off of veganism not towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.400" end="00:28:09.820" style="s2">it I know vegans who are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.810" end="00:28:12.250" style="s2">lovely will help you cook a meal and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.820" end="00:28:15.370" style="s2">those who like shame you into this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.250" end="00:28:17.950" style="s2">the only way and one is effective and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.370" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">one is not effective and so what looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.950" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">for in solution raising is those</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:26.260" style="s2">voluntary powerful things like veganism</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:28.030" style="s2">that can offer us a way forward to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.260" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">reduce our slavery footprint think would</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.030" end="00:28:33.010" style="s2">be powerful with ten thousand people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.420" style="s2">want to this and each putting in ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.010" end="00:28:37.330" style="s2">dollars so we have a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.420" end="00:28:38.980" style="s2">dollars to do something that&#39;s whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.330" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">that&#39;s ten dollars a month or ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.980" end="00:28:42.460" style="s2">dollars overall</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">maybe you need ten dollars per month</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:46.180" style="s2">with slavery right maybe it&#39;s too big to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:48.310" style="s2">deal with hundred thousand can I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.180" end="00:28:50.800" style="s2">put the one thing in on the vegan thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.310" end="00:28:52.330" style="s2">because this is it&#39;s kind of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.800" end="00:28:53.950" style="s2">with with our language in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.330" end="00:28:54.790" style="s2">we use language neither you either are</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">or are</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.790" end="00:29:01.210" style="s2">a vegan right and and you know any</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:02.890" style="s2">reduction in consumption of meat in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.210" end="00:29:05.680" style="s2">particular but you know animal products</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.890" end="00:29:07.270" style="s2">in general is it is to be applauded as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.680" end="00:29:09.640" style="s2">step in the right direction right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.270" end="00:29:11.170" style="s2">and and so you know that because you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.640" end="00:29:12.970" style="s2">still eat a couple of eggs a week and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.170" end="00:29:14.950" style="s2">and put milk in your coffee your you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.970" end="00:29:16.930" style="s2">know you you&#39;re still labeled as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.950" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">murderer and a killer this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.930" end="00:29:21.010" style="s2">ridiculous and as you say many many</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:25.090" style="s2">beacons that I have met not all by any</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.010" end="00:29:26.680" style="s2">means but but many are exactly that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.090" end="00:29:28.750" style="s2">they they put people off you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.680" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">mean you know you don&#39;t need to be so</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.750" end="00:29:32.920" style="s2">yeah that that the fact that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">word for it vegan you know to me rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.920" end="00:29:39.030" style="s2">than the notion of reducing reliance on</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:41.740" style="s2">animal products kind of thing right the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.030" end="00:29:44.200" style="s2">vegan is a is that you will your are or</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.740" end="00:29:46.750" style="s2">not this binary notion of you are or are</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.200" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">not a full-on vegan and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.750" end="00:29:51.190" style="s2">you&#39;re a vegetarian well we all kinda</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:52.570" style="s2">Charlie the labels does a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:55.870" style="s2">the problem I think you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:59.010" style="s2">beyond those into the actually important</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.870" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">parts of the ideas somehow is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.010" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">anyway yeah these are what trouble this</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:07.300" style="s2">in the squat movement used to call those</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:10.230" style="s2">guys the vegan Reich because he they</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.300" end="00:30:12.790" style="s2">would come in and take over squats and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.230" end="00:30:16.570" style="s2">basically force out anybody that kept</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.790" end="00:30:18.070" style="s2">bringing me or cheese into the squat it</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.570" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">was yeah it was quite contentious back</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.070" end="00:30:20.560" style="s2">in the day on the other hand they got</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2"> done you know maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.560" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">reasonable is not always the answer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:28.780" style="s2">true I mean I don&#39;t want the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:30.520" style="s2">are completely different than me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.780" end="00:30:32.680" style="s2">doing that necessarily the stuff because</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.520" end="00:30:34.990" style="s2">that is effective in its own way but</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.680" end="00:30:36.310" style="s2">also having options that are including</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.990" end="00:30:38.680" style="s2">for veganism that are a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.310" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">voluntary and something that is like how</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.680" end="00:30:41.380" style="s2">do we help ourselves so then it invite</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:43.060" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.380" end="00:30:45.790" style="s2">how does 10,000 people get together and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.060" end="00:30:47.890" style="s2">as weird as it sounds less in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.790" end="00:30:50.400" style="s2">slavery footprint right eat less not</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.890" end="00:30:52.270" style="s2">necessary you can&#39;t go from 38 to zero</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.400" end="00:30:55.390" style="s2">especially when you yourself are</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.270" end="00:30:58.840" style="s2">somewhat a slave to the system and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.390" end="00:31:00.730" style="s2">mean from my perspective the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.840" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">I want to do as a first measure here is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.730" end="00:31:05.680" style="s2">just inflict an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:08.590" style="s2">psychological pain on people right you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.680" end="00:31:10.630" style="s2">know we are all complicit in a system</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.590" end="00:31:12.070" style="s2">is closing enormous harm all mean for</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.070" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">before is that we you mean bye-bye yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.049" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly I mean right like because</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:20.940" style="s2">if people are completely insulated from</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.549" end="00:32:22.539" style="s2">Inessa result like you know the Greens</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.039" end="00:32:25.270" style="s2">just did not take that path in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.539" end="00:32:28.149" style="s2">concerted way the Greens always I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.270" end="00:32:31.240" style="s2">the amount of 50 wasted years on</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.149" end="00:32:33.130" style="s2">environmentalism literally 50 wasted</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.240" end="00:32:34.630" style="s2">years and because they weren&#39;t willing</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.130" end="00:32:35.799" style="s2">to speak truth to power they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.630" end="00:32:39.309" style="s2">willing to tell people what the hell was</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.799" end="00:32:41.649" style="s2">actually happened and were just catching</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.309" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">up on that now um I&#39;m trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.649" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">when was Silent Spring published it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.880" end="00:32:51.580" style="s2">we talked about this a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.140" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">before then hey have you seen that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.580" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">planet of the humans good 62</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">well 62 that was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.850" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.279" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">that first really high impact book about</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:15.580" style="s2">environmentalism I think probably maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:19.240" style="s2">um and you always think of it as being</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.580" end="00:33:20.899" style="s2">like late 70s no it was early 60s in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.240" end="00:33:22.669" style="s2">conceivably early and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.899" end="00:33:28.940" style="s2">I didn&#39;t see planet the humans I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.669" end="00:33:30.769" style="s2">think but yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.940" end="00:33:34.460" style="s2">bad rocks in this thing with like how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.769" end="00:33:35.899" style="s2">we get people to admit that the culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.460" end="00:33:38.719" style="s2">that we&#39;re in is extremely problematic</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.899" end="00:33:40.249" style="s2">even if they don&#39;t have much more a fix</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.719" end="00:33:43.729" style="s2">it right now just like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.249" end="00:33:47.330" style="s2">guys we have a problem kind of needs to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.729" end="00:33:48.710" style="s2">become part of our discourse as</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.330" end="00:33:51.229" style="s2">somebody&#39;s had never heard of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.710" end="00:33:54.169" style="s2">discourse since I was 15 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.229" end="00:33:56.629" style="s2">I&#39;m now 40 it has never been effective</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.169" end="00:33:59.779" style="s2">to shame people into environmental or</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.629" end="00:34:01.909" style="s2">our vegetarian when I was one or ethical</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.779" end="00:34:03.950" style="s2">even this right even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.909" end="00:34:05.690" style="s2">slavery we get more people at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:08.149" style="s2">solution raising when it&#39;s on food or</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.690" end="00:34:10.250" style="s2">clothing or or something that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.149" end="00:34:12.440" style="s2">like ok yeah when it&#39;s the big things</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.250" end="00:34:14.409" style="s2">like slavery they&#39;re like oh it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">much and that&#39;s with people who care</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.409" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">yeah that making people like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:22.700" style="s2">we all have about as much trauma as we</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:24.169" style="s2">can handle and looking at ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.700" end="00:34:27.619" style="s2">things like you bi looking at ways to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.169" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">actually reduce as weird as it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.619" end="00:34:31.609" style="s2">the west&#39;s trauma so that we&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">consumer driven right connect us so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.609" end="00:34:36.799" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to fill that hole in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:40.089" style="s2">soul with more like fashion right</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.799" end="00:34:42.230" style="s2">that being able to look at our</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.089" end="00:34:44.329" style="s2">electronics how long do they last and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.230" end="00:34:45.319" style="s2">why are like why is Apple coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.329" end="00:34:47.149" style="s2">a new one every two years</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.319" end="00:34:49.609" style="s2">why are my laptops not lasting very long</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.149" end="00:34:52.250" style="s2">because that is a huge as well as how</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.609" end="00:34:53.750" style="s2">much slavery went into it the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.250" end="00:34:54.889" style="s2">I have to buy a new one every two to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.750" end="00:34:57.710" style="s2">three years the fact there aren&#39;t ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.889" end="00:35:01.369" style="s2">to repair them the fact that like how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:03.109" style="s2">we look at well and doing it from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.369" end="00:35:05.539" style="s2">that angle like well there can be four</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.109" end="00:35:07.970" style="s2">pear shops there can be a way to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.539" end="00:35:10.730" style="s2">that the fairphone right there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.970" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">to look at mapping the supply chain and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.730" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">then looking at where can we have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:17.299" style="s2">most impact right now is 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:19.339" style="s2">right maybe maybe it&#39;s not electronics</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.299" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s huge er maybe it is clothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.339" end="00:35:24.049" style="s2">right how can I get my clothing needs</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.279" style="s2">met how can I actually wear clothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.049" end="00:35:26.990" style="s2">that&#39;s ethical and look at the entire</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.279" end="00:35:29.089" style="s2">supply chain or how can I grow my own</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.990" end="00:35:30.260" style="s2">food so that I don&#39;t have to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.089" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">farmers or because I look at the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.260" end="00:35:34.490" style="s2">market is a very not on mmm inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.230" style="s2">and like so the farmer</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.490" end="00:35:38.420" style="s2">have to take their stuff bring it here</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.230" end="00:35:40.250" style="s2">so we can all go shop instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.420" end="00:35:42.080" style="s2">they have better things to do with their</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.250" end="00:35:44.600" style="s2">time I have better things to do in my</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.080" end="00:35:47.300" style="s2">time that have an artisan experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.600" end="00:35:49.070" style="s2">instead of I need food delivered to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.300" end="00:35:51.710" style="s2">and I need the people who make it to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.070" end="00:35:53.780" style="s2">have decent lives yes and I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.710" end="00:35:55.369" style="s2">communities for in agriculture I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.780" end="00:35:58.460" style="s2">is here a real sweet spot on that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.369" end="00:36:00.410" style="s2">that it&#39;s economically efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.460" end="00:36:03.410" style="s2">also pretty good from an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.410" end="00:36:04.970" style="s2">perspective you know the all these kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.410" end="00:36:06.140" style="s2">of box delivery schemes you have in</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.970" end="00:36:07.880" style="s2">cities now where they just dump</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.140" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">vegetables on your doorstep once a week</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.880" end="00:36:11.240" style="s2">that stuff&#39;s really good like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:18.350" style="s2">actually a pretty efficient way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.240" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">things I mean there is a my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.350" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">about this is that we&#39;ve had really I</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:28.250" style="s2">mean so 62 for Silent Spring 80 years of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2">encouraging people to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.250" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">and and an attempting to work inside a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">consumer society to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">solutions and there have been occasional</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.109" style="s2">breakouts like the electric car stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.650" end="00:36:41.210" style="s2">an enormous breakthrough if it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.109" end="00:36:43.010" style="s2">inside of that paradigm right Tassel</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.210" end="00:36:47.030" style="s2">sold cars because they were really</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.010" end="00:36:49.310" style="s2">really fast by oh my god you want away</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.030" end="00:36:53.240" style="s2">it will dust the porch for $35,000 car</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.310" end="00:36:55.490" style="s2">buy a Tesla um but for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.240" end="00:36:57.350" style="s2">given that we&#39;re 80 years into this</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.490" end="00:37:00.380" style="s2">stuff the actual impact has been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.350" end="00:37:02.390" style="s2">negligible right we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.380" end="00:37:05.740" style="s2">kind of softs hoping people along really</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.390" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">at this point for four generations and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.740" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">the actual baseline movement is almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:13.369" style="s2">impossible to measure it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:15.260" style="s2">tiny and so now I think we&#39;re back at</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.369" end="00:37:18.200" style="s2">the park where the logical strategy is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.260" end="00:37:21.470" style="s2">just to completely destroy people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.200" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">the thing is the thing as DubLi sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.470" end="00:37:27.230" style="s2">alluded to and she said it&#39;s too big</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:29.570" style="s2">right the changing of the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.230" end="00:37:31.880" style="s2">supply chains and the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.570" end="00:37:34.970" style="s2">manufacturing and the ethic board you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.880" end="00:37:35.930" style="s2">know the especially what Jubilee is</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.970" end="00:37:37.910" style="s2">talking about with the built-in</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.930" end="00:37:40.850" style="s2">obsolescence that exists in goods right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.910" end="00:37:43.430" style="s2">and this is this is a necessary thing in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.850" end="00:37:45.310" style="s2">order to keep money moving around the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.430" end="00:37:50.020" style="s2">system you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.310" end="00:37:51.360" style="s2">and so you changed its in isolation this</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.020" end="00:37:54.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change without the entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.360" end="00:37:55.510" style="s2">financial monetary economic model also</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.070" end="00:37:56.710" style="s2">changing right along with it you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.510" end="00:37:59.620" style="s2">what I mean though the two are</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.710" end="00:38:03.970" style="s2">inextricably linked together you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.620" end="00:38:05.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve drained it my system collapses</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.970" end="00:38:07.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no way around that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.620" end="00:38:11.650" style="s2">but I mean designed obsolescence is only</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.750" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">really 1940s 1950s right we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:16.120" style="s2">documentation of the meetings like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:17.620" style="s2">know the white bulb cartel which just</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.120" end="00:38:19.750" style="s2">went in that curve was starting to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.620" end="00:38:21.730" style="s2">steepen yeah when that when the you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.750" end="00:38:23.530" style="s2">the money creation code was just</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.730" end="00:38:25.330" style="s2">beginning to steep and at that point I</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.530" end="00:38:27.250" style="s2">mean now it&#39;s almost vertical right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.330" end="00:38:31.090" style="s2">that that was the point at which it</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.250" end="00:38:33.430" style="s2">started to steepen sure we have actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.090" end="00:38:34.570" style="s2">documentation of the organization that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.430" end="00:38:39.660" style="s2">was created by the light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.570" end="00:38:42.220" style="s2">manufacturers - yes right or am i right</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.660" end="00:38:44.170" style="s2">so it&#39;s not very often that we get</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.220" end="00:38:46.450" style="s2">actual documentation of the conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.170" end="00:38:48.010" style="s2">right the fact that we know the name of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.450" end="00:38:50.410" style="s2">the organization that did the light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.010" end="00:38:52.030" style="s2">conspiracy and the color of committee</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.410" end="00:38:53.950" style="s2">right the group that decides what colors</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.030" end="00:38:55.630" style="s2">will be fashionable each year you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.950" end="00:38:57.670" style="s2">every year pound - um publishes here is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.630" end="00:38:59.080" style="s2">our color of the year and the same in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.670" end="00:39:01.690" style="s2">fashion world so there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.080" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">instances where we&#39;ve got these you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.690" end="00:39:04.900" style="s2">kind of bang to rights like okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:06.070" style="s2">the place where the industry is pushing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.900" end="00:39:09.400" style="s2">this kind of obsolescence</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.070" end="00:39:11.970" style="s2">but even if we fix all of that it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.400" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">for 10% of our environmental impact</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.970" end="00:39:18.970" style="s2">right it&#39;s a tiny tiny tiny part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:21.570" style="s2">problem right Americans are seventeen</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.970" end="00:39:24.600" style="s2">and a half tons of co2 per person and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.570" end="00:39:28.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the average the sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.600" end="00:39:32.020" style="s2">emission is about two times maybe three</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.440" end="00:39:34.060" style="s2">right so hopefully with your notion of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:35.950" style="s2">it being negligible because it extends</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.060" end="00:39:37.300" style="s2">everywhere this notion of building</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.950" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">things not to last</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.300" end="00:39:41.940" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s everywhere every part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:44.830" style="s2">every car you know it&#39;s it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.940" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">and so I disagree that it&#39;s not I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.830" end="00:39:48.040" style="s2">don&#39;t have a number and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:50.530" style="s2">research to back this up but my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.040" end="00:39:53.790" style="s2">that it is far from negligible it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.530" end="00:39:57.940" style="s2">actually a massive piece so industry</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.790" end="00:39:59.170" style="s2">ahead I say this exactly so if you take</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.940" end="00:40:02.200" style="s2">clothing right all</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.170" end="00:40:04.059" style="s2">fast fashion stuff together is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.200" end="00:40:05.910" style="s2">say something like four or five percent</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.059" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">of the human races environmental impact</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.910" end="00:40:09.910" style="s2">right so you could say okay there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">four or five things I how about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.910" end="00:40:13.690" style="s2">much damage each in the tool would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:17.140" style="s2">about ten or twenty percent and the tool</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.690" end="00:40:20.530" style="s2">might be ten or twenty percent right but</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.140" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">then right behind that you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.530" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">got the really you know big heads right</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:29.260" style="s2">agriculture heating of houses</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:33.819" style="s2">construction protection power generation</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.260" end="00:40:35.290" style="s2">yeah focus on on so Vinnie a seems like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.819" end="00:40:36.940" style="s2">you&#39;re very very knowledgeable in both</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.290" end="00:40:39.240" style="s2">the environmental and slavery one which</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.940" end="00:40:42.609" style="s2">is the industry that has the number one</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.240" end="00:40:44.470" style="s2">slavery imprint that we have right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.609" end="00:40:46.089" style="s2">the sex industry might be one but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.470" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">don&#39;t use the sex industry including</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.089" end="00:40:50.770" style="s2">porn and stuff so I have no no dollar no</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:52.660" style="s2">eyeballs to spend one-way births as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">other so what is it what is if we were</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.660" end="00:40:55.829" style="s2">to have the biggest impact on slavery</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">except that we&#39;re talking about today</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.829" end="00:41:01.030" style="s2">what would be the industry you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:06.130" style="s2">suggest we focus on so Helen is the real</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.030" end="00:41:09.400" style="s2">expert on this stuff right but so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.130" end="00:41:12.250" style="s2">areas there are specific niche products</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.400" end="00:41:15.010" style="s2">which have real problems right um shrimp</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.250" end="00:41:18.099" style="s2">for example often has a ton of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.010" end="00:41:21.490" style="s2">embedded and protrude in general right</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.099" end="00:41:23.559" style="s2">yeah general there are a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.490" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">problems you know fruit picking you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.559" end="00:41:28.059" style="s2">you get your food from Mexico guess what</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:30.900" style="s2">the living conditions like at G Joe Lou</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.059" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">the name of God called Cesar Chavez</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.900" end="00:41:34.599" style="s2">tried to unionize fruit pickers in</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:41.530" style="s2">California and got shot in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.599" end="00:41:45.099" style="s2">the head um so this yeah yes Cuba Cesar</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.530" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">Chavez so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.099" end="00:41:52.930" style="s2">limited window for individual consumer</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:54.790" style="s2">choice on these matters right a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.930" end="00:41:56.740" style="s2">bit here a little bit there fair trade</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.790" end="00:41:57.250" style="s2">whenever fair trade is available by fair</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.740" end="00:41:58.869" style="s2">trade</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.250" end="00:42:01.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.869" end="00:42:04.030" style="s2">pretty widely available right clothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.980" end="00:42:06.940" style="s2">manufactured in first world countries</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.030" end="00:42:08.799" style="s2">where possible right by durable things</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.940" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">durable things dude all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.799" end="00:42:15.980" style="s2">stuff certainly helps um but the real</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:18.799" style="s2">the real problem here the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.980" end="00:42:20.749" style="s2">getting us over the hump is people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.799" end="00:42:22.489" style="s2">desire to believe if the even of their</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.749" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2">lifestyles are completely unethical they</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.489" end="00:42:28.759" style="s2">themselves are good people right and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.390" end="00:42:31.069" style="s2">have to pull the pin that moral harmed</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.759" end="00:42:33.230" style="s2">grenade because that moral hand grenade</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.069" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">is at the heart of colonialism that is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.230" end="00:42:38.119" style="s2">fiction that mainly the British but</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">other Europeans wrapped around</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.119" end="00:42:42.559" style="s2">themselves in the early days of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:44.059" style="s2">colonialism as a way of protecting them</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.559" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">from the moral consequences of their</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.059" end="00:42:48.019" style="s2">actions my issue is have you ever had</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.700" style="s2">anybody become a better person when</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.019" end="00:42:53.930" style="s2">you&#39;ve pulled the pin out of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.700" end="00:42:56.359" style="s2">thinking they&#39;re a good um do they start</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.930" end="00:42:58.039" style="s2">making better choices cuz I again since</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.359" end="00:42:59.779" style="s2">I was 50 and have been trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.039" end="00:43:01.309" style="s2">and in fact the opposite has been has</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.779" end="00:43:02.869" style="s2">been the case so let&#39;s let&#39;s say this</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.309" end="00:43:04.430" style="s2">the shrimp industry you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.869" end="00:43:06.710" style="s2">even if that isn&#39;t true right the shrimp</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.430" end="00:43:09.380" style="s2">industry is the number one place for</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.710" end="00:43:11.089" style="s2">their slavery that we have unpacked on I</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.069" end="00:44:09.559" style="s2">who weren&#39;t having organic bananas they</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.630" end="00:44:11.630" style="s2">were just being sprayed with pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.559" end="00:44:13.069" style="s2">I was like I&#39;m never eating a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.630" end="00:44:15.349" style="s2">non-organic banana again because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.069" end="00:44:16.670" style="s2">not about me it&#39;s not organic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.349" end="00:44:19.460" style="s2">organic bananas are actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.670" end="00:44:21.739" style="s2">close for me like the consumer they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.460" end="00:44:23.089" style="s2">one of the clean ones but not when</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.739" end="00:44:25.640" style="s2">they&#39;re being made right for the worker</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.089" end="00:44:26.330" style="s2">to say that about shrimp right to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.640" end="00:44:27.590" style="s2">like I&#39;m Ned</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.330" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna eat shrimp again that means</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.590" end="00:44:33.020" style="s2">that children are drowning but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:34.490" style="s2">no way to do that by myself besides</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.020" end="00:44:35.810" style="s2">spending a lot of money or just not</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.490" end="00:44:37.820" style="s2">eating a shrimp which is not gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.810" end="00:44:41.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s not gonna give money to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.820" end="00:44:43.490" style="s2">to the ethical rip farmers right so how</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.270" end="00:44:45.410" style="s2">do we get ten thousand people to never</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.490" end="00:44:47.300" style="s2">eat the bad shrimp again</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.410" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">what could we create and it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.300" end="00:44:50.690" style="s2">shrimp farm really like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:51.980" style="s2">forty-nine shrimp are could feed ten</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.690" end="00:44:54.200" style="s2">thousand people the shrimp for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.980" end="00:44:57.350" style="s2">of their lives yeah that median price</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.200" end="00:44:59.930" style="s2">for and actually impact communities or</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.350" end="00:45:01.820" style="s2">in agriculture but now for seafood right</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.930" end="00:45:04.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean in Canada right you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.820" end="00:45:05.600" style="s2">salmon farming that there must be ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.130" end="00:45:07.190" style="s2">of doing it which are organic and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.600" end="00:45:11.270" style="s2">wastage are there are things we could be</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.190" end="00:45:13.010" style="s2">doing like this the but the you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.270" end="00:45:16.040" style="s2">saying like how many times just pulling</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.010" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">the pin out work right and you know pull</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.040" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">the pin out is how I got to be Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:21.980" style="s2">right pulling the pin out is how Gandhi</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:23.600" style="s2">got to be who Gandhi is pulling the pin</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.980" end="00:45:27.080" style="s2">out is how you got to be who you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.600" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">right so pulling the pin out from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.080" end="00:45:30.740" style="s2">people that are currently fast asleep</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.910" style="s2">and simply feeding on other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.740" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">for a living doesn&#39;t really work right</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.910" end="00:45:39.730" style="s2">what we do need is we need the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:43.160" style="s2">that have already pulled the pin out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.730" end="00:45:45.320" style="s2">get a very clear way of recognizing each</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.160" end="00:45:48.080" style="s2">other and then figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.320" end="00:45:49.340" style="s2">collaborate right because there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.080" end="00:45:50.450" style="s2">enough people who&#39;ve pulled the pin out</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.340" end="00:45:52.570" style="s2">and realized that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.450" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">fundamentally a hell&#39;s really good PR</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.570" end="00:45:59.750" style="s2">that you can get right and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:01.240" style="s2">goes back to the seed of Colonials and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.750" end="00:46:03.620" style="s2">the way that the English sold themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.240" end="00:46:05.330" style="s2">colonialism was the idea that what they</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.620" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">were taking with Christianity to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.330" end="00:46:09.230" style="s2">savages and these people were going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:10.820" style="s2">go to hell unless the English enslave</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.230" end="00:46:13.370" style="s2">them enforce the Bible down their throat</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.820" end="00:46:17.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s how the English sold</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.370" end="00:46:19.790" style="s2">themselves mass murder as a an</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.560" end="00:46:22.520" style="s2">industrial business model for an entire</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.790" end="00:46:24.710" style="s2">civilization if they hadn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.520" end="00:46:26.390" style="s2">crystianna you wash their hands they</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.710" end="00:46:28.700" style="s2">would have been incapable amounting</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.390" end="00:46:30.620" style="s2">violence on that scale if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.700" end="00:46:32.360" style="s2">a religious belief that the violence</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.620" end="00:46:34.040" style="s2">that you&#39;re inflicting is good violence</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.360" end="00:46:37.100" style="s2">most people can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.040" end="00:46:38.180" style="s2">you guys don&#39;t yeah and there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.100" end="00:46:40.130" style="s2">large number of people who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:41.990" style="s2">themselves directly</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.130" end="00:46:44.030" style="s2">doing the violence right and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.990" end="00:46:45.910" style="s2">the notion putting the curtain back is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.030" end="00:46:49.220" style="s2">really important one because that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.910" end="00:46:50.780" style="s2">it&#39;s less of a personal attack right</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.220" end="00:46:53.150" style="s2">than the pulling the pin out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.780" end="00:46:54.230" style="s2">vibe the pulling the curtain back for</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.150" end="00:46:56.150" style="s2">all to see</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.230" end="00:46:57.530" style="s2">right it&#39;s not like grabbing the back of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.150" end="00:46:59.840" style="s2">your head and shoving it through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.530" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">curtain right it&#39;s like pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.840" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">curtain back so that all can see it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.170" style="s2">you know once you see it it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.990" style="s2">look away you know and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.170" end="00:47:12.350" style="s2">unsee once you&#39;ve seen it that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.990" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">thing Carrie made this point about I</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.350" end="00:47:17.270" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what it was but she she</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.860" style="s2">brought this up I think to do I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.270" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">know what it was in relation to but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.860" end="00:47:23.510" style="s2">know if people saw the conditions in</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:24.950" style="s2">which people were working in order to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.510" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">produce their goods if people saw the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.950" end="00:47:30.200" style="s2">conditions in which animals were stored</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:32.210" style="s2">and slaughtered and processed you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.200" end="00:47:35.480" style="s2">what I mean people actually saw all this</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.210" end="00:47:36.740" style="s2">all better still were brought to it who</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.480" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">was the woman that you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.740" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">about Carrie that was she chaired I</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:44.110" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what you told a story</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.110" style="s2">about someone who went to somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.780" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">but you know if more people have that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.890" end="00:47:51.740" style="s2">kind of experience even if it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.540" end="00:47:53.300" style="s2">seeing it on television they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.740" end="00:47:55.010" style="s2">actually going there and living it right</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.300" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">even if it was only seeing it on</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.010" end="00:48:06.230" style="s2">provisional you can see on telly but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:09.590" style="s2">just saying on a large scale that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.230" end="00:48:12.500" style="s2">maybe maybe not so feasible but you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.590" end="00:48:13.940" style="s2">instead of every news report being</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:15.590" style="s2">breaks it breaks it breaks it breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.940" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">breaks it and then Kobe Kobe Kobe Kobe</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.590" end="00:48:21.260" style="s2">Kobe Kobe I mean how about some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:23.420" style="s2">you know that every day there is some</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.260" end="00:48:25.160" style="s2">reminder of you know the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.420" end="00:48:28.040" style="s2">going on in the world in order that week</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.160" end="00:48:29.270" style="s2">as you know so that we because I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.040" end="00:48:31.130" style="s2">think what you&#39;re saying I think is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.270" end="00:48:32.630" style="s2">partly true venae about wrapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.130" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">yourself in a cloak of we&#39;re doing good</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.630" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">in the world and therefore the horrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:39.230" style="s2"> we do is justified in the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:41.210" style="s2">of that larger good right I that is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.230" end="00:48:43.730" style="s2">is partially true but I also think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.210" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">notion of being able to pretend it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.730" end="00:48:47.770" style="s2">there because it&#39;s not right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">you I think that&#39;s even more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.770" end="00:48:52.910" style="s2">absolutely true mechanism so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:53.660" style="s2">talk about group choir called Grossman</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.910" end="00:48:57.170" style="s2">called on</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.660" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">killing right and what Grossman has</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.170" end="00:49:00.140" style="s2">collected together is all the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:03.020" style="s2">that soldiers are completely unwilling</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.140" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">to kill each other right like World War</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.020" end="00:49:08.030" style="s2">one practically all of the soldiers shot</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:10.849" style="s2">over the heads if the opposing side</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.030" end="00:49:12.890" style="s2">rather than album World War two I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.849" end="00:49:13.940" style="s2">that something like 30% of the personnel</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.890" end="00:49:15.770" style="s2">were actually willing to point a gun</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.940" end="00:49:18.140" style="s2">somebody and pull the trigger even in</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.770" end="00:49:19.490" style="s2">combat situations they were largely</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.140" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">ineffective because there&#39;s an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.490" end="00:49:24.740" style="s2">internal moral framework that even</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:26.230" style="s2">stopped soldiers from killing the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.740" end="00:49:28.970" style="s2">when they&#39;re given the opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.230" end="00:49:30.410" style="s2">they&#39;ve worked really really hard in</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.970" end="00:49:32.030" style="s2">terms of military training and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:34.670" style="s2">psychological management to get people</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.030" end="00:49:36.849" style="s2">to kill and it&#39;s you know they&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.670" end="00:49:39.589" style="s2">better over time but the basic model</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.849" end="00:49:42.049" style="s2">soldiers were very reluctant to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.589" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">people and I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.049" end="00:49:48.349" style="s2">pretty good evidence of quite strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:49.970" style="s2">innate human morality that it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.349" end="00:49:54.920" style="s2">the creation of an entire civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.970" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">and an entire culture to reverse right</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.920" end="00:49:59.029" style="s2">like the basic human tendency not to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:01.490" style="s2">just people over and destroy them</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.029" end="00:50:03.670" style="s2">is really strong and then what we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.490" end="00:50:06.260" style="s2">is hundreds of years of acculturation</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.670" end="00:50:08.599" style="s2">layered over each other to build a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.260" end="00:50:11.329" style="s2">psychological matrix which allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.599" end="00:50:14.450" style="s2">do this and I think that the destruction</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.329" end="00:50:18.230" style="s2">of that psychological program is much</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.450" end="00:50:20.900" style="s2">more practical as a solution broadly</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.230" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">than we&#39;ve given it credit for because</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.900" end="00:50:26.809" style="s2">it gets us environment it gets us</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:28.730" style="s2">slavery it gets us health you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.809" end="00:50:31.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just the problematization of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">industrial capitalism like okay guys</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.130" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">this industrial capitalism thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.990" end="00:50:37.670" style="s2">feeding us all yeah it&#39;s destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:39.230" style="s2">world what holy what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.670" end="00:50:41.539" style="s2">it&#39;s destroying the world well let me</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.230" end="00:50:42.980" style="s2">get the graphs right and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.539" end="00:50:46.130" style="s2">realization of like wait a minute it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.980" end="00:50:48.829" style="s2">the whole thing I think is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.130" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">the shortcut right because if we deal</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.829" end="00:50:52.910" style="s2">with this as 58 million individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">issues we have 58 million pressure</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.910" end="00:50:58.010" style="s2">groups and what we came to need is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.809" style="s2">single thesis which is industrial</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.010" end="00:51:04.130" style="s2">capitalism is killing the world and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.809" end="00:51:06.380" style="s2">killing us and once we get over that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.130" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">hump it becomes much easier for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.380" end="00:51:09.610" style="s2">people that are building</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:12.170" style="s2">to kind of work together on this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.610" end="00:51:14.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve taken a few crocks at that right</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.170" end="00:51:18.890" style="s2">there was um do you remember who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.270" end="00:51:23.720" style="s2">that book one one no many S&#39;s was that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.890" end="00:51:25.070" style="s2">Paul Hawken but I want to ask you many</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.720" end="00:51:27.710" style="s2">what do you think is the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.070" end="00:51:29.540" style="s2">thing we could do with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.710" end="00:51:32.510" style="s2">$100,000 because you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.540" end="00:51:34.700" style="s2">very very big Mehta for me what I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.510" end="00:51:37.130" style="s2">is 10,000 people to figure out how they</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.700" end="00:51:39.110" style="s2">produce their food food food footprint</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.130" end="00:51:41.000" style="s2">for environmental and slavery because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.110" end="00:51:42.350" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about people not</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.000" end="00:51:44.930" style="s2">wanting to kill each other and we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.350" end="00:51:46.820" style="s2">so much of an industrial system to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.930" end="00:51:48.650" style="s2">them to kill each other to go against</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.820" end="00:51:50.300" style="s2">their human nature people want to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.650" end="00:51:51.650" style="s2">good but they don&#39;t have another option</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.300" end="00:51:53.570" style="s2">if your options going to the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.650" end="00:51:55.610" style="s2">market I&#39;m telling you I can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.570" end="00:51:57.170" style="s2">that but if there was a system I could</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.610" end="00:51:59.030" style="s2">opt into where you&#39;re like listen this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.170" end="00:52:00.980" style="s2">basket of food that you and your kid</p>

<p begin="00:52:02.810" end="00:52:06.320" style="s2">500 dollars a month for this whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.550" end="00:52:07.970" style="s2">the system was I would sign up for that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.320" end="00:52:09.850" style="s2">in a heartbeat but it doesn&#39;t exist or</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.970" end="00:52:12.200" style="s2">it exists and I don&#39;t know about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.850" end="00:52:14.060" style="s2">gemstone creating stops eating for</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.200" end="00:52:15.800" style="s2">10,000 people and then inviting people</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.060" end="00:52:17.150" style="s2">so that it&#39;s voluntary is what these</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.800" end="00:52:19.250" style="s2">solution raisins are excellence we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.150" end="00:52:21.320" style="s2">showcase that you could salt you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.250" end="00:52:22.850" style="s2">improve anything with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.320" end="00:52:27.550" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars then you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.850" end="00:52:29.510" style="s2">improve everything but first it&#39;s fine I</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.550" end="00:52:31.550" style="s2">gotta say yeah I mean I think if you</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.800" end="00:53:00.619" style="s2">vendor that can give us the lowest price</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:03.020" style="s2">the highest quality and perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.619" end="00:53:04.609" style="s2">environmental and social guarantees so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.020" end="00:53:07.130" style="s2">the notion that you could have like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.609" end="00:53:09.020" style="s2">buyers club where you bulk purchase</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.130" end="00:53:12.020" style="s2">enormous quantities of sustainable goods</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.020" end="00:53:14.180" style="s2">from people and ideally repeated value</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.020" end="00:53:16.460" style="s2">right we&#39;re gonna you know for one year</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.180" end="00:53:19.100" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna basically have 10% of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.460" end="00:53:21.349" style="s2">order place each month for 10 months so</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.100" end="00:53:23.239" style="s2">you get a nice cutting even flow</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.349" end="00:53:24.979" style="s2">I bet that their manufacturers are doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.239" end="00:53:27.650" style="s2">this kind of sustainable stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.979" end="00:53:30.469" style="s2">would absolutely die for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.650" end="00:53:32.390" style="s2">opportunity right you know sandals right</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.469" end="00:53:35.180" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get flip floats aid in five</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.390" end="00:53:37.579" style="s2">sizes they&#39;re gonna last 200 years the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.180" end="00:53:40.239" style="s2">75 bucks each and we&#39;re gonna approach</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.579" end="00:53:42.799" style="s2">you with you know a two-year order and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.239" end="00:53:44.660" style="s2">those kind of approaches I think this</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.799" end="00:53:48.259" style="s2">kind of you know 10,000 person</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.660" end="00:53:50.900" style="s2">solidarity unit very very very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.259" end="00:53:53.509" style="s2">and if you have those consumers wrangle</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.900" end="00:53:55.729" style="s2">together vendors can then approach it</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.509" end="00:53:59.719" style="s2">say okay the next thing for the bulk buy</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.729" end="00:54:01.579" style="s2">what do you think of this you know every</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.719" end="00:54:02.989" style="s2">three months every six months the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.579" end="00:54:05.209" style="s2">community picks a new thing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.989" end="00:54:07.579" style="s2">bulk buy on a year later they&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.209" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">gotten maybe those kind of approaches I</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.579" end="00:54:12.170" style="s2">like that there&#39;s something similar that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:15.380" style="s2">I&#39;m part of has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.170" end="00:54:16.910" style="s2">ethical it&#39;s like a mom&#39;s buying Club</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.380" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">where it&#39;s because so we have to share</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.910" end="00:54:20.299" style="s2">in shipping and then someone breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:22.099" style="s2">up and we doing something like that on</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.299" end="00:54:24.769" style="s2">scale of 10,000 people or we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.099" end="00:54:27.019" style="s2">hey yes let&#39;s focus on phones because</p>

<p begin="00:54:27.019" end="00:54:30.410" style="s2">of the 10,000 we&#39;re getting that phone</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.759" end="00:54:32.209" style="s2">they also gonna share with their friends</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.410" end="00:54:34.489" style="s2">and family right and be like hey who</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.209" end="00:54:35.630" style="s2">wants to come in on this bye because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.489" end="00:54:38.269" style="s2">is big enough to do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.630" end="00:54:40.039" style="s2">I think Carrie has something yeah just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.269" end="00:54:42.049" style="s2">yeah I like that idea as well cheaply</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.039" end="00:54:46.009" style="s2">and other centers once we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.049" end="00:54:48.380" style="s2">10,000 it starts to pop I his cloak both</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.380" end="00:54:52.279" style="s2">connect with the other buyers cloaks and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.180" end="00:54:56.059" style="s2">then that kind of makes what I did as</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.279" end="00:54:57.739" style="s2">well you know and people know like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.059" end="00:54:59.209" style="s2">person with the new idea also knows</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.739" end="00:55:01.819" style="s2">where to go to write that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.209" end="00:55:03.529" style="s2">have to start in a brand new market it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.829" end="00:55:18.890" style="s2">when this buyers club gets big enough</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.500" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">once you go a big enough network of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.120" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">people you can start sort like highlight</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">in is that a proposed in shitty memes</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:56:01.190" style="s2">about somebody fat</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.620" end="00:56:07.490" style="s2">to raise awareness of the things they</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.300" end="00:56:10.940" style="s2">could be doing that would work you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.490" end="00:56:13.310" style="s2">we be sort of convinced by a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.940" end="00:56:15.590" style="s2">powerlessness the the book I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.310" end="00:56:18.920" style="s2">for one know many S&#39;s Paul Kings north</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.590" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">and he basically did a tour of all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.920" end="00:56:23.060" style="s2">the kind of anti-capitalist green</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:24.800" style="s2">resistance stuff around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.060" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">basically said look we all greed what</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.800" end="00:56:28.910" style="s2">the problem is and then everybody so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:31.010" style="s2">recorder of a solution the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.910" end="00:56:33.980" style="s2">that I think we could feasibly move</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.010" end="00:56:38.090" style="s2">towards right in let&#39;s say 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.980" end="00:56:40.910" style="s2">maybe lass am is the idea that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.090" end="00:56:43.670" style="s2">got a lifestyle where the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.910" end="00:56:46.660" style="s2">of the things you own you are sure are</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.670" end="00:56:49.700" style="s2">not poisonous toxic contaminated</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.660" end="00:56:50.150" style="s2">destructive you know like where did this</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.700" end="00:56:52.490" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.150" end="00:56:54.650" style="s2">okay it came from here and I trust it</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.490" end="00:56:57.230" style="s2">and so you begin to have an experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.650" end="00:56:59.900" style="s2">in the same with vegetarians vegans do</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.230" end="00:57:02.180" style="s2">where when somebody serves you something</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.900" end="00:57:05.420" style="s2">that is not up to your standards your</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.180" end="00:57:07.490" style="s2">right way no this is not my thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.420" end="00:57:10.220" style="s2">uh-huh and right now it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.490" end="00:57:12.110" style="s2">impossible to do that right like almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.220" end="00:57:14.210" style="s2">nobody no matter how dedicated they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.110" end="00:57:16.700" style="s2">can burn a clean spot for everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.210" end="00:57:19.490" style="s2">they own is uncontaminated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.700" end="00:57:21.620" style="s2">extremely difficult but I think with</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.490" end="00:57:24.560" style="s2">that as a goal state you know how hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.620" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">could it be right if we had that as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.560" end="00:57:28.460" style="s2">general awareness of why in the future I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:31.280" style="s2">want to live life for nothing that I own</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.460" end="00:57:34.250" style="s2">was made by slaves and it should all be</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.280" end="00:57:36.800" style="s2">you know permanent use doesn&#39;t degrade</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.250" end="00:57:41.030" style="s2">you know all the rest that stuff it</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.800" end="00:57:42.680" style="s2">seems doable it&#39;s not doable easily but</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.030" end="00:57:44.180" style="s2">it&#39;s also doable incrementally right</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.680" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">like what you do for clothing when we do</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.180" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">this for clothing okay that&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.249" end="00:57:54.460" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.619" end="00:57:59.869" style="s2">fumbling for something here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.460" end="00:58:03.650" style="s2">it&#39;s the drawing of the line so you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.869" end="00:58:04.970" style="s2">have people that really care are able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.650" end="00:58:08.029" style="s2">live in a way per their world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.970" end="00:58:09.559" style="s2">contaminated like right now it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.029" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">matter how much you care we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.559" end="00:58:14.539" style="s2">any of the social infrastructure to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:18.829" style="s2">it possible to turn caring into not do</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.539" end="00:58:21.499" style="s2">it yes exactly and I really want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.829" end="00:58:23.539" style="s2">caring into doing and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.499" end="00:58:25.489" style="s2">systems are focused on like global or</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.539" end="00:58:27.589" style="s2">like all of Canada or go to the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.489" end="00:58:31.519" style="s2">market I&#39;m like I can&#39;t and I it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.589" end="00:58:33.859" style="s2">something I can do create something that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.519" end="00:58:36.200" style="s2">is a bulk buying Club for 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.859" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">that is how do we get our food needs met</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.200" end="00:58:40.999" style="s2">that is how do we get our clothing needs</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:42.859" style="s2">met without demanding everyone you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.999" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">wears the same black shirt everyone wear</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.859" end="00:58:48.349" style="s2">it has this exact vegan diet that like</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:52.130" style="s2">how do i lessen mine and as soon as</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.130" end="00:58:55.940" style="s2">board because they do but asking them to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.049" end="00:58:58.069" style="s2">take their head out of the sand look</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.940" end="00:59:00.349" style="s2">around in all the chaos and when</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.349" end="00:59:04.730" style="s2">and so I think that 10,000 rows can get</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.140" end="00:59:06.410" style="s2">together we care deeply and create</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.730" end="00:59:09.410" style="s2">something beautiful that people want to</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.180" end="01:02:45.009" style="s2">the ten thousand for every solutions</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.430" end="01:02:46.749" style="s2">raising for every item start off with</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.009" end="01:02:49.180" style="s2">the buyers club because people like to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.749" end="01:02:51.099" style="s2">think that they get in something right I</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.180" end="01:02:52.690" style="s2">mean that might be a way to but then we</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.099" end="01:02:54.369" style="s2">don&#39;t have a buyers club yet we would</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.690" end="01:02:56.200" style="s2">need to create a website that is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.369" end="01:03:00.700" style="s2">buyers club or a Facebook Graph and if</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.200" end="01:03:02.470" style="s2">the buyers club you&#39;ll process raising</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.700" end="01:03:04.809" style="s2">conversations right that are going on</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.470" end="01:03:07.059" style="s2">the the the buyers club that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.809" end="01:03:09.099" style="s2">that&#39;s your attraction to 10,000 right</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.059" end="01:03:11.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s and it makes sense the ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.099" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">thousand threshold now makes sense right</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.140" end="01:03:15.910" style="s2">because you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a number</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:17.799" style="s2">where we feel we have sufficient buying</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.910" end="01:03:20.380" style="s2">power to negotiate deals and have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.799" end="01:03:22.089" style="s2">positive impact on ethical manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.380" end="01:03:24.489" style="s2">you know what I mean and and and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.089" end="01:03:26.829" style="s2">know ten thousand people each putting in</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.489" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">ten dollars a month that&#39;s $100,000 a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.829" end="01:03:31.569" style="s2">month of buying power like the buyers</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:33.249" style="s2">club has for whatever the it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.569" end="01:03:35.319" style="s2">that they that they collectively decide</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.249" end="01:03:37.719" style="s2">they want and then voting makes sense as</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.319" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">well right because you know 60% both or</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.719" end="01:03:40.719" style="s2">something well the other 40% don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:42.519" style="s2">to have that good they can have a future</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.719" end="01:03:45.729" style="s2">one right there credit remains in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.519" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">pool but the next I or something like</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.729" end="01:04:01.509" style="s2">that I mean it solves really a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:04:03.009" style="s2">your thousand people that can stop the</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.509" end="01:04:04.599" style="s2">recording because I have to I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.009" end="01:04:05.859" style="s2">have to go right away so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.599" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">end the recording next week we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.859" end="01:04:09.430" style="s2">start holding these on zoom&#39; and we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:12.130" style="s2">continue talking after I&#39;ve stopped the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.430" end="01:04:13.390" style="s2">recording but we&#39;re gonna hold these on</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.130" end="01:04:15.219" style="s2">zoom&#39; so that we can break out into</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.390" end="01:04:16.869" style="s2">groups and come up with solution for</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.219" end="01:04:18.329" style="s2">other ones and if anyone wants to move</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.869" end="01:04:20.650" style="s2">forward with creating a buyer&#39;s club</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.329" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">buyers club they are more than welcome</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.650" end="01:04:24.609" style="s2">to do that that is not my focus just</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.339" style="s2">because I am focused on creating this</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.609" end="01:04:28.380" style="s2">process for 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.339" end="01:04:31.229" style="s2">but anyone&#39;s welcome to use these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.380" end="01:04:36.019" style="s2">or those raisins of their own to come up</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.229" end="01:04:36.019" style="s2">with ideas highly fun</p>
