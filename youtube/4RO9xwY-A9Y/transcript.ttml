<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:25.550" style="s2">interested in this topic I really like</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.099" style="s2">nerding out about it so it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.550" end="00:02:30.459" style="s2">cool there&#39;s other people interested a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.099" end="00:02:33.049" style="s2">bit by myself I&#39;m a PhD candidate at</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.459" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">Queen&#39;s University in Ontario Canada and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.049" end="00:02:37.099" style="s2">I study Epictetus there so I study</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:41.269" style="s2">stoicism I&#39;m doing a PhD in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.099" end="00:02:43.310" style="s2">and specifically what I study is I study</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.269" end="00:02:46.579" style="s2">moral education in ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.310" end="00:02:49.269" style="s2">philosophy specifically in epictetus but</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.579" end="00:02:51.500" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested in this question</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.269" end="00:02:53.720" style="s2">so you didn&#39;t think of a lot of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.500" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">as being concerned with what is good and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.720" end="00:02:57.829" style="s2">what is bad and was right and wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:59.780" style="s2">I&#39;m more so interested in this question</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.829" end="00:03:01.579" style="s2">of moral education which is like given</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.780" end="00:03:03.829" style="s2">that we have an established theory of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.579" end="00:03:06.049" style="s2">what is Right wrong how do we transform</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.829" end="00:03:09.140" style="s2">ourselves to be the kind of people that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.049" end="00:03:10.760" style="s2">can act successfully on our</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.140" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">understanding right wrong and good and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.760" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">bad so not so much this question of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:16.940" style="s2">virtue is but this question of how do I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.069" style="s2">go about cultivating virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.940" end="00:03:20.540" style="s2">transforming myself and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.069" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">that&#39;s just a much more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.540" end="00:03:26.750" style="s2">question it was a question that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:29.989" style="s2">lost interest in in contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.750" end="00:03:31.910" style="s2">philosophy but was really at the forint</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.989" end="00:03:35.090" style="s2">drip philosophy this idea of self</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.910" end="00:03:36.859" style="s2">transformation and a lot of the times</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.090" end="00:03:38.750" style="s2">when we engage in ethics and engage in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.859" end="00:03:42.220" style="s2">philosophy it can be easy to lose sight</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.750" end="00:03:42.220" style="s2">of that and what makes up</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:49.640" style="s2">this special it was he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:51.170" style="s2">teeth her right so he actually taught</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.640" end="00:03:53.870" style="s2">stoic philosophy and what we have from</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.170" end="00:03:56.599" style="s2">him as we have from him an outline of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.870" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">how a program of moral education would</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.599" end="00:04:01.069" style="s2">function and work so I&#39;m gonna talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">bit about that program the three kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.069" end="00:04:05.269" style="s2">areas of study the three top point and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:09.819" style="s2">three disciplines sometimes been called</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.269" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">and how trainee min and those would look</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:15.250" style="s2">great yeah so I guess questions are at</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:17.239" style="s2">the end so we&#39;ll just get started</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:18.440" style="s2">so--but I&#39;m gonna assume everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.239" end="00:04:20.030" style="s2">kind of working background and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.440" end="00:04:21.979" style="s2">stoicism will try to fill some things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.030" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll go from there and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.979" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">trying to do this in a way where it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:29.000" style="s2">be applicable or interesting for those</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.220" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">who don&#39;t agree with stoicism value that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.000" end="00:04:33.289" style="s2">the only thing that matters is what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:35.150" style="s2">up to us or the only good and bad is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.289" end="00:04:37.220" style="s2">virtue advice and try to look at some</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.150" end="00:04:39.229" style="s2">ways of working this program in for</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.220" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">people with different value systems as</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.229" end="00:04:44.930" style="s2">well great so the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:47.389" style="s2">epictetus is program moral education</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.930" end="00:04:50.289" style="s2">divides into three portions and each</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.389" end="00:04:52.190" style="s2">portion needs to be mastered</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.289" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">sequentially so they can be all be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.190" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">studied but you need to master the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">before you can master the second before</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:59.000" style="s2">you can master the third and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.080" end="00:05:01.789" style="s2">after the mastering of all three to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.000" end="00:05:05.410" style="s2">achieved virtue and become you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.789" end="00:05:09.050" style="s2">sages and and virtuous wise individuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.410" end="00:05:10.490" style="s2">so these kind of go in a progressing</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.050" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">order so beginning with the first one</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.490" end="00:05:16.700" style="s2">this is the one that is famously</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">corresponds to physics which is about</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.700" end="00:05:19.490" style="s2">the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.560" style="s2">but really what epictetus talks about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.490" end="00:05:23.780" style="s2">being it&#39;s about mastering desire and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.560" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">aversion and what desire and aversion</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.780" end="00:05:29.080" style="s2">are are those are the strongest impulses</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:31.789" style="s2">that we feel they&#39;re the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.080" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">emotional or physiological responses we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.789" end="00:05:38.220" style="s2">feel towards things and what epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">points out is that desire and aversion</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.220" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">correspond to value judgments about good</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:45.480" style="s2">and bad right so good as we think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:46.950" style="s2">good as being the best kind of thing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.480" end="00:05:50.370" style="s2">thing that always benefits us this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.950" end="00:05:51.930" style="s2">like a technical term and then bad as</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:55.500" style="s2">being the worst kind thing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.930" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">that always harms us so desire and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.500" end="00:05:59.760" style="s2">aversion are these feelings that we feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">that correspond to these two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.760" end="00:06:05.040" style="s2">value judgments and when you begin life</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:07.950" style="s2">and you don&#39;t begin like studying</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.040" end="00:06:11.370" style="s2">philosophy you develop these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.950" end="00:06:14.940" style="s2">value judgments unintentionally and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.370" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">uninformed and then what happens is you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.940" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">end up suffering or being at the mercy</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.190" end="00:06:22.890" style="s2">of these emotional physiological</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">responses because you view the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.890" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">kinds of things as being good and bad so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:29.910" style="s2">the way to master designer version is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">epictetus fezzes not to not feel desired</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.910" end="00:06:32.910" style="s2">average it&#39;s not to be apathetic but</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.910" end="00:06:38.520" style="s2">the correct kinds of things and so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:40.530" style="s2">ask that the start of philosophy is we</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.520" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">want to be intentional about our value</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.530" end="00:06:44.040" style="s2">system we want to be intentional about</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">what we view is good and bad and what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.040" end="00:06:48.450" style="s2">feel desire an aversion for what we feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:51.480" style="s2">pulled towards what we feel drawn away</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.450" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">from so we recognize this we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.480" end="00:06:56.520" style="s2">live intentionally and then what we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">is we mean next thing we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.520" end="00:07:02.310" style="s2">actually suspend our judgments so we go</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:04.260" style="s2">from people who function assuming things</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.310" end="00:07:05.729" style="s2">are good and bad function feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.260" end="00:07:07.590" style="s2">designer versions and passions that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.729" end="00:07:09.390" style="s2">correspond to that anger and when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.590" end="00:07:12.919" style="s2">think something wrongs us or happiness</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.390" end="00:07:12.919" style="s2">when you think something benefits us and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.690" style="s2">we take a step back from that because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.590" end="00:07:20.070" style="s2">when we&#39;re in this mode this would</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.690" end="00:07:22.680" style="s2">epictetus this is why it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.070" end="00:07:25.200" style="s2">area of study is desires and aversions</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.680" end="00:07:28.580" style="s2">when they&#39;re frustrated they correspond</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.200" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">to passions and passions</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.580" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">interrupts our capacity to reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.100" style="s2">properly so if you&#39;re an untrained</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:36.660" style="s2">person just beginning your philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.100" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">journey and you&#39;re starting to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.660" end="00:07:40.500" style="s2">well you know what kind of philosophy do</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:43.200" style="s2">I agree in agree with how do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.500" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">live your passions are going to pull you</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.200" end="00:07:47.099" style="s2">around and they&#39;re going to disrupt your</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:49.790" style="s2">capacity to reason so the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.099" end="00:07:52.670" style="s2">do is we suspend our judgments</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.790" end="00:07:55.310" style="s2">then we take a step back and go okay I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.670" end="00:07:56.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know what good and bad is and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:07:58.850" style="s2">the next thing we do is we look for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.990" end="00:08:01.850" style="s2">standard a way to test that in a way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.850" end="00:08:04.550" style="s2">evaluate that a way to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.850" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">world around us and so for epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.550" end="00:08:08.480" style="s2">this is stoic philosophy but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:10.850" style="s2">this is good advice for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.480" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">whatever philosophy that would be you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.850" end="00:08:13.850" style="s2">take a step back to the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">of philosophy is I want to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.850" end="00:08:17.600" style="s2">intentionally and I want to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">correctly it&#39;s the very beginning then</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.600" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">the next thing you do is you take a step</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.700" style="s2">back and you say well I hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:24.890" style="s2">living attention correctly so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.700" end="00:08:26.930" style="s2">know and in a position of ignorance so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.890" end="00:08:29.900" style="s2">take a step back from my commitments</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.930" end="00:08:32.300" style="s2">from my value judgments and I look for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.900" end="00:08:34.940" style="s2">way to make sense of the world I look</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.300" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">for a way to evaluate the world and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.940" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">you end up doing is is you either take</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:41.419" style="s2">up stoicism you&#39;re taking about Kurian</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:43.570" style="s2">ISM or a civilian ISM or some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.419" end="00:08:46.340" style="s2">contemporary method of value</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:48.500" style="s2">consequentialism utilitarianism the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.340" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">ontology you find some way of making</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.500" end="00:08:52.100" style="s2">sense of the world and evaluating good</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.270" end="00:08:55.580" style="s2">of that good and bad things and good and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.100" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">bad actions and then what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.580" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">take that standard and you carefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">apply it to the world around you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.470" end="00:09:06.050" style="s2">cautiously intentionally and one at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:07.310" style="s2">time so you do is you take a step back</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.050" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">from your value judgments you enter a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.310" end="00:09:12.700" style="s2">state of ignorance and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:15.710" style="s2">one-by-one reintegrate objects</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.700" end="00:09:17.270" style="s2">situations people and yuria valuate them</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.710" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">with this standard with this philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.270" end="00:09:21.050" style="s2">that you&#39;ve developed this in epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">this program this is stoic Theory stoic</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.050" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2">philosophy things that are good is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:28.370" style="s2">virtue and things that are bad is vice</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:31.010" style="s2">and you you apply that judgment to all</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.370" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">objects situations types of things you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.010" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">pursued in the past types of things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:37.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve been afraid of in the past like</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:40.910" style="s2">death or like well for popularity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.850" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">you go about reintegrating these objects</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.910" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">into your life carefully and one by one</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:48.140" style="s2">and the point with this is this is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:52.550" style="s2">this has to be the starting point of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.140" end="00:09:55.010" style="s2">philosophy because until we do this we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.550" end="00:09:56.900" style="s2">are just going to be disrupted by our</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.010" end="00:10:01.010" style="s2">passions in a way that like if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.900" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">skip this step and you you skip</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.010" end="00:10:05.490" style="s2">taking a position of ignorance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">slowly building and you just try to act</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.490" end="00:10:09.510" style="s2">on what you would you endorse in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:12.090" style="s2">of theory your passions are gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.510" end="00:10:13.380" style="s2">disrupt at that capacity and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.090" end="00:10:15.960" style="s2">gonna be able to act on what you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.380" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">is with you which you take in theory to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.960" end="00:10:21.840" style="s2">be the right thing so taking a step back</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:23.850" style="s2">from this what I think the call for here</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.840" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">is is the first step of philosophy is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.850" end="00:10:29.340" style="s2">recognize that your your value systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">and your beliefs influence your</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.340" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">motivations and influence your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:37.530" style="s2">in your passionate States right so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">take that so then we say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.530" end="00:10:42.750" style="s2">better to have no beliefs than to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">harmful beliefs and wrong beliefs so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.750" end="00:10:46.350" style="s2">what we do is we move from the state we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">a recognition that our beliefs influence</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.350" end="00:10:50.430" style="s2">our motivations and our emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:53.160" style="s2">and then the next part of stoic training</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.430" end="00:10:55.590" style="s2">is to do a schema skeptical and ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.160" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">position and then what we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.590" end="00:11:00.660" style="s2">carefully one-by-one reintegrate beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:06.170" style="s2">and reintegrate things into our value</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.660" end="00:11:08.280" style="s2">system so this is the first step</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.170" end="00:11:10.590" style="s2">mastering of desire and aversion is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.280" end="00:11:12.270" style="s2">Epictetus says and what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.590" end="00:11:14.010" style="s2">really interesting about this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.270" end="00:11:16.530" style="s2">just a call it&#39;s a call to live</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.010" end="00:11:19.290" style="s2">intentionally and it&#39;s a call that a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.530" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">flawed value system can be more harmful</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.290" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">than than nothing and I think that works</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:25.290" style="s2">no matter your value system or no matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:28.830" style="s2">if you don&#39;t agree with stone philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.290" end="00:11:32.400" style="s2">all the way and then once we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.830" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">that we should hopefully be motivated</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.400" end="00:11:37.080" style="s2">with extremely strong passionate</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:38.370" style="s2">producing emotions only towards the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.080" end="00:11:39.450" style="s2">kinds of things that we actually view is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.370" end="00:11:42.870" style="s2">good and the kinds of things that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.450" end="00:11:45.180" style="s2">actually view is bad and this is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.870" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">and that would be the state of mastery</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.180" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">desire and aversion which takes time and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:49.890" style="s2">takes work but that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:52.770" style="s2">at so we&#39;re looking to get to so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.890" end="00:11:57.000" style="s2">state were you know in a stoic terms I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.770" end="00:11:58.790" style="s2">not I&#39;m aggrieved by a sense of by a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.000" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">fear of death I&#39;m not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.790" end="00:12:02.520" style="s2">allowing me or preventing me from doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:04.260" style="s2">the kinds of things I want to do I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.520" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">being tempted or coerced by other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.260" end="00:12:10.350" style="s2">who are threatening me because my states</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:12.620" style="s2">of passions and emotions are under</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.350" end="00:12:13.880" style="s2">control so</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.620" end="00:12:15.140" style="s2">I do this in 20 minutes when we move</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.880" end="00:12:17.630" style="s2">ahead to the next one and they will talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.140" end="00:12:19.550" style="s2">on flesh these out a bit further so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.630" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">after you design a master designer and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.550" end="00:12:23.330" style="s2">version that&#39;s the first step so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:25.400" style="s2">assume you assume a sceptical position</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.330" end="00:12:27.140" style="s2">you take on some sort of theory or some</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.400" end="00:12:29.270" style="s2">sort of philosophy you apply it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.140" end="00:12:30.710" style="s2">carefully concerning things that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.270" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">good and bad not so very strong things</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.710" end="00:12:34.700" style="s2">that are really really good and really</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:38.270" style="s2">really bad then what we&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.700" end="00:12:40.250" style="s2">there after what we are motivated</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.270" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">towards is what corresponds with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.250" end="00:12:42.340" style="s2">good or what we take to be good and vice</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.340" end="00:12:49.130" style="s2">we still need a way to navigate things</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.070" end="00:12:51.230" style="s2">that are less good so we needed a way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.130" end="00:12:53.840" style="s2">navigate in the stoical sense this would</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.230" end="00:12:55.520" style="s2">be how do we navigate a difference how</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.840" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">do we navigate our obligations the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.520" end="00:13:02.570" style="s2">things that are not virtue in Vice in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:04.850" style="s2">other senses this would just be you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.570" end="00:13:06.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken what my core value system is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.850" end="00:13:09.050" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.770" end="00:13:10.970" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s obligations to other</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.050" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">people perhaps that&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.970" end="00:13:18.170" style="s2">deontological content picture or</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:19.310" style="s2">something like this and then I well what</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.170" end="00:13:22.220" style="s2">do I do about these kind of in-between</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.310" end="00:13:23.810" style="s2">states that don&#39;t seem to correspond</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.220" end="00:13:27.260" style="s2">immediately or how do i how do I fill</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.810" end="00:13:28.940" style="s2">these out and stoicism this would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.260" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">like how do I flesh out if I know I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.940" end="00:13:31.700" style="s2">to be virtuous and I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:33.500" style="s2">vicious how do I flesh out now my</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.700" end="00:13:36.910" style="s2">obligations to other people my</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.500" end="00:13:41.210" style="s2">obligations to my community to my body</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.910" end="00:13:43.940" style="s2">what how I should act and all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.210" end="00:13:46.010" style="s2">other in-between cases okay so the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.940" end="00:13:48.830" style="s2">thing we do is we master our strong</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.010" end="00:13:53.990" style="s2">desires and fears and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.830" end="00:13:56.360" style="s2">thing we do is we move to fleshing out</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.990" end="00:13:58.730" style="s2">how we should act in specific in</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.360" end="00:14:02.030" style="s2">particular situations how we should act</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.730" end="00:14:05.300" style="s2">in specific contexts giving us value</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.030" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">system right and so for a big penis this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.300" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2">is mastering what he calls impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:11.810" style="s2">act an impulse not attack which is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:14.960" style="s2">gentler form of impulse and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.810" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">this is the area which is is corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.960" end="00:14:18.710" style="s2">to ethics who corresponds to particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:21.260" style="s2">actions the first one corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.710" end="00:14:23.510" style="s2">physics because it&#39;s about understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.260" end="00:14:25.840" style="s2">the way the world is what do I take to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.510" end="00:14:27.910" style="s2">be good can take to be bad and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.840" end="00:14:29.140" style="s2">this is ethics as in given that this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.910" end="00:14:31.300" style="s2">good and this is bad and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.140" end="00:14:33.250" style="s2">value system I&#39;ve adopted how now do I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.300" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">act how now do i fulfill my obligations</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.250" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">to other people and other situations</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">and for epictetus I mean this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.290" end="00:14:46.170" style="s2">stoic picture they&#39;re very much</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:49.630" style="s2">connected to this picture of of nature</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.170" end="00:14:52.389" style="s2">right so so appealing to nature and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.630" end="00:14:56.110" style="s2">following our nature and that penis has</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.389" end="00:14:57.819" style="s2">this picture of stoic rules so this</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.110" end="00:14:59.800" style="s2">means is when I when I want to figure</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.819" end="00:15:02.889" style="s2">out how I should act in situations what</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">I do is I appeal to different roles that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.889" end="00:15:08.529" style="s2">I have and different kinds of rules that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">form a hierarchy so at the very top of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.529" end="00:15:14.019" style="s2">the hierarchy what I have is I have my</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:17.589" style="s2">universal rule as a human being so when</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.019" end="00:15:20.139" style="s2">I&#39;m considering how I should act I never</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.589" end="00:15:23.079" style="s2">act in a way that conflicts with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.139" end="00:15:24.819" style="s2">universal rule as a human being and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.079" end="00:15:27.190" style="s2">universal rule has some implications so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.819" end="00:15:29.649" style="s2">one of the implications is I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:31.750" style="s2">things that conflict with virtue I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.649" end="00:15:34.329" style="s2">do things that will be vicious but other</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.750" end="00:15:37.870" style="s2">obligations we have as a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.329" end="00:15:42.310" style="s2">to preserve our body right so I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.870" end="00:15:44.949" style="s2">not you know if virtue and vice are all</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.310" end="00:15:48.519" style="s2">that matters to me I&#39;m not harmed if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.949" end="00:15:50.860" style="s2">lose a hand in a substantial way but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.519" end="00:15:51.939" style="s2">it&#39;s still quite strange I still would</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.860" end="00:15:54.579" style="s2">not want to be the kind of person who</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.939" end="00:15:58.449" style="s2">selects to like self mutilate or selects</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.579" end="00:16:00.579" style="s2">to harm my body so when I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.449" end="00:16:01.899" style="s2">how to how to navigate particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.579" end="00:16:04.660" style="s2">situations in particular ethical</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.899" end="00:16:06.540" style="s2">situations what we do is we appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.660" end="00:16:08.949" style="s2">our roles first of all as that as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:11.769" style="s2">universal role as a human being our</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.949" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">universal role as as an animal and as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.769" end="00:16:18.790" style="s2">rational animal and that means we we act</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:21.160" style="s2">rationally and we respect our body and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.790" end="00:16:22.689" style="s2">our physical health when we can and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.160" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">the next way there&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.689" end="00:16:25.660" style="s2">hierarchy and we keep going through it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:28.209" style="s2">the next thing we do is we appeal to our</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.660" end="00:16:31.089" style="s2">particular capacities so we appeal to we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.209" end="00:16:34.060" style="s2">appeal to our particular talents so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.089" end="00:16:38.290" style="s2">could conflict against our nature if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.060" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">know you&#39;re trying to be kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.290" end="00:16:43.209" style="s2">person you&#39;re not so you&#39;re trying in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:45.399" style="s2">your ethical pursuit to become an</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.209" end="00:16:47.490" style="s2">extroverted person when you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.399" end="00:16:50.540" style="s2">fundamentally an introverted person or</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.490" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to like things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.540" end="00:16:54.260" style="s2">just don&#39;t fit with with your with your</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:55.220" style="s2">nature and your capacity and your</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.260" end="00:16:57.170" style="s2">dispositions</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.220" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">so what Epictetus would say here is in</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.170" end="00:17:02.210" style="s2">these kind of situations just just</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:04.790" style="s2">honestly appeal and reflect to your</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.210" end="00:17:06.470" style="s2">capacities in your your physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.790" end="00:17:09.610" style="s2">disposition and use that as information</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.470" end="00:17:12.200" style="s2">and navigate specific situations</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.610" end="00:17:14.840" style="s2">the next thing we do that we can appeal</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.200" end="00:17:17.430" style="s2">to is we can appeal to our specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.840" end="00:17:19.870" style="s2">relationships with other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.430" end="00:17:22.450" style="s2">so we appeal to our universal rule is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.870" end="00:17:24.910" style="s2">human being we appeal to our particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.450" end="00:17:26.380" style="s2">rule which is our capacity our certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.910" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">capacities maybe we&#39;re born with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.380" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">certain disposition maybe we like logic</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:35.590" style="s2">we like bath maybe we like music</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re social and we follow along</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.590" end="00:17:38.770" style="s2">those two tell us how to act and how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">structure and how to get our life and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.770" end="00:17:43.390" style="s2">the next thing you do is you look to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:45.340" style="s2">your rules in terms of your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.390" end="00:17:47.410" style="s2">with other human beings so you look to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.340" end="00:17:51.400" style="s2">you say well am i and my mother and my</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.410" end="00:17:54.460" style="s2">father am i a friend so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.400" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">and you flesh out that and you develop</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.460" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">that and so then now we start to get a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:04.460" style="s2">picture of how this is kind of a program</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:07.340" style="s2">that has to progress sequentially so</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.460" end="00:18:08.420" style="s2">one thing like one example that BTS uses</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.340" end="00:18:09.650" style="s2">and he loves these examples and one that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.420" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">I think&#39;s really interesting is he uses</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">the example of a of a father who is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.600" end="00:18:19.969" style="s2">able to care for his daughters sick</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:22.099" style="s2">right and he runs away from his daughter</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.969" end="00:18:24.259" style="s2">he leaves the house he can&#39;t handle the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.099" end="00:18:26.149" style="s2">fact that his daughter might die and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.259" end="00:18:29.659" style="s2">picture here or the ID here in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.149" end="00:18:31.339" style="s2">situation is that this is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.659" end="00:18:33.409" style="s2">has not mastered desire and aversion</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.339" end="00:18:35.929" style="s2">this is someone who has not mastered the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.409" end="00:18:37.999" style="s2">first area of study they think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.929" end="00:18:40.069" style="s2">death is a bad thing they&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.999" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">their daughter dying they haven&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.069" end="00:18:44.929" style="s2">to terms with what their alternate value</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:48.319" style="s2">system should be under a stoic picture</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.929" end="00:18:50.149" style="s2">and because of that that&#39;s interfering</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.319" end="00:18:51.469" style="s2">with their capacity to fulfill their</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.149" end="00:18:53.059" style="s2">obligation to other people he&#39;s not able</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.469" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">to fulfill his obligation as a father</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.059" end="00:18:58.489" style="s2">because he&#39;s still afraid so we work</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:01.699" style="s2">sequentially like this we master desire</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.489" end="00:19:03.649" style="s2">and aversion and then we move to our</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.699" end="00:19:05.209" style="s2">obligations to specific people and our</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.649" end="00:19:07.609" style="s2">relationships and specific people our</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.209" end="00:19:09.859" style="s2">relationships with ourselves and our</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.609" end="00:19:11.269" style="s2">specific capacities and then the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.859" end="00:19:13.819" style="s2">way to reflect how to structure our</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.269" end="00:19:15.169" style="s2">lives is just choice and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.819" end="00:19:17.089" style="s2">thing I like about epic tedious and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.169" end="00:19:20.359" style="s2">like about stoicism is at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.089" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">day if it doesn&#39;t conflict with reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.359" end="00:19:26.019" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t go against um you&#39;re each</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.219" style="s2">reserving being it doesn&#39;t go against</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.019" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">your relation up betraying your</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.219" end="00:19:32.149" style="s2">relationship with other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:34.159" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be some choices you make</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.149" end="00:19:39.049" style="s2">in life which are just a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.159" end="00:19:41.449" style="s2">choice just a matter of how you how you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.049" end="00:19:42.649" style="s2">choose choose to live so whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.449" end="00:19:44.809" style="s2">you go into one career or another</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.649" end="00:19:46.669" style="s2">whether or not you pursue one path or</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.809" end="00:19:48.829" style="s2">another there&#39;s ultimately a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.669" end="00:19:50.299" style="s2">is just up to you and I like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.829" end="00:19:52.969" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this ethical system that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.299" end="00:19:55.009" style="s2">leaves space for that being a creative</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.969" end="00:19:56.419" style="s2">endeavor and not something that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.009" end="00:20:00.649" style="s2">there&#39;s not necessarily going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.419" end="00:20:03.169" style="s2">wrong answer in that regard and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.649" end="00:20:05.059" style="s2">last system so going through this in</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.169" end="00:20:06.709" style="s2">order then once we&#39;re in a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.059" end="00:20:08.749" style="s2">position with that we move on to logic</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.709" end="00:20:10.459" style="s2">and this is the last system which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.749" end="00:20:14.119" style="s2">just how to reason properly and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.459" end="00:20:18.679" style="s2">here is once we&#39;ve mastered desire and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.119" end="00:20:20.119" style="s2">aversion so reviewing now really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.679" end="00:20:23.010" style="s2">is trying to fit a lot here in to 20</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.119" end="00:20:24.090" style="s2">minutes reviewing now we</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.010" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">say look I want to live intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.090" end="00:20:27.660" style="s2">with intentional value system I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:30.290" style="s2">recognize that I&#39;m ignorant and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.660" end="00:20:33.060" style="s2">ignorance is harming you so I backup I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.290" end="00:20:34.350" style="s2">adopt a sceptical position I find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.060" end="00:20:35.880" style="s2">philosophy that fits for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.350" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">this is epictetus is beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.880" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">philosophy then from there once I find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:42.360" style="s2">value system that fits for me I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:45.210" style="s2">reconsider specific objects in relation</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.360" end="00:20:47.250" style="s2">to that value system you know what now</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.210" end="00:20:50.100" style="s2">does death mean to me what now does</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.250" end="00:20:53.820" style="s2">popularity mean to me what now does my</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.100" end="00:20:55.230" style="s2">career mean to me in relation to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.820" end="00:20:57.420" style="s2">standard of judgment I&#39;ve been giving in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.230" end="00:20:59.220" style="s2">the case of so it means they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.420" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">or bad because only virtual advice are</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.220" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">good and bad once we have that picture</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.460" style="s2">in place then we move to this question</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:07.140" style="s2">of how am I supposed to act in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.460" end="00:21:09.270" style="s2">particular situations how am I supposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.140" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">to act given this picture of good and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.270" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">bad given how am I supposed to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:18.990" style="s2">particular situations and as epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">asked us to appeal essentially to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.990" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">way the world is and appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:26.970" style="s2">information about who we are naturally</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:29.430" style="s2">as rational animals who we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.970" end="00:21:32.280" style="s2">specifically as people with certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.430" end="00:21:34.500" style="s2">talents and capacities and who we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.280" end="00:21:36.150" style="s2">enter personally as members of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.500" end="00:21:38.250" style="s2">communities and people with</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.150" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">relationships to other people and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">from there anything that doesn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.630" end="00:21:44.670" style="s2">into those three steps can just be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:46.020" style="s2">creative can just be it can just uh you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.670" end="00:21:48.210" style="s2">can just pick you can just decide the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.020" end="00:21:50.250" style="s2">kind of life you want to live and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.210" end="00:21:51.660" style="s2">the last system is logic so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.250" end="00:21:54.270" style="s2">with logic is once I&#39;m in that position</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.660" end="00:21:56.430" style="s2">I want to cement that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.270" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">cement that way of thinking such that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.430" end="00:22:01.110" style="s2">don&#39;t fall out of it Epictetus is talks</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:03.270" style="s2">about cementing to the point where even</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.110" end="00:22:06.330" style="s2">if you&#39;re drunk or even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.270" end="00:22:07.950" style="s2">depressed or you fall into a manic state</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.330" end="00:22:10.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to deviate from this</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.950" end="00:22:12.420" style="s2">kind of knowledge and this was for him</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.680" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">was just the way of doing this was just</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.420" end="00:22:17.850" style="s2">actually just studying logic studying</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:19.710" style="s2">formal ways of fear of thinking studying</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.850" end="00:22:23.100" style="s2">kind of logical fallacies the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.710" end="00:22:25.230" style="s2">falling to and the main takeaway from</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.100" end="00:22:27.300" style="s2">logic I would say there&#39;s two main</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.230" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">takeaways one is accenting cautiously</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.300" end="00:22:33.000" style="s2">and intentionally so cultivating and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:34.800" style="s2">developing a mindfulness of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.000" end="00:22:36.220" style="s2">situation your surroundings and the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.800" end="00:22:37.809" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.220" end="00:22:40.840" style="s2">so that you&#39;re not forming beliefs or</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.809" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">judgments unintentionally and the second</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.840" end="00:22:45.669" style="s2">way of doing it is to the second big</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:47.980" style="s2">part of logic is assuming facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.669" end="00:22:50.049" style="s2">consistency so what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.980" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">consistency and he has these two parts I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.049" end="00:22:54.870" style="s2">wrote down here in our study of logic we</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:57.130" style="s2">need to work to accept the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.870" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">consequences of what has been properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.130" end="00:23:03.610" style="s2">derived so this is one thing that I work</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:05.950" style="s2">at if someone presents and reasons a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.610" end="00:23:07.809" style="s2">good argument working on being the kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.950" end="00:23:10.299" style="s2">of person that is responsive to reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.809" end="00:23:13.000" style="s2">so even if it doesn&#39;t fit your biases</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.299" end="00:23:15.549" style="s2">even if it doesn&#39;t fit what you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.000" end="00:23:17.289" style="s2">the conclusion to be responding well</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.549" end="00:23:20.289" style="s2">okay those premises lead to this</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.289" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">conclusion so I&#39;m going to follow and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.289" end="00:23:26.049" style="s2">and accept that conclusion and then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">second part is that is accepting that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.049" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">one&#39;s premises produce an absurd or</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:33.400" style="s2">necessary false conclusion you must</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:35.169" style="s2">re-examine the premises so the second</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.400" end="00:23:37.900" style="s2">idea of this is that if your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.169" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">lead to an inconsistency or if your</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.900" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">beliefs lead to a problem doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:48.520" style="s2">to reevaluate those beliefs and doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:50.200" style="s2">the work to take a step back and think</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.520" end="00:23:52.990" style="s2">about how you arrive to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.200" end="00:23:56.620" style="s2">and I just think about this as like not</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.990" end="00:23:58.090" style="s2">being able to function in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.620" end="00:24:00.150" style="s2">cognitive dissonance not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.090" end="00:24:02.530" style="s2">function in a state where you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.150" end="00:24:05.320" style="s2">contradictory things simultaneously that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.530" end="00:24:06.940" style="s2">you believe becoming responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.320" end="00:24:08.440" style="s2">reason in the fact that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.940" end="00:24:10.419" style="s2">set of beliefs to contradict with</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.440" end="00:24:13.210" style="s2">another with one another that should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.419" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">motivating to the point where you reject</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.210" end="00:24:19.419" style="s2">one and and you seek once again to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:23.470" style="s2">achieve consistency and realign those</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.419" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">beliefs so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.470" end="00:24:26.530" style="s2">I try to there&#39;s just a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:28.059" style="s2">information there which I tried to cover</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.530" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">as quickly as possible and I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.059" end="00:24:32.440" style="s2">summarize it one more time but what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:35.080" style="s2">wanted to provide a picture of the main</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.440" end="00:24:37.330" style="s2">takeaway there was I think sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.080" end="00:24:40.690" style="s2">when we engage in stoicism it can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.330" end="00:24:42.970" style="s2">like taken as some just some helpful</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.690" end="00:24:44.620" style="s2">ideas or some concepts to work around</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.970" end="00:24:47.620" style="s2">and you think about the dichotomy of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.620" end="00:24:50.890" style="s2">control or you think about these other</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.620" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">concepts but there really was a system</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.890" end="00:24:54.909" style="s2">of following there really was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.120" end="00:24:56.260" style="s2">progression at least in Epictetus school</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.909" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">that was meant to be followed in order</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.260" end="00:25:01.150" style="s2">and there was a system that was meant to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:03.700" style="s2">be a lot of work and followed a specific</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.150" end="00:25:06.190" style="s2">system and I tried to flesh a bit out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.700" end="00:25:08.230" style="s2">what that was so the first was was</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.190" end="00:25:11.140" style="s2">working to master your strong emotions</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.230" end="00:25:13.350" style="s2">your passions by first assuming a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.140" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">skeptical state and then carefully</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.350" end="00:25:19.630" style="s2">re-evaluating things to be good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:21.640" style="s2">next once we&#39;ve done that learning to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.630" end="00:25:24.030" style="s2">responsive to information about who we</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.640" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">are generally as rational creatures</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.030" end="00:25:28.150" style="s2">particularly given our capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:29.260" style="s2">given our specific relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.150" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">other people and learning to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.260" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">responsive to those reasons when</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:36.429" style="s2">navigating specific situations and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">once we once you&#39;ve done that the third</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.429" end="00:25:47.020" style="s2">system of logic is learning - learning</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:48.820" style="s2">to be responsive to reason in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.020" end="00:25:50.669" style="s2">when you&#39;re having conversations when</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:53.530" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking if there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.669" end="00:25:54.730" style="s2">inconsistency evaluating where that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.530" end="00:25:56.679" style="s2">inconsistency is coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.730" end="00:26:00.250" style="s2">rejecting one of the premises or at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.679" end="00:26:03.549" style="s2">very least going back and reevaluating</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.250" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">them and if they&#39;re if the premises lead</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.549" end="00:26:10.299" style="s2">to a conclusion soundly accepting that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">conclusion even if it is not the one you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.299" end="00:26:15.789" style="s2">might want and the idea is definitely if</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">we progressively work on all three of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.789" end="00:26:20.260" style="s2">these we master these sequentially that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">was the picture of how stoic training</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.260" end="00:26:25.450" style="s2">was supposed to take place and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">we get there a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.450" end="00:26:28.659" style="s2">picture of like a fleshed-out school and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s worth like a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.659" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">of focusing on and developing so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">was a lot of information I tried try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:36.460" style="s2">throw it out there and maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:37.330" style="s2">flush stuff out more in the chat and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.460" end="00:26:39.790" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">so thank you mm-hmm yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.790" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:44.620" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s I like the idea of teasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:47.110" style="s2">out those different those different</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.620" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">sections so I&#39;m gonna ask Michael some</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.110" end="00:26:51.280" style="s2">questions right now to warm us up if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:53.770" style="s2">have any questions write it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.280" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">box and then I&#39;ll call on you and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.770" end="00:26:57.720" style="s2">can kind of unmute yourself or if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:27:01.570" style="s2">like me to read it just indicate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.720" end="00:27:03.310" style="s2">one thing I&#39;m curious it&#39;s somewhat a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.570" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">kind of a more personal question with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.310" end="00:27:07.570" style="s2">your relationship with stoicism but</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:09.700" style="s2">related to something you just said how</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.570" end="00:27:13.660" style="s2">did you find your way to stoicism how</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.700" end="00:27:15.310" style="s2">did they grip you personally and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.660" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">you mentioned something about you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.310" end="00:27:19.180" style="s2">you have to take this skeptical stance</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.180" style="s2">and then you find out what philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.180" end="00:27:24.340" style="s2">fits for you is there anything more you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.180" end="00:27:25.870" style="s2">can after that like how do you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.340" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">philosophy fits for you besides having</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.870" end="00:27:31.740" style="s2">that maybe that resonance with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:33.640" style="s2">great so I I&#39;m firmly of the belief that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.740" end="00:27:35.410" style="s2">intentional living is better than on</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.640" end="00:27:37.720" style="s2">intentional living like an examined life</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.410" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">is better than an unexamined life so</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.720" end="00:27:43.030" style="s2">what I would hate to do I also want the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:44.530" style="s2">position that I&#39;m pretty ignorant so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.030" end="00:27:46.030" style="s2">would hate to like meet someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.530" end="00:27:48.160" style="s2">like oh this is a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.030" end="00:27:49.690" style="s2">philosophy that works for me and be like</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.160" end="00:27:51.730" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong you should be a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.690" end="00:27:54.850" style="s2">you&#39;re ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">I&#39;m just not at that positioning yet so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.850" end="00:27:59.020" style="s2">for me what happened I think what what</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:02.020" style="s2">draws a lot of people to someone what</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.020" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">drew me to stoicism was I like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.020" end="00:28:05.980" style="s2">of accountability for the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.410" style="s2">your life so one of the core values of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.980" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">stoicism that I really like is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.410" end="00:28:13.660" style="s2">that the quality of your life is up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:15.880" style="s2">you it&#39;s not up to circumstances beyond</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.660" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">your control it&#39;s up to cultivating your</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.880" end="00:28:20.980" style="s2">own character I like what follows from</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:23.680" style="s2">that which is that every person has the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:27.010" style="s2">capacity for a good life every person</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.680" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">has the capacity you know if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.010" end="00:28:29.950" style="s2">picture that there&#39;s certain conditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:31.750" style="s2">required for a good life there some</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.950" end="00:28:34.420" style="s2">people just are just just have bad lives</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.750" end="00:28:36.970" style="s2">and will have bad locks um there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.420" end="00:28:39.490" style="s2">nothing that can be done about it and at</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.970" end="00:28:41.020" style="s2">least intuitively if we can develop any</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.490" end="00:28:43.150" style="s2">sort of system that saves us from that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.020" end="00:28:46.450" style="s2">claim I find it really appealing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.150" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">attractive and then another thing I like</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.450" end="00:28:51.190" style="s2">about is I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:56.200" style="s2">underestimate the role of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.190" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">you underestimate the role that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.200" end="00:29:04.180" style="s2">your disposition or the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.850" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">think about things and I what I like</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.180" end="00:29:09.070" style="s2">about stoicism like I&#39;m being drawn as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:11.110" style="s2">more towards Aristotelian ISM and other</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.070" end="00:29:12.570" style="s2">schools as I studied more or I liked</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.110" end="00:29:15.700" style="s2">what&#39;s awesome is it like</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.570" end="00:29:17.320" style="s2">unapologetically emphasizes virtue it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.700" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">says you know you can be happy on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.320" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">torture rack and it says like that is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">for a good life and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:28.180" style="s2">quite inspiring about that and I hope</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:32.860" style="s2">it&#39;s true it would be would be really</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.180" end="00:29:33.970" style="s2">nice if it is and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.860" end="00:29:37.060" style="s2">discovering the philosophy that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.970" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2">for you I think that as I said and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.060" end="00:29:41.830" style="s2">is part of what attracts me to moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:43.390" style="s2">education you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.830" end="00:29:44.860" style="s2">like if you&#39;re living with a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.390" end="00:29:46.360" style="s2">different moral system but you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.860" end="00:29:47.980" style="s2">your best every day to be good and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.360" end="00:29:49.750" style="s2">you&#39;re following intuitions and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.980" end="00:29:52.660" style="s2">living actively you&#39;re already in like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.750" end="00:29:55.390" style="s2">the top you know twenty ten percentile</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.660" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">of people like it really matters very</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.390" end="00:30:03.160" style="s2">little to me if if what you take feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:04.390" style="s2">ultimate ends is slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.160" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.390" end="00:30:09.160" style="s2">going to be wrong in any system of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:11.170" style="s2">murder or something like this or like</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.160" end="00:30:14.590" style="s2">unjust murder out of anger or something</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.170" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">but most ethical systems are quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.590" end="00:30:18.670" style="s2">similar in what they end up asking you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:20.200" style="s2">to do and kind of differ in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.670" end="00:30:23.260" style="s2">their justification for why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.200" end="00:30:25.740" style="s2">right thing to do um so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.260" end="00:30:28.020" style="s2">it&#39;s just like begin the journey and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.740" end="00:30:30.850" style="s2">open yourself up like Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.020" end="00:30:32.920" style="s2">talks about this and it&#39;s like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.850" end="00:30:34.660" style="s2">interested if I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.920" end="00:30:37.660" style="s2">truth you know if stoicism was wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.660" end="00:30:41.170" style="s2">would I would I would want to know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.660" end="00:30:42.580" style="s2">then learn that so be open in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.170" end="00:30:44.620" style="s2">journey also for other possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.580" end="00:30:46.420" style="s2">like I&#39;m very cautious I like stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.620" end="00:30:48.160" style="s2">it helps me be a better person but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.420" end="00:30:50.310" style="s2">cautious of you know I consider myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.160" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">practicing stoic of attaching too</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.310" end="00:30:58.600" style="s2">strongly to it as a label and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:31:00.760" style="s2">mentioned your practice of stoic and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.600" end="00:31:02.200" style="s2">know you do jujitsu and you became known</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.760" end="00:31:05.140" style="s2">for that like the stoic guy who does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.200" end="00:31:07.150" style="s2">Jitsu could you maybe speak</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.140" end="00:31:09.790" style="s2">how jujitsu fits in your practice of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.150" end="00:31:11.010" style="s2">stoicism and how you practice stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.790" end="00:31:15.280" style="s2">in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.010" end="00:31:21.250" style="s2">yeah so in terms of practicing stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.280" end="00:31:24.280" style="s2">I think that I think one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.250" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">ways so Epictetus talks about he says</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.280" end="00:31:31.809" style="s2">suspend your judgment and then what</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:34.330" style="s2">happens is you encounter new situations</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.809" end="00:31:39.160" style="s2">and then you apply stoic theory to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.330" end="00:31:41.230" style="s2">situation so you you suspend your</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.160" end="00:31:42.309" style="s2">judgment you encounter new situation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:44.620" style="s2">your supposed to evaluate it and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.309" end="00:31:45.790" style="s2">things will correctly you go you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.620" end="00:31:47.410" style="s2">these people are laughing at me it</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.790" end="00:31:48.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter to me you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.410" end="00:31:51.400" style="s2">have anything to do with vice and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.750" end="00:31:54.130" style="s2">oh I&#39;ve been like you know I&#39;ve broken</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.400" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">my arm okay well not to set back to my</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.130" end="00:31:58.780" style="s2">body but it&#39;s not a setback to my</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:02.530" style="s2">character and I think one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:06.130" style="s2">ways to engage in this kind of process</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.530" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">is to have difficult situations I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.130" end="00:32:10.900" style="s2">this is a concept that has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:12.730" style="s2">about reimagining obstacles as tests and</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.730" end="00:32:17.799" style="s2">hardest thing that I found to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.850" end="00:32:19.660" style="s2">really physically difficult you do it in</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.590" end="00:33:56.060" style="s2">think perhaps something like public</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.610" end="00:33:57.650" style="s2">speaking would be like that as well you</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.060" end="00:34:01.100" style="s2">know something like this which is which</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.650" end="00:34:04.490" style="s2">can be difficult but doesn&#39;t set you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.100" end="00:34:06.950" style="s2">back on in a substantial way is a great</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.490" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">way to to begin and practice that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.950" end="00:34:13.610" style="s2">training that&#39;s the main way that I that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:15.830" style="s2">I practice my stoicism another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.610" end="00:34:18.440" style="s2">just it&#39;s just reflecting strongly ansan</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.830" end="00:34:21.410" style="s2">so I believe another way that I practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.440" end="00:34:24.260" style="s2">those thing that&#39;s really helpful is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.410" end="00:34:25.250" style="s2">terms of working through emotions so one</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.260" end="00:34:26.630" style="s2">thing we didn&#39;t get the chance to talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.250" end="00:34:28.130" style="s2">about is the stoke theory of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.630" end="00:34:30.080" style="s2">which is like really robust and really</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.130" end="00:34:32.420" style="s2">really helpful and it&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.080" end="00:34:34.730" style="s2">our emotions correspond to beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.420" end="00:34:37.730" style="s2">the world and one thing stoicism really</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.730" end="00:34:39.380" style="s2">helped me do was stop doing emotions as</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.730" end="00:34:41.660" style="s2">being antagonistic or things that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.380" end="00:34:43.640" style="s2">fought against and viewing emotions as</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.660" end="00:34:45.320" style="s2">well this emotion is rooted in something</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.640" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">it&#39;s rooted in an evaluation about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.320" end="00:34:49.640" style="s2">way the world is what evaluation is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:52.630" style="s2">do I want to hold on to that evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.640" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">is that something I really believe in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.630" end="00:34:56.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:34:58.500" style="s2">I would say the place where besides</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.730" end="00:35:00.120" style="s2">doing intentionally difficult things the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.500" end="00:35:02.250" style="s2">place where I practice stoicism the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:05.160" style="s2">is in reflecting on my own emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.250" end="00:35:06.170" style="s2">life and being like why am I upset right</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.160" end="00:35:09.090" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.170" end="00:35:10.710" style="s2">what judgment is producing that or even</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.090" end="00:35:13.350" style="s2">why am i happy is that is that a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.710" end="00:35:15.570" style="s2">judgment that I want to have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.350" end="00:35:18.900" style="s2">of process of self reflecting working</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.570" end="00:35:20.550" style="s2">through that is both helpful to be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.900" end="00:35:22.440" style="s2">stoic but also helpful in me like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.550" end="00:35:25.650" style="s2">learning about myself and and being</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.440" end="00:35:27.330" style="s2">happier right right yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.650" end="00:35:29.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s this impression that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.330" end="00:35:32.820" style="s2">stoic sure you know emotionless people</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.010" end="00:35:35.610" style="s2">but I found that as well that to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.820" end="00:35:38.310" style="s2">practice of stoicism it created what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.610" end="00:35:39.990" style="s2">know the like how acceptance commitment</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.310" end="00:35:41.550" style="s2">therapy called a cognitive diffusion I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.990" end="00:35:43.080" style="s2">can kind of like have some distance away</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.550" end="00:35:45.570" style="s2">from my emotions and my thoughts so</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.080" end="00:35:47.070" style="s2">they&#39;re not like conflated and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.570" end="00:35:48.420" style="s2">by having this I have a better</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.070" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">relationship with my emotional states</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.420" end="00:35:53.850" style="s2">now I can kind of leaning into the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:55.020" style="s2">well so I totally agree with that sauce</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.850" end="00:35:58.170" style="s2">one more question then we&#39;ll open up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.020" end="00:36:01.620" style="s2">the room the present moment was covert</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.170" end="00:36:03.330" style="s2">and pandemic how do you how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.620" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">this relates to stoicism and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.330" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">think we can practice our stoicism er</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.620" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">used maybe this this whole crisis as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:13.290" style="s2">opportunity mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:15.540" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s like I think quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.290" end="00:36:18.290" style="s2">stereotypically I mean it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.540" end="00:36:18.290" style="s2">obviously like</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.710" end="00:36:22.730" style="s2">a major issue that&#39;s like out of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.510" end="00:36:24.770" style="s2">control in a lot of ways in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.730" end="00:36:28.369" style="s2">it&#39;s actionable in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.770" end="00:36:29.960" style="s2">self-isolation in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.369" end="00:36:33.410" style="s2">perhaps looking out for your community</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.960" end="00:36:35.930" style="s2">helping people with things they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.410" end="00:36:38.359" style="s2">helped with and then just just isolate</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.930" end="00:36:39.710" style="s2">yourself as much as possible but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.359" end="00:36:40.820" style="s2">a lot of fear and a lot of the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.710" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">on something that was not produced</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.820" end="00:36:46.150" style="s2">because anybody here&#39;s fault and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">not a result of anybody hears mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.150" end="00:36:50.060" style="s2">but nonetheless seems like it has the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:51.500" style="s2">capacity to harm and what we take to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.060" end="00:36:55.390" style="s2">the most harmful way which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.500" end="00:36:57.859" style="s2">death or extreme physical pain or</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.390" end="00:37:00.080" style="s2">financial ruin right so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.859" end="00:37:03.859" style="s2">you have this natural force that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.080" end="00:37:05.420" style="s2">of our control that will be harmful in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.859" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">all the ways people take to be most</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.420" end="00:37:10.250" style="s2">harmful if you don&#39;t just take the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:15.109" style="s2">picture that vices is the only Beth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.250" end="00:37:18.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a huge huge test I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.109" end="00:37:19.940" style="s2">one way stoicism can be helpful is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.230" end="00:37:22.580" style="s2">in it just in a moment-to-moment therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.940" end="00:37:24.830" style="s2">and just in focusing reverting to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.580" end="00:37:27.700" style="s2">dichotomy of control focusing on what</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.830" end="00:37:31.430" style="s2">you can control and what is up to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.700" end="00:37:35.330" style="s2">another way that it can be helpful is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.430" end="00:37:38.839" style="s2">think in evaluating ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.330" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">fundamentally rational animals we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.839" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">very lucky and I don&#39;t want to speak for</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:44.599" style="s2">everybody&#39;s condition because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:46.430" style="s2">know everybody situations but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.599" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">lucky to be in this situation at a time</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.430" end="00:37:50.200" style="s2">where we have the Internet at a time</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:55.010" style="s2">where we have access to information</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.200" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">access to things like this where we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.010" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">hopefully still find ways to pass the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.190" end="00:38:04.430" style="s2">time that is meaningful and enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">that is that is intellectual in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:07.160" style="s2">and and connect with that aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:09.410" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.160" end="00:38:11.390" style="s2">I think perhaps that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.410" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">difficult for the people in this session</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.390" end="00:38:15.020" style="s2">right now these are probably people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">are you are probably more inclined</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.020" end="00:38:19.339" style="s2">towards that but I think it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:21.320" style="s2">opportunity for people to find oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.339" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s ways for me to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.320" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">be happy in circumstances that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">thought I couldn&#39;t be happy and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:30.020" style="s2">another thing that Seneca talks about</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:31.240" style="s2">that most people probably be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.020" end="00:38:33.820" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.240" end="00:38:35.980" style="s2">which is that he recommends to you no</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.820" end="00:38:37.750" style="s2">intentional discomfort so live in</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.980" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">poverty for a couple months and then for</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.750" end="00:38:41.170" style="s2">the rest of your life you think oh is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.080" style="s2">this the worst that can happen to me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.170" end="00:38:45.609" style="s2">this the worst that can happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.080" end="00:38:48.490" style="s2">think situations like this provide</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.609" end="00:38:50.290" style="s2">opportunities to realize the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.490" end="00:38:53.849" style="s2">for people to step up the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.290" end="00:38:57.609" style="s2">people to inspire and work together and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.849" end="00:39:01.560" style="s2">still produce meaningful helpful</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.609" end="00:39:04.350" style="s2">experiences even in the face of pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.560" end="00:39:06.210" style="s2">so then hopefully when that passes that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.350" end="00:39:08.580" style="s2">gives us all a bit more confidence about</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.210" end="00:39:10.620" style="s2">our robustness and about our anti</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.580" end="00:39:13.140" style="s2">fragility than we might have assumed</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.620" end="00:39:17.490" style="s2">their thoughts and I find that inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.140" end="00:39:21.060" style="s2">helpful right right okay so let&#39;s turn</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.490" end="00:39:23.550" style="s2">to the questions dawn you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.060" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">could you go off mute and ask it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.550" end="00:39:29.070" style="s2">Michael yep absolutely thank you Peter</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:31.320" style="s2">I&#39;m behind Michael thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.070" end="00:39:33.180" style="s2">that great overview you had a task and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.320" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">half there in 20 minutes and you just</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.180" end="00:39:39.030" style="s2">about did it it&#39;s a great overview so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:40.920" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly new to stoicism I&#39;m a fresh</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.030" end="00:39:43.500" style="s2">stoic as I like to call myself and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.920" end="00:39:47.460" style="s2">definitely still finding my way and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.500" end="00:39:49.560" style="s2">love the looking at the world and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.460" end="00:39:51.180" style="s2">how we process things as good or bad and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.560" end="00:39:54.630" style="s2">taking that step back and having that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.180" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">distance and but I wonder if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.630" end="00:39:57.900" style="s2">risk and and I wonder if I&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:39:59.690" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.900" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">actually I&#39;ve distanced myself too far</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.690" end="00:40:05.540" style="s2">so that I don&#39;t judge too fast and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:09.710" style="s2">don&#39;t you know I take the pause to think</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.540" end="00:40:13.020" style="s2">about what my next step is can we do the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.710" end="00:40:15.120" style="s2">cognitive diffusion too much like can we</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.020" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">be at risk of putting too much distance</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.120" end="00:40:19.530" style="s2">between ourselves and and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">happening so that we become unfeeling so</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.530" end="00:40:23.580" style="s2">that we become numb rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:29.700" style="s2">processing it in the right way if that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.580" end="00:40:30.870" style="s2">makes sense yeah absolutely um so one</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.700" end="00:40:32.340" style="s2">thing that I think is helpful is like</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.870" end="00:40:34.410" style="s2">looking at these schools in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.340" end="00:40:37.700" style="s2">with one another so stoicism was around</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.410" end="00:40:40.140" style="s2">at the same time as a skepticism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.700" end="00:40:42.060" style="s2">what skepticism would say is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.140" end="00:40:44.340" style="s2">skepticism is Towson&#39;s both agreed look</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.060" end="00:40:46.470" style="s2">suspend all your judgments until you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.340" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">know what&#39;s true and the skeptics would</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.470" end="00:40:50.130" style="s2">say well you can&#39;t know what&#39;s true so</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:53.070" style="s2">you just stay in that suspended state</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.130" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">and the Stoics say well no you can and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.070" end="00:40:58.080" style="s2">then you progress forward they just do</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.610" style="s2">it cautiously and carefully so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.080" end="00:41:01.500" style="s2">we can do especially if we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.610" end="00:41:03.540" style="s2">stoicism as a therapy which I think a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.500" end="00:41:05.130" style="s2">lot of people do is they say look I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.540" end="00:41:06.780" style="s2">been sitting in these judgments I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:08.700" style="s2">recognize that these judgments are</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.780" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">causing me pain and suffering so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.700" end="00:41:12.869" style="s2">going to take a step back from those</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:16.849" style="s2">judgments that makes me feel better</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.869" end="00:41:19.019" style="s2">and there becomes a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.849" end="00:41:22.859" style="s2">reintegrating or there becomes a habit</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.019" end="00:41:25.529" style="s2">of stepping away that just becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.859" end="00:41:28.049" style="s2">practiced that we&#39;re not good at taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.529" end="00:41:30.569" style="s2">the step back in and re incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.049" end="00:41:32.460" style="s2">things into our value system I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.569" end="00:41:34.499" style="s2">it&#39;s totally possible to do the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.460" end="00:41:37.109" style="s2">would advocate to you for you to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.499" end="00:41:41.549" style="s2">it I think one thing that&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.109" end="00:41:43.170" style="s2">avoid it is to recognize that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.549" end="00:41:44.430" style="s2">process so I think what a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.170" end="00:41:45.509" style="s2">want to do that or at least what I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.430" end="00:41:47.369" style="s2">it to do I can speak for myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.509" end="00:41:48.779" style="s2">is you say well if the goal of Stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.369" end="00:41:50.490" style="s2">is to not be upset about what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.779" end="00:41:52.559" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be upset about I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.490" end="00:41:54.749" style="s2">about anything done I have achieved the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.559" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">goal of Stoicism and that&#39;s not the goal</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.749" end="00:41:58.559" style="s2">of stoicism the goal of stoicism is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:00.410" style="s2">feel the right way about things so not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.559" end="00:42:04.289" style="s2">be upset about things that don&#39;t deserve</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.410" end="00:42:06.140" style="s2">your upsetness and to feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.289" end="00:42:09.180" style="s2">things that you should feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.140" end="00:42:11.279" style="s2">and when we think about it like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.180" end="00:42:13.789" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that initial jump to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.279" end="00:42:15.869" style="s2">pull away too much but if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.789" end="00:42:18.660" style="s2">forgive ourselves and we say look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.869" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">Stoics in progress the the Stoics age</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.660" end="00:42:22.619" style="s2">came once every 500 years I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.910" end="00:42:25.589" style="s2">reintegrate things and in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.619" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">allowing myself to care about virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.589" end="00:42:31.380" style="s2">care in the right way about my family</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:32.849" style="s2">and my friends I&#39;m gonna care about when</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.380" end="00:42:34.289" style="s2">my friend made fun of me or I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.849" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">make a mistake and that&#39;s gonna hurt</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.289" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">when it shouldn&#39;t hurt and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:40.380" style="s2">forgive ourselves and allow that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:42.329" style="s2">allowing mistakes in reintegration I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.380" end="00:42:45.059" style="s2">think if you do that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.329" end="00:42:46.349" style="s2">reasonable process that&#39;s really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.059" end="00:42:48.930" style="s2">actually I love that I&#39;ve just written</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.349" end="00:42:50.940" style="s2">that down the key is not to feel things</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.930" end="00:42:52.650" style="s2">but to feel the right way about things</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.940" end="00:42:54.900" style="s2">that absolutely nails it I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.650" end="00:42:56.579" style="s2">actually so say thank you and I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.900" end="00:42:57.869" style="s2">beat myself up quite so much when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.579" end="00:42:59.549" style="s2">like am I feeling the right thing or are</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.869" end="00:43:01.230" style="s2">we not feeling you anything at all so a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.549" end="00:43:02.839" style="s2">super helpful thank you so much I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.230" end="00:43:06.509" style="s2">appreciate that Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.839" end="00:43:09.779" style="s2">cool Greg Lopez you had I think two</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.509" end="00:43:11.369" style="s2">questions yes I do but I&#39;ll just take</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.779" end="00:43:12.239" style="s2">one from now and if there&#39;s time I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.369" end="00:43:14.970" style="s2">for the other one</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.239" end="00:43:16.230" style="s2">thank you Michael I&#39;ve been seeing your</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.970" end="00:43:19.769" style="s2">work for a while and really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.230" end="00:43:22.140" style="s2">your master&#39;s thesis as well so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.769" end="00:43:23.700" style="s2">question is about something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.140" end="00:43:25.559" style="s2">you said at the very beginning where you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.700" end="00:43:26.740" style="s2">kind of as the first step of the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.559" end="00:43:28.869" style="s2">is you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.740" end="00:43:31.960" style="s2">off on your own and suspend judgment</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.869" end="00:43:33.670" style="s2">about your values and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.960" end="00:43:36.070" style="s2">first step and that&#39;s your take on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.670" end="00:43:39.160" style="s2">or epictetus ISM your interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.070" end="00:43:41.230" style="s2">the discipline of action so Epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.160" end="00:43:43.000" style="s2">was primarily teaching students away at</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.230" end="00:43:44.200" style="s2">college I think according to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.000" end="00:43:46.359" style="s2">understanding they were essentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.200" end="00:43:48.670" style="s2">going away young men wealthy men who</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.359" end="00:43:50.859" style="s2">were in training and they had the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.670" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">opportunity to do this it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.859" end="00:43:55.150" style="s2">a monk could the monk code of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:57.310" style="s2">going off to college and so modern</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.150" end="00:43:59.080" style="s2">Stoics when they pick this up don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.310" end="00:44:01.570" style="s2">that luxury we can&#39;t go off the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.080" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">college and go to a dorm and try to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.570" end="00:44:05.380" style="s2">stoic and learn the theory first and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:07.180" style="s2">then walk around and suspend our</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.380" end="00:44:09.670" style="s2">judgments about values so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.180" end="00:44:12.369" style="s2">suggest modern Stoics go about living</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.670" end="00:44:14.849" style="s2">their lives as family members and having</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.369" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">the jobs they have and stuff while still</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.849" end="00:44:20.440" style="s2">holding their desires lately yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:22.260" style="s2">this is great so thanks so much for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.440" end="00:44:24.460" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.260" end="00:44:26.109" style="s2">yeah there was so much to cover I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.460" end="00:44:29.980" style="s2">could pull into it so specifically what</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.109" end="00:44:32.020" style="s2">he says is not to suspend desire and</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.020" end="00:44:37.240" style="s2">not an aversion and limit yourself only</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.180" end="00:44:39.099" style="s2">to impulse to act an impulse not to act</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.240" end="00:44:42.580" style="s2">and these are technical terms but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.099" end="00:44:43.420" style="s2">impulse is a gentler feeling and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.580" end="00:44:46.900" style="s2">I&#39;m Gregory I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.420" end="00:44:48.070" style="s2">with this but it&#39;s it&#39;s something so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.900" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">example I would like to think of impulse</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.070" end="00:44:52.630" style="s2">I think of it like oh I really want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.839" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">go get ice cream but if I don&#39;t get ice</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.630" end="00:44:57.880" style="s2">cream I&#39;m not gonna let that ruin my day</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:45:01.540" style="s2">so there was an impulse I planned my day</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.880" end="00:45:03.490" style="s2">I walked to the store I motivated myself</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.540" end="00:45:05.380" style="s2">I recognized that that good would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.490" end="00:45:07.450" style="s2">coming but it&#39;s a very gentle kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.380" end="00:45:11.230" style="s2">good and when I don&#39;t get the ice cream</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.450" end="00:45:14.710" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay that is not preferable but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.230" end="00:45:18.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not crying I&#39;m not angry I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.710" end="00:45:19.510" style="s2">like mad oh why didn&#39;t I I&#39;m not mad at</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.040" end="00:45:21.609" style="s2">myself why don&#39;t I look up if the ice</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.510" end="00:45:23.320" style="s2">cream place was open or not so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.609" end="00:45:26.410" style="s2">epictetus is position is that these</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.320" end="00:45:27.700" style="s2">these passions from my interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.410" end="00:45:30.580" style="s2">evocation that these passions are</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.700" end="00:45:32.349" style="s2">produced by desire and aversion so he</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.580" end="00:45:34.660" style="s2">says this outright passions are produced</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.349" end="00:45:37.390" style="s2">alone by desire and aversion impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.660" end="00:45:40.150" style="s2">act and not act which are when we we</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.390" end="00:45:42.039" style="s2">judge something to be prefer</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.150" end="00:45:44.260" style="s2">or dis preferred so preferable or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.039" end="00:45:47.589" style="s2">preferable those don&#39;t produce passions</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.260" end="00:45:49.480" style="s2">so those are able to motivate but they</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.589" end="00:45:51.490" style="s2">don&#39;t leave us in a passionate State so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.480" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">the ideas at the start it&#39;s not become</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.490" end="00:45:56.500" style="s2">apathetic well is literally its</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:59.349" style="s2">apathetic become not passionate but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.500" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">not don&#39;t be motivated the picture is at</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.349" end="00:46:07.000" style="s2">the starts motivate yourself gently okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:08.589" style="s2">so I&#39;m still going to do this job</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.000" end="00:46:11.799" style="s2">interview I&#39;m still going to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.589" end="00:46:13.900" style="s2">I&#39;m still going to on you know attempt</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.799" end="00:46:15.640" style="s2">to impress that person I want to like me</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.900" end="00:46:17.289" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna see I&#39;m gonna view it as</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.640" end="00:46:20.200" style="s2">this would be preferable if this happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.289" end="00:46:23.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t let that strong feeling of I</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.200" end="00:46:24.609" style="s2">really want this to come and then what</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.410" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna say is eventually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.609" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">gonna unlock that strong feeling but</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:33.400" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna point to virtue or</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:34.690" style="s2">vice excellent thank you thank you Greg</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.400" end="00:46:37.299" style="s2">you want to sneak your other question in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.690" end="00:46:39.819" style="s2">there um if you&#39;d like it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.299" end="00:46:40.839" style="s2">cutting anybody else off um so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.819" end="00:46:41.349" style="s2">second question is a little more</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.839" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.349" end="00:46:45.010" style="s2">it&#39;s about logic I know so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:47.619" style="s2">following peer had those model of logic</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.010" end="00:46:50.559" style="s2">being uh associated with the third topic</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.619" end="00:46:53.049" style="s2">but my understanding of the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.559" end="00:46:54.849" style="s2">stoic training is that you actually sit</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.049" end="00:46:57.039" style="s2">down in a classroom learn some basic</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.849" end="00:46:59.829" style="s2">logic and in order to suss out what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.039" end="00:47:01.809" style="s2">stoic ideas of good and bad actually are</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.829" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">because you can derive that virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.809" end="00:47:04.660" style="s2">the only good it&#39;s not an axiom and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.010" style="s2">do that by looking at these</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.660" end="00:47:08.440" style="s2">psychological components called</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.010" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">preconceptions prolepsis and you just</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.440" end="00:47:11.890" style="s2">try to tease apart how your sussing good</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">and bad and getting a clearer idea of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.890" end="00:47:15.220" style="s2">then you go and start your training so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:17.230" style="s2">I&#39;m curious if you can say when did</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.220" end="00:47:18.670" style="s2">logic come into play in epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.230" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">training program was it really just</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.670" end="00:47:22.029" style="s2">toward the end or was there a touch at</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">the beginning and then it was focused on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.029" end="00:47:28.359" style="s2">at the end yeah great um I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:31.000" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a fair assessment so when</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.359" end="00:47:33.490" style="s2">I was talking about progressing this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.000" end="00:47:35.260" style="s2">a progression of mastery so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.490" end="00:47:37.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t you you you study them</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.260" end="00:47:38.740" style="s2">sequentially so you don&#39;t study them</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.720" end="00:47:41.559" style="s2">sequentially you master them</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.740" end="00:47:44.289" style="s2">sequentially the first one is the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.559" end="00:47:46.359" style="s2">important because if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.289" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">passionate state you&#39;re you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.359" end="00:47:49.990" style="s2">to be receptive you know you take</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:52.930" style="s2">someone who&#39;s in a passionate state you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.990" end="00:47:53.329" style="s2">sit them down and you derive why virtue</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.930" end="00:47:55.309" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.329" end="00:47:57.259" style="s2">good you&#39;re gonna be like like shut up</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.309" end="00:48:01.509" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna care i they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.259" end="00:48:04.069" style="s2">gonna be receptive to reason so we I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.509" end="00:48:05.390" style="s2">think the first thing is that to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.069" end="00:48:08.839" style="s2">people out of that passion of state as</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.390" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">soon as possible but then obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.839" end="00:48:13.700" style="s2">need some capacity to reason you need</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:16.219" style="s2">some capacity to follow arguments to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.700" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">study it is just that this cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.219" end="00:48:19.670" style="s2">mastered until the end because a can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:22.130" style="s2">be mastered until you&#39;ve gone away with</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.670" end="00:48:23.479" style="s2">passions and be well you&#39;re mastering is</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.130" end="00:48:25.099" style="s2">you&#39;re mastering your knowledge your</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.479" end="00:48:27.289" style="s2">solidifying your knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.099" end="00:48:30.019" style="s2">transition towards virtue right and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.289" end="00:48:31.579" style="s2">can&#39;t solidify what isn&#39;t there so you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.019" end="00:48:33.349" style="s2">have to be you have to be fleshed out</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.579" end="00:48:35.269" style="s2">and in a good position in the first two</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.349" end="00:48:38.690" style="s2">areas of study before you can solidify</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.269" end="00:48:40.549" style="s2">um but we take it step back the third</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.690" end="00:48:41.959" style="s2">area of study Epictetus says if the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.549" end="00:48:43.999" style="s2">first one corresponds to desire and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.959" end="00:48:46.549" style="s2">aversion and the second one corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.999" end="00:48:48.410" style="s2">to impulses the third one corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.549" end="00:48:51.259" style="s2">a sense so the third area study</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.410" end="00:48:54.259" style="s2">epictetus says is about a scent so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.259" end="00:48:56.299" style="s2">just about making sure that we give our</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.259" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">scent our belief we believed we judged</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.299" end="00:49:01.670" style="s2">to be true the correct things in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:05.059" style="s2">correct way and obviously you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.670" end="00:49:06.859" style="s2">to be doing that at any step you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.059" end="00:49:07.940" style="s2">not gonna be able to master it until</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.859" end="00:49:10.999" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your emotions and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.940" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">passions under control and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.999" end="00:49:17.900" style="s2">the picture cool thank you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:20.809" style="s2">cool and we&#39;ll end off with a question</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.900" end="00:49:24.459" style="s2">from Ben and he had two questions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.809" end="00:49:24.459" style="s2">you can choose one and ask it to Michael</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.259" end="00:49:29.709" style="s2">it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">let me see if a deist on the chat yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.730" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">okay he&#39;s not a mute Ben can you hear us</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:51.450" style="s2">okay I might have difficulty I&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:55.950" style="s2">this question this mics not working kid</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.450" end="00:49:57.960" style="s2">let me ask this first one okay so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.950" end="00:49:59.730" style="s2">is from Ben how would you how would one</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.960" end="00:50:01.980" style="s2">assess and evaluate progress in moral</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.730" end="00:50:04.380" style="s2">education how do we determine whether or</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.980" end="00:50:07.190" style="s2">not our training a stoicism or any other</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.380" end="00:50:13.470" style="s2">intentional way of living is effective</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.190" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">yeah great um so in facism you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.470" end="00:50:19.890" style="s2">progressing towards knowledge knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:21.270" style="s2">of the way the world is and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.890" end="00:50:23.370" style="s2">much aspects of still excite all day I</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.270" end="00:50:24.990" style="s2">love and I would love to dig into but</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.370" end="00:50:26.310" style="s2">their intellectual ists which means that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.990" end="00:50:28.230" style="s2">our motivation is derived from our</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.310" end="00:50:30.300" style="s2">judgments and our emotions are derived</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.230" end="00:50:33.060" style="s2">from our judgments so I pursue things</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.300" end="00:50:37.020" style="s2">because I view them a certain way and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.060" end="00:50:38.670" style="s2">feel anger sadness joy because I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.020" end="00:50:42.810" style="s2">certain things have happened to me but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.670" end="00:50:45.690" style="s2">evaluate to be good or bad so progress</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.810" end="00:50:48.200" style="s2">would be thinking the right things about</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.690" end="00:50:50.670" style="s2">things right we&#39;re gaining knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.200" end="00:50:51.990" style="s2">successfully categorizing more and more</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.670" end="00:50:54.120" style="s2">things in the correct way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.990" end="00:50:56.670" style="s2">successfully thinking about more and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.120" end="00:50:58.980" style="s2">more things in the correct way this</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.670" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">would be progress and now in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.980" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">how you evaluate it I would say in</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.450" style="s2">stoicism you can it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:10.340" style="s2">personal philosophy you can evaluate it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.450" end="00:51:14.310" style="s2">by your physical state so instead ISM</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.340" end="00:51:16.620" style="s2">lucky for us according to the Stoics God</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.310" end="00:51:18.410" style="s2">has put us in a position where we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.620" end="00:51:20.790" style="s2">achieve all things that are good and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.410" end="00:51:22.140" style="s2">avoid all things that are bad right</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.790" end="00:51:25.190" style="s2">because what&#39;s good and bad is virtue in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.140" end="00:51:27.780" style="s2">Vikes so if you feel yourself being</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.190" end="00:51:29.730" style="s2">frustrated or being feeling really</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.780" end="00:51:32.850" style="s2">strong emotions about the about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.730" end="00:51:35.550" style="s2">world this is because you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.850" end="00:51:37.590" style="s2">Stoics perception you&#39;re putting value</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.550" end="00:51:40.580" style="s2">judgments that are incorrect onto the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.590" end="00:51:43.500" style="s2">world so I think the way you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.580" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">evaluate progress and stoicism is your</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.500" end="00:51:47.980" style="s2">equity</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">your feeling of tranquility your feeling</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.980" end="00:51:53.560" style="s2">your capacity to deal with hardships and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:55.840" style="s2">maintain a smooth motion through them um</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.560" end="00:51:57.190" style="s2">but that&#39;s that can be quite significant</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.840" end="00:51:58.780" style="s2">so then other things you pick up is just</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.190" end="00:52:02.320" style="s2">psychological skills so you can evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:04.119" style="s2">your progress by being well I made a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.320" end="00:52:05.650" style="s2">mistake there but I noticed I made a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.119" end="00:52:09.310" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.650" end="00:52:11.560" style="s2">you know I eisah came to that temptation</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.310" end="00:52:14.380" style="s2">but I held out a little bit longer than</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.560" end="00:52:15.880" style="s2">I did before and just becoming I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.380" end="00:52:17.910" style="s2">one of the best ways to starting</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.880" end="00:52:20.619" style="s2">stoicism is just this mindfulness or</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.910" end="00:52:23.050" style="s2">more awareness of kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.619" end="00:52:24.280" style="s2">processes and how they function people</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.050" end="00:52:28.900" style="s2">talk a lot about journaling in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.280" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">respect as a helpful tool to that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.900" end="00:52:36.580" style="s2">terms of in terms of other systems I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:38.340" style="s2">would say what any ethical system should</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.580" end="00:52:40.540" style="s2">have you should have a consistency</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.340" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">between when we look at it as moral</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.540" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">education and not just theoretical I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:46.859" style="s2">think a good way to evaluate it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:51.160" style="s2">consistency between beliefs and actions</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.859" end="00:52:52.900" style="s2">right so for the Stoics there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.160" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">always consistency between beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.900" end="00:52:56.140" style="s2">actions if you believe something you</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:57.220" style="s2">will do it so if you have a problem in</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.140" end="00:52:59.080" style="s2">your actions you have a problem your</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.220" end="00:53:01.600" style="s2">beliefs and you need to re-evaluate and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.080" end="00:53:04.150" style="s2">be honest with yourself but for other</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.600" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">schools of thought like Aristotle or</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.150" end="00:53:07.240" style="s2">something like this there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:09.940" style="s2">animalistic side there&#39;s a habituation</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.240" end="00:53:14.890" style="s2">aspect so I think a good way to gauge</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.940" end="00:53:17.650" style="s2">progress is to just gauge well if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.890" end="00:53:20.680" style="s2">think X is good you know if I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.650" end="00:53:23.910" style="s2">good to work out and reach out to my</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.680" end="00:53:27.070" style="s2">family and be kind in people I see and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.910" end="00:53:28.660" style="s2">journal twice a day am i doing these</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.070" end="00:53:31.390" style="s2">kind of things so is there a connection</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.660" end="00:53:33.160" style="s2">between what I set out in my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.390" end="00:53:35.020" style="s2">good plans and the way that I act</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.160" end="00:53:36.930" style="s2">because regardless of what your value</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.020" end="00:53:39.460" style="s2">system is if that connection is broken</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.930" end="00:53:42.220" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re never going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.460" end="00:53:45.820" style="s2">manifest that value system so for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.220" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">that is that is a really good way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.820" end="00:53:51.270" style="s2">gauging progress I would rather have</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:54.550" style="s2">someone who is ignorant but consistent</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.270" end="00:53:55.840" style="s2">then someone who seems knowledgeable but</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.550" end="00:53:58.060" style="s2">is inconsistent because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.840" end="00:53:59.500" style="s2">inconsistency it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.060" end="00:54:01.360" style="s2">perhaps more complicated where the issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.500" end="00:54:03.250" style="s2">is if someone is consistent you just</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.360" end="00:54:05.710" style="s2">need to educate them or change their</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.250" end="00:54:07.510" style="s2">opinion so I think that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.710" end="00:54:09.190" style="s2">evaluate your own progress regardless</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.510" end="00:54:11.170" style="s2">what you believe am I consistent do I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.190" end="00:54:12.809" style="s2">what I think is good do I avoid what I</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.170" end="00:54:16.420" style="s2">think is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.809" end="00:54:19.809" style="s2">mmm-hmm very cool so well-well</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.420" end="00:54:21.490" style="s2">understeer Michael before we go to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.809" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">closing thoughts do you have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.490" end="00:54:26.410" style="s2">closing words yourself on anything that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.430" end="00:54:28.990" style="s2">was said today yeah that was my first</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.410" end="00:54:32.710" style="s2">time like trying to flush that out in</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.990" end="00:54:34.270" style="s2">time please I mean please anybody if</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.710" end="00:54:35.980" style="s2">you&#39;re more interested in it continue to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.270" end="00:54:38.049" style="s2">like reach out to me I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.980" end="00:54:40.030" style="s2">talk about it casually I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.049" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">interested in this stuff but the picture</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.030" end="00:54:45.069" style="s2">that I wanted to give was just that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:46.660" style="s2">there there there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.069" end="00:54:50.349" style="s2">an overall project that you&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.660" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">in and and if you if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.349" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">transform yourself educate yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.980" style="s2">that project and take part in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">project not just in certain concepts</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.980" end="00:55:00.520" style="s2">like they cut the economy of control can</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:03.099" style="s2">be helpful but there there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.520" end="00:55:05.829" style="s2">stoicism to flesh out and then another</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.099" end="00:55:06.970" style="s2">thing I guess is this is seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.829" end="00:55:09.010" style="s2">difference and highlighting this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.970" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">difference between you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.010" end="00:55:12.369" style="s2">take to be good and how you act and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:15.130" style="s2">looking at a project of moral education</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.369" end="00:55:16.599" style="s2">as I guess that pursuit of consistency</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.130" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">that pursuit of acting in accordance</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.599" end="00:55:20.980" style="s2">with what you take to be good and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">guess I just want to leave off with it</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.980" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">with how important I think that project</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:27.609" style="s2">is and recognizing that project as being</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:29.230" style="s2">separate in some ways from just the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.609" end="00:55:32.349" style="s2">study of ethics with just the study of</p>
