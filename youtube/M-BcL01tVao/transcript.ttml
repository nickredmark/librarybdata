<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">before hop in I&#39;m gonna mention the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:41.479" style="s2">while covers an unbelievable amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">ground from history to philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.479" end="00:01:46.430" style="s2">many details of many different fields of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">psychology it is actually surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.430" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">readable so don&#39;t be afraid of it if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">really want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">Greg&#39;s work get the book I actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">enjoyed reading it so I give a thumbs up</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.450" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">well thank you so much that&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:03.720" style="s2">hear yeah you obviously put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">work into it I was it was like wow this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.720" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">thing covers tremendous amount of ground</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:10.020" style="s2">and yet it coheres which the two are</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">hard to do at the same time to say the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">amen so let&#39;s jump into it let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">with kind of an obvious question what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.200" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question Jim and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:25.769" style="s2">certainly one of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">launched me on this entire journey you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.769" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">know I took 60 credits of psychology as</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:32.069" style="s2">an undergrad actually went to James</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:35.459" style="s2">Madison as an undergrad but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.069" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">really realize that people didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.459" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">know what psychology was until I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:43.110" style="s2">into graduate school what do I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:44.819" style="s2">that well you&#39;re told as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.110" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">undergraduate that psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.819" end="00:02:50.459" style="s2">science of behavior and mental processes</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:52.200" style="s2">and then what you&#39;re told is hey the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.459" end="00:02:54.360" style="s2">real key thing is that were a science</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.200" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">and we asked scientific questions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.360" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">employ the scientific method but then if</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:01.019" style="s2">you go back in your look and say well</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:03.090" style="s2">what do we actually mean by behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.019" end="00:03:04.769" style="s2">mental processes like what does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.090" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">actually refer to in the world and do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.769" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">have a shared language for that well</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">then you realize that actually no we</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">don&#39;t and we actually really never have</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">the field has never been able to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:19.079" style="s2">define what its subject matter is okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:21.299" style="s2">and I think that seemed to be your</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.079" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">starting point so where do you get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.299" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">what is your definition of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:30.180" style="s2">right so basically it&#39;s a results in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">bit of a switch in the simple way my</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.180" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">definition of basic psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear me make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:37.230" style="s2">between what I call basic psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">which is the science of mental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.230" end="00:03:41.459" style="s2">what do I mean by mental behavior mental</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">behavior refers to the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.459" end="00:03:47.819" style="s2">animals as whole as a whole mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">a neuro cognitive system okay so anytime</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.819" end="00:03:52.019" style="s2">you would see an animal engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">particular kind of activity that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.019" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">coordinated by the brain that involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">sort of a dynamic complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.420" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">feedback loop that is what I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">consider to be mental behavior and get</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">into it and there&#39;s a thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:08.580" style="s2">developed called the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">system which specifies or argues that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.580" end="00:04:13.150" style="s2">should think about nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:14.830" style="s2">the cosmic evolution the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.150" end="00:04:17.350" style="s2">universe at large from our human</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.830" end="00:04:20.139" style="s2">perspective as existing in these planes</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.350" end="00:04:22.870" style="s2">of existence or dimensions of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.139" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">their label matter that&#39;s the base that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.870" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">comes out of the Big Bang and is our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">familiar dimensions of space and time</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:32.680" style="s2">and energy and matter intermingling on</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">the physical dimension and then nested</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:36.510" style="s2">inside of that is the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">complex adaptive dimension called life</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:42.100" style="s2">which refers to cellular behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:45.460" style="s2">regulated by genetic and epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.100" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">processes then what we get certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.460" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">following say the Cambrian explosion</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">which is the currents and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">where we see really the animal kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:55.900" style="s2">come into being that&#39;s when we get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.789" style="s2">emergence of what I call mental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.900" end="00:04:59.949" style="s2">and like I said it&#39;s really it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.789" end="00:05:02.949" style="s2">behavior of complex animal bodies being</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.949" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">regulated mediated by neuro cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.949" end="00:05:07.990" style="s2">processes and then that&#39;s a dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:10.510" style="s2">complexity and then ultimately the key</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.990" end="00:05:12.250" style="s2">to realize is that&#39;s above life or we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.510" end="00:05:14.530" style="s2">can talk about what I mean by above and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">then what also happens later down the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.530" end="00:05:17.560" style="s2">road about a hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:20.200" style="s2">we see the emergence of another</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.560" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">dimension of complexity what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.200" end="00:05:24.669" style="s2">person culture plane of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">that involves the evolution of language</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.669" end="00:05:28.539" style="s2">and what I call processes of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">justification and that gives rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.539" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">whole nother complex adaptive plane and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">the real important thing to realize then</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:38.020" style="s2">is is that the mental corresponds to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:40.419" style="s2">animal yet there&#39;s a whole nother</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.020" end="00:05:42.910" style="s2">dimension and so what that means is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.419" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">that psychology with its definitional</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.910" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">system has really spanned the animal</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.660" style="s2">dimension and the person culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.020" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">dimension and has not clarified at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.660" end="00:05:53.200" style="s2">the distinction between those and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:55.479" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it&#39;s really confusing</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.200" end="00:05:57.849" style="s2">language systems so we need a basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.479" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">psychology that corresponds to the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.849" end="00:06:01.000" style="s2">of the animal in fact we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">that and what&#39;s called comparative</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.000" end="00:06:04.780" style="s2">psychology that should be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.760" style="s2">foundational base of the discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.780" end="00:06:09.849" style="s2">then there should be a unique sub</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.760" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">discipline called human psychology which</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">behavior to human persons but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.260" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">behave so differently than other animals</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">we need additional explanatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:22.780" style="s2">things like sociology anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:24.070" style="s2">really understanding how language and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.780" end="00:06:26.290" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:28.480" style="s2">changes our behavior so radically from</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.290" end="00:06:30.580" style="s2">other animals great that&#39;s a good start</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.480" end="00:06:32.590" style="s2">we will get into the Tree of Life in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.580" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">some detail I expect along with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.590" end="00:06:36.520" style="s2">other parts of your unified theory I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.600" end="00:06:37.930" style="s2">think that gives the people a flavor of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:40.090" style="s2">where you&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.930" end="00:06:42.130" style="s2">another thing you talk about which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.090" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">that you compare and contrast scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.130" end="00:06:46.470" style="s2">psychology as it exists with folk</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:49.330" style="s2">psychology and you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.470" end="00:06:51.100" style="s2">denigrate the folk psychology can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.330" end="00:06:53.560" style="s2">say a little bit more about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.100" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a great point some actually many</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.560" end="00:06:57.160" style="s2">sort of scientific psychological</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:06:59.560" style="s2">approaches whether certainly Freud</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.160" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">Skinner a number of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.560" end="00:07:05.890" style="s2">eliminative material approach is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">just respect folk psychology or really</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.890" end="00:07:10.450" style="s2">dismiss it as having any causal</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.010" style="s2">relevance I actually think that&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.450" end="00:07:13.960" style="s2">wrong and argue that actually we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.010" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get along with our in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.960" end="00:07:17.770" style="s2">with our children there are families if</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:19.660" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t the case that&#39;s something not</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.770" end="00:07:21.790" style="s2">just at the phenomenal but real was</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.660" end="00:07:24.010" style="s2">happening in our conversations and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.790" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">our dialogue now common folk psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.010" end="00:07:28.300" style="s2">is surrounded is really framed by what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.590" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">called belief desire it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.300" end="00:07:31.450" style="s2">language and understanding it means that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:33.130" style="s2">there are people we presume other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.450" end="00:07:36.040" style="s2">have beliefs and we presume they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.130" end="00:07:38.050" style="s2">desires and we operate in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.040" end="00:07:39.850" style="s2">to those essentially what the unified</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.050" end="00:07:42.640" style="s2">theory does is it says it translates</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.850" end="00:07:45.910" style="s2">those concepts into more scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.640" end="00:07:47.710" style="s2">concepts like we are investors in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.910" end="00:07:50.440" style="s2">argue that the essence of what an animal</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.710" end="00:07:52.810" style="s2">is as a behavioral investor that seeks</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.440" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">particular affordances tries to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.810" end="00:07:56.860" style="s2">stressors indeed the brilliant work of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:59.500" style="s2">complex theorists and complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.860" end="00:08:01.570" style="s2">systems provides us excellent scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.500" end="00:08:04.480" style="s2">models for how things will approach and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.570" end="00:08:07.300" style="s2">avoid certain states and I see animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.480" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">then as as investors that then in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.300" end="00:08:11.620" style="s2">ways that would correspond to desires</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:13.660" style="s2">motives things to approach and they also</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.620" end="00:08:15.220" style="s2">try to influence other individuals I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.660" end="00:08:17.860" style="s2">have a model called the influence matrix</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.220" end="00:08:19.620" style="s2">which relates to how we relate to others</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.860" end="00:08:22.360" style="s2">and then ultimately there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.620" end="00:08:23.230" style="s2">self-awareness self-justifying recursive</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.360" end="00:08:25.690" style="s2">part of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.230" end="00:08:27.880" style="s2">that&#39;s called justification that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.690" end="00:08:30.340" style="s2">corresponds the dimension of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.880" end="00:08:32.310" style="s2">propositional beliefs and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.340" end="00:08:34.570" style="s2">translate propositional beliefs into</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.310" end="00:08:37.089" style="s2">justifications and you translate desires</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">into our basic motives</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.089" end="00:08:41.079" style="s2">our relational motives in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">influence that you get a translation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.079" end="00:08:45.959" style="s2">belief desire psychology into</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:48.129" style="s2">justification investment in influence</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.959" end="00:08:49.980" style="s2">psychology and the correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.129" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">actually is quite close in many regards</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.980" end="00:08:53.889" style="s2">that&#39;s actually interesting right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:56.079" style="s2">obviously while we know there are some</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.889" end="00:08:59.529" style="s2">errors in our folk psychology some</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.079" end="00:09:01.480" style="s2">famous logical operational fallacies but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.529" end="00:09:02.589" style="s2">our folk psychology can&#39;t be that bad if</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.480" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten through two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.589" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">thousand years where they&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.870" style="s2">some people have made that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:12.839" style="s2">an epiphenomenon as though as though</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.870" end="00:09:14.889" style="s2">somehow our brains are communicating</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.839" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">independent of what we say and what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.889" end="00:09:19.870" style="s2">you know that seems to me to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">silly actually so I absolutely there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.870" end="00:09:24.220" style="s2">real dynamic going on a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:25.779" style="s2">constructed and so how constructed</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.220" end="00:09:27.399" style="s2">dynamics actually influenced this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.779" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">great question it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.399" end="00:09:30.910" style="s2">that the unified theory attempts to deal</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:32.259" style="s2">with actually our next question will</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.910" end="00:09:34.449" style="s2">actually get into the unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.259" end="00:09:36.970" style="s2">before we do that let&#39;s frame a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.449" end="00:09:39.610" style="s2">bit about where psychology sits in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.970" end="00:09:42.759" style="s2">academic disciplines you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.610" end="00:09:45.009" style="s2">fact that psychology has historically</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.759" end="00:09:47.470" style="s2">and even today kind of had up almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.009" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">gets a frederic two points of view one</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.470" end="00:09:52.089" style="s2">people who think it&#39;s no different than</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">biology or physics two people who think</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.089" end="00:09:56.439" style="s2">it&#39;s almost entirely socially</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">constructed with very little content of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.439" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2">its own where do you come out on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.649" style="s2">and where do you place psychology with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:04.120" style="s2">respect to other academic disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.649" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">that are they&#39;re relatively close</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.120" end="00:10:09.370" style="s2">neighbors ya know that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.980" end="00:10:11.230" style="s2">question and certainly there is a view I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.370" end="00:10:13.329" style="s2">think an appropriate view that when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.230" end="00:10:15.129" style="s2">look at the span of what psychology is I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.329" end="00:10:17.439" style="s2">think you call this schizophrenic it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.129" end="00:10:21.100" style="s2">smeared I sometimes say it&#39;s smeared</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.439" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">across the Academy there was a 24</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.100" end="00:10:25.269" style="s2">chapter three volume book all sat</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">psychology and it&#39;s allied disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.269" end="00:10:29.199" style="s2">it linked psychology into 23 different</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:31.329" style="s2">disciplines starting with physics</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.199" end="00:10:33.459" style="s2">getting all the way up to literature so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.329" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">psychologies relations in the academy is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.459" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">very it&#39;s sort of central and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:43.269" style="s2">diffuse and confusing so I&#39;ll offer that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.550" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">for me what I wanted to understand was</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.269" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">you know it seemed like the Natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.100" end="00:10:49.260" style="s2">Science did pretty well certainly they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:51.750" style="s2">did brilliantly with physics and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.260" end="00:10:54.030" style="s2">chemistry is very well aligned and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.750" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">biology gets placed on top of chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.030" end="00:10:58.200" style="s2">in a particular way that has coherence</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:00.750" style="s2">what was really fascinating to me is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.200" end="00:11:02.790" style="s2">then that coherence breaks down so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.750" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">get the problem of psychology I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.790" end="00:11:07.380" style="s2">always seen psychology as sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:09.570" style="s2">next in line following say biology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.380" end="00:11:11.640" style="s2">then into neuroscience and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.570" end="00:11:13.890" style="s2">version of Natural Science psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.640" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">which corresponds to that animal mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.890" end="00:11:19.350" style="s2">behavioral aspects however it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">case then that psychology moves up into</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.350" end="00:11:24.450" style="s2">the human social sciences it serves us</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:26.520" style="s2">in my model serves as the base of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.450" end="00:11:28.920" style="s2">human social sciences so human</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.520" end="00:11:30.930" style="s2">psychology would then be placed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.920" end="00:11:33.480" style="s2">relationship to the other classic social</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:35.370" style="s2">sciences like for example sociology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.480" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">anthropology on the one hand and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.370" end="00:11:38.220" style="s2">political science doing its thing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:40.020" style="s2">Europe of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.220" end="00:11:42.750" style="s2">economics it&#39;s the science of markets</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.020" end="00:11:45.660" style="s2">and monetary flow but those would then</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.750" end="00:11:48.810" style="s2">represent the macro level sociological</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.660" end="00:11:50.580" style="s2">and cultural processes with psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.810" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">human psychology really being the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.580" end="00:11:54.900" style="s2">science of the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.640" style="s2">small-group creating that bridge the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.900" end="00:11:58.470" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s confusing about very</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.640" end="00:12:00.510" style="s2">interesting about psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.470" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">relationship to the sciences is that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.510" end="00:12:04.740" style="s2">also has a very very powerful at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:07.260" style="s2">in terms of its institutional influence</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.820" end="00:12:18.870" style="s2">might guess the problem of actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:21.090" style="s2">entering people&#39;s spaces meaning their</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.870" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">psychological spaces and dealing with</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.470" end="00:12:36.060" style="s2">and human behavior so we have this issue</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.750" end="00:12:37.770" style="s2">of this whole other set which really</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.060" end="00:12:40.410" style="s2">deals with the issues of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.770" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">issues of human value really fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.410" end="00:12:45.480" style="s2">humanist and concerns that really blend</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:47.070" style="s2">right up into the humanities and if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.480" end="00:12:48.840" style="s2">really like often say if you really want</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.070" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">to understand people I probably go to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.840" end="00:12:54.750" style="s2">Shakespeare first so there is this</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.750" end="00:12:57.960" style="s2">the field that&#39;s funny you should</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.310" end="00:13:01.080" style="s2">mention Shakespeare this morning my wife</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.960" end="00:13:02.499" style="s2">and I were discussing our kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.769" end="00:13:13.229" style="s2">Sopranos are very Shakespearean right</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.439" end="00:13:18.309" style="s2">humans get themselves into jams and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.029" end="00:13:19.809" style="s2">act very badly to get themselves back</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.309" end="00:13:21.729" style="s2">out of them right particularly the</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.019" end="00:13:27.159" style="s2">human nature by reading Shakespeare and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.909" end="00:13:29.529" style="s2">as we both know since we both live not</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.849" end="00:13:33.939" style="s2">great Shakespeare Theatre is right there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.499" end="00:13:35.409" style="s2">at the American Shakespeare Center I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.939" end="00:13:37.179" style="s2">don&#39;t know how if you take an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.409" end="00:13:39.159" style="s2">of that but if you haven&#39;t I highly</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.179" end="00:13:41.409" style="s2">recommend it I have indeed I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.059" end="00:13:47.889" style="s2">experience all right let&#39;s hop back in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.699" end="00:13:49.779" style="s2">the distinction you made I will simplify</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.889" end="00:13:52.029" style="s2">it a little bit between the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.779" end="00:13:54.759" style="s2">and the clinical aspects of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.029" end="00:13:57.849" style="s2">and we know when I go and visit</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.759" end="00:13:59.889" style="s2">psychology departments I often see that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.849" end="00:14:02.379" style="s2">distinction sometimes it&#39;s real clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.889" end="00:14:04.509" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s less clear is your</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.379" end="00:14:06.669" style="s2">unified theory gonna try to address both</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.509" end="00:14:08.859" style="s2">sides or just the scientific side of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.669" end="00:14:11.379" style="s2">that fork no actually it does it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.859" end="00:14:14.589" style="s2">directly related to both sides of it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.379" end="00:14:16.839" style="s2">fact the original impetus so I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.589" end="00:14:18.669" style="s2">trained as a clinician I&#39;m learning a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.839" end="00:14:20.799" style="s2">number of different approaches which I</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.669" end="00:14:24.249" style="s2">think when they&#39;re done very well all</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.799" end="00:14:25.749" style="s2">have value so the updated Freudian</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.249" end="00:14:28.209" style="s2">approach the modern ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.749" end="00:14:29.919" style="s2">sophistical aground in relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.209" end="00:14:32.019" style="s2">underlying motivation and how humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.919" end="00:14:35.109" style="s2">rationalize those provide very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.019" end="00:14:36.669" style="s2">powerful models I was always learned and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.109" end="00:14:39.369" style="s2">oriented towards more of a social</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.669" end="00:14:42.279" style="s2">cognitive view so if I learned back</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.369" end="00:14:43.479" style="s2">approach or Albert Ellis these are major</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.279" end="00:14:46.389" style="s2">figures who want to call cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.479" end="00:14:48.369" style="s2">therapy I&#39;ve had an appreciation for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.389" end="00:14:50.799" style="s2">behavioral approach and its scientific</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.369" end="00:14:52.659" style="s2">analysis of learning I have an</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.799" end="00:14:54.069" style="s2">appreciation for the humanistic approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.659" end="00:14:55.749" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.069" end="00:14:57.329" style="s2">about real people encountering each</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.749" end="00:14:59.919" style="s2">other and try to create an authentic</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.329" end="00:15:00.519" style="s2">relationship that actually is conducive</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.919" end="00:15:02.559" style="s2">to healing</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.519" end="00:15:04.989" style="s2">I&#39;ve got appreciation for family systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.559" end="00:15:05.169" style="s2">use and for multicultural systems use</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.989" end="00:15:07.329" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.169" end="00:15:11.079" style="s2">Orientis tissues of justice and fairness</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.329" end="00:15:12.669" style="s2">and those can empower so what you see in</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.079" end="00:15:14.259" style="s2">all of these different approaches are a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.669" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">lot of really good key insight</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.259" end="00:15:18.519" style="s2">my mind the way my you know I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:20.499" style="s2">a coherent estat you might have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.519" end="00:15:22.629" style="s2">some something like I really seek big</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.499" end="00:15:24.519" style="s2">picture of coherence and it bothered me</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.629" end="00:15:26.109" style="s2">it really just bothered me that you had</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.519" end="00:15:27.879" style="s2">all these different paradigms that had</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.109" end="00:15:29.139" style="s2">key insights but there were to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.879" end="00:15:31.449" style="s2">they&#39;re like different instruments</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.139" end="00:15:33.549" style="s2">playing important parts of the tune but</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.449" end="00:15:36.699" style="s2">there was no orchestra there was no real</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.549" end="00:15:38.410" style="s2">music and then I said well if it is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.699" end="00:15:40.299" style="s2">case that there are these key insights</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.410" end="00:15:42.489" style="s2">then why shouldn&#39;t they actually be</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.299" end="00:15:44.109" style="s2">anchored to our scientific understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.489" end="00:15:46.209" style="s2">which should at least be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.109" end="00:15:48.459" style="s2">elucidate those insights and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.209" end="00:15:50.350" style="s2">the problems psychotherapy that got me</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.459" end="00:15:52.119" style="s2">then wondering whether or not there was</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.350" end="00:15:54.249" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t this all be anchored to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.119" end="00:15:55.689" style="s2">human psychology and then when I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.249" end="00:15:57.429" style="s2">asked that question that&#39;s what I really</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.689" end="00:15:58.899" style="s2">I returned at graduate school to this</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.429" end="00:16:00.429" style="s2">issue about what is psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.899" end="00:16:02.559" style="s2">that&#39;s when it really dawned on me know</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.429" end="00:16:04.899" style="s2">psychology can&#39;t provide it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.559" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">a fragmented mess there is no singular</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.899" end="00:16:09.699" style="s2">psychology it&#39;s really a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:11.799" style="s2">empirical enterprises on different</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.699" end="00:16:13.479" style="s2">slices of the human condition but it has</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.799" end="00:16:15.819" style="s2">no position to provide an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.479" end="00:16:17.829" style="s2">understanding either so then I was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.819" end="00:16:19.720" style="s2">oh well that and that drew my attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.829" end="00:16:21.609" style="s2">and I got into that we can talk some</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.720" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2">about that history but it was always in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.609" end="00:16:26.049" style="s2">the surface of coming back to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.980" end="00:16:28.239" style="s2">picture of understanding that could</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.049" end="00:16:29.679" style="s2">inform what I call psychological doctors</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.239" end="00:16:31.209" style="s2">just so people can be clear about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.679" end="00:16:33.069" style="s2">clinical side if you&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.209" end="00:16:34.899" style="s2">psychological doctoring we want a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.069" end="00:16:37.179" style="s2">model of human psychology for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.899" end="00:16:39.039" style="s2">science so I&#39;m always working thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.179" end="00:16:41.410" style="s2">about what&#39;s my model of the science and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.039" end="00:16:43.779" style="s2">then how do I apply that ethically and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.410" end="00:16:45.999" style="s2">effectively in the real world and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.779" end="00:16:47.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what I actually twelve years I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.999" end="00:16:50.230" style="s2">was director of the combined integrated</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.919" end="00:16:52.089" style="s2">doctoral program at JMU it&#39;s a primarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.230" end="00:16:53.919" style="s2">practitioner oriented program so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.089" end="00:16:56.319" style="s2">vast majority of my students are really</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.919" end="00:16:58.389" style="s2">learned from me mostly how to do work in</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.319" end="00:17:00.850" style="s2">the clinical room and the unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.389" end="00:17:03.249" style="s2">services backdrop to inform us ways to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.850" end="00:17:04.990" style="s2">weave together the key insights so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.249" end="00:17:06.549" style="s2">we could be the best practitioners that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.990" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">we can be and be informed by</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.549" end="00:17:09.730" style="s2">evidence-based principles that know how</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:11.409" style="s2">to apply them because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.730" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">sophisticated understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.409" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">science okay so the unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:20.649" style="s2">itself is a me unifying the components</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:23.079" style="s2">of the science but always with having in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.649" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">mind the clinical potential is that a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.079" end="00:17:27.010" style="s2">fair way to say it or did I over say it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:27.800" style="s2">no that&#39;s exactly right and in fact I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.010" end="00:17:29.630" style="s2">say that what</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.800" end="00:17:31.430" style="s2">happens once you sort of learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.630" end="00:17:33.620" style="s2">speak the language of the unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.430" end="00:17:34.910" style="s2">of psychology what gives rise to then is</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.620" end="00:17:37.040" style="s2">the unified approach I&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.910" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">really quick synopsis of exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.040" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">that bridge is made so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">that or a unified theory oriented me</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">towards is how to build a model of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">mental systems and what emerged out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:48.800" style="s2">that is that there actually we can look</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">at human mental systems in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.800" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">layered evolutionary layered systems of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.700" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">adaptation and anybody thinks in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:17:57.740" style="s2">of complex adaptive systems should</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.750" style="s2">appreciate the word adaptation here and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.740" end="00:18:01.310" style="s2">what we get actually is essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.750" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">I call the procedural habit system</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.310" end="00:18:05.780" style="s2">basically gets laid down first then what</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.340" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">emerges out of that is really in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.780" end="00:18:11.330" style="s2">perceptual emotional feeling system that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">guides the the organ animal and learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.330" end="00:18:15.560" style="s2">environments then what evolves out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">that is a relationship system that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.560" end="00:18:19.130" style="s2">really focuses on things like attachment</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.140" style="s2">and your drives for power love and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:24.020" style="s2">freedom and then on the top of that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.140" end="00:18:26.540" style="s2">get a first an imagining cortical system</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.020" end="00:18:29.030" style="s2">that runs through various situations and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.540" end="00:18:32.120" style="s2">then finally a justification system on</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.030" end="00:18:34.220" style="s2">top of that well if we then that&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.120" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a unified theory approach then we</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.220" end="00:18:38.210" style="s2">look at those different systems see the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:40.490" style="s2">behaviors were really basically focused</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.210" end="00:18:42.560" style="s2">on how people formed habits and engaged</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.490" end="00:18:44.570" style="s2">in sort of automatic responses given the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.560" end="00:18:46.310" style="s2">environmental contingencies the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.570" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2">humanists were actually focused and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.310" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">indeed more modern humanists are called</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.870" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">emotion focus therapists they focus on</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:54.470" style="s2">the core of your emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:55.790" style="s2">and how that organizes your psyche or if</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.470" end="00:18:57.140" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how to process your</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.790" end="00:18:57.530" style="s2">feelings how you get all tangled up</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.140" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.530" end="00:19:02.600" style="s2">thus modern psychodynamic people focus</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:04.790" style="s2">on relationships like attachment and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.600" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">you get anxious in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.790" end="00:19:08.060" style="s2">attachment and then you start engaging</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:10.550" style="s2">in psychological defenses and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.060" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">finally people like back the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.550" end="00:19:14.180" style="s2">therapist as well as the existential</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">philosophers they really focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.180" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">system of justification that language</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:21.170" style="s2">based meaning making system so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:22.490" style="s2">unified theory divides the human mental</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.170" end="00:19:24.410" style="s2">system up into these systems of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.490" end="00:19:26.300" style="s2">adaptation and then it basically says</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.410" end="00:19:28.520" style="s2">hey what has been focused on by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.300" end="00:19:30.770" style="s2">paradigms in psychotherapy really are</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.520" end="00:19:32.390" style="s2">these different systems of adaptation so</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.770" end="00:19:34.910" style="s2">we can draw an analogy with modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.390" end="00:19:36.860" style="s2">medicine modern medicine in Western</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.910" end="00:19:38.870" style="s2">medicine is relatively well unified and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.860" end="00:19:39.620" style="s2">the reason is we have a basically decent</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.870" end="00:19:41.480" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.620" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">and I mean decent and a scientific sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.480" end="00:19:46.280" style="s2">of human biology we recognize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:48.410" style="s2">nested into these various hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.280" end="00:19:50.270" style="s2">you start it cells cells organize into</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.410" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">organ systems and all these organ</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.270" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">systems coordinate to create the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:56.360" style="s2">organism as a whole and and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:19:58.550" style="s2">human biology does and if you go see a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.360" end="00:20:00.290" style="s2">generalist biological practitioner he</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.550" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">assesses your systems and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.290" end="00:20:04.970" style="s2">have a specific deficit you might see a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">specialist well the analogy in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.970" end="00:20:09.050" style="s2">psychology is we never would see a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:11.000" style="s2">cardiologist coming out and saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.050" end="00:20:13.910" style="s2">the key to human health is cardiology</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.000" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">and no the anthropologist says no the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.910" end="00:20:17.420" style="s2">key is all of your hormones I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:19.429" style="s2">nobody thinks like that because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.420" end="00:20:21.650" style="s2">recognize it&#39;s the whole system well the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.429" end="00:20:23.240" style="s2">same basic this analogy holds what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.650" end="00:20:25.370" style="s2">arguing here in psychology is that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.240" end="00:20:27.590" style="s2">the paradigms have done the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.370" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">for the cognitivists the humanists they</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.590" end="00:20:32.360" style="s2">have focused on domains of adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.620" end="00:20:34.070" style="s2">without being able to see the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.360" end="00:20:35.630" style="s2">unified theory sees the whole and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.070" end="00:20:37.550" style="s2">it sees how these different key insights</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.630" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">can go together with a picture and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.550" end="00:20:41.630" style="s2">creates that bridge between the unified</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:42.980" style="s2">theory and at least a key aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.630" end="00:20:44.929" style="s2">practice which is how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.980" end="00:20:48.470" style="s2">understand individuals problems and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.929" end="00:20:51.080" style="s2">entrapped in the maladaptive sight okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.470" end="00:20:52.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good introduction so and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.080" end="00:20:53.780" style="s2">you started to answer this but I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.820" end="00:20:56.030" style="s2">you a chance to go into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.780" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">more detail on it why do we need a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.030" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">unified theory of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:01.730" style="s2">you mentioned biology and it&#39;s an area I</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">know more about the night well I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.730" end="00:21:05.240" style="s2">probably know more psychology these days</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:06.620" style="s2">in biology but I used to know more</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.240" end="00:21:08.840" style="s2">biology and one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.620" end="00:21:12.650" style="s2">biology is they&#39;re still not really a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.840" end="00:21:14.179" style="s2">deep theory of biology and the many</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.650" end="00:21:15.980" style="s2">biology departments don&#39;t even have any</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.179" end="00:21:18.950" style="s2">theorists though they&#39;re starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.980" end="00:21:22.010" style="s2">them and they&#39;re often ostracized and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.950" end="00:21:23.510" style="s2">made fun of by the by other biologists</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.010" end="00:21:25.640" style="s2">who the course the theorists refer to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.510" end="00:21:28.580" style="s2">them as the but encounter so even in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.640" end="00:21:30.770" style="s2">biology it&#39;s it&#39;s not so far along as as</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.580" end="00:21:32.990" style="s2">you might think so first why do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.770" end="00:21:35.990" style="s2">think we need a unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.990" end="00:21:38.900" style="s2">psychology and what are possible risks</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.990" end="00:21:40.490" style="s2">or why not go after a unified theory you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.900" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">know maybe it&#39;s too early maybe it could</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.490" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">have some bad effects etc one take on</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">both of those questions kind of together</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:48.740" style="s2">sure so the first thing I&#39;ll say is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.220" style="s2">absolutely I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really there</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.740" end="00:21:53.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t it complete by any</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.220" end="00:21:55.650" style="s2">right unified theory of biology however</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.159" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">if you go to the history of biology you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.650" end="00:22:00.360" style="s2">see a dramatic emergence that happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">in the 1920s and 30s what was that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.360" end="00:22:05.010" style="s2">called the modern evolutionary synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:05.730" style="s2">where biologists put together natural</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.010" end="00:22:08.309" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.730" end="00:22:10.620" style="s2">with genetics in particular population</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.309" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">genetics to give rise to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.620" end="00:22:14.970" style="s2">natural suction operated on genetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:17.370" style="s2">combinations over generations to give</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.970" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">rise to the complexity we see emerging</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.370" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">through the evolutionary process that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:24.299" style="s2">modern evolutionary synthesis the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:27.390" style="s2">transition from when you had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.299" end="00:22:29.309" style="s2">macro mutation genetics and gradualist</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.390" end="00:22:32.250" style="s2">natural selection is working in that in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.309" end="00:22:34.110" style="s2">the in naturalistic settings there was</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.250" end="00:22:36.120" style="s2">this chaos between those systems well</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.110" end="00:22:38.309" style="s2">that modern unification happened and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.120" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">there was an enormous amount of advances</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.309" end="00:22:42.960" style="s2">now I believe that there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:44.490" style="s2">advances to occur I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.960" end="00:22:46.500" style="s2">really cell physiology</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.490" end="00:22:48.150" style="s2">I think epidemics is going to teach us a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.500" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">lot about biology and I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.150" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">were still and some major discoveries to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:54.270" style="s2">give rise to we and we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:56.580" style="s2">really understand what gave rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.270" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">actual origin of life so don&#39;t get me</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.580" end="00:23:01.020" style="s2">wrong there&#39;s a lot of confusion still</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:03.179" style="s2">to be had but if you put together cell</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.020" end="00:23:04.950" style="s2">physiology genetics and natural</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.179" end="00:23:07.650" style="s2">selection and you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.950" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">concept of life corresponding to biology</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.650" end="00:23:12.809" style="s2">what you see is a lot more consensus</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:15.330" style="s2">coherence and organizing around the core</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.809" end="00:23:16.710" style="s2">of the discipline and in fact sociology</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.330" end="00:23:19.049" style="s2">of scientific knowledge will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.710" end="00:23:20.850" style="s2">actually consensual core is a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.049" end="00:23:23.730" style="s2">really important thing in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.850" end="00:23:25.890" style="s2">science actually produces periodic table</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.730" end="00:23:28.020" style="s2">of the elements unbelievably powerful in</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.890" end="00:23:30.840" style="s2">terms of it&#39;s consensual for natural</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.020" end="00:23:33.169" style="s2">selection genetics cell theory very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.840" end="00:23:36.150" style="s2">powerful and I call it&#39;s a unified</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:42.179" style="s2">you get into a psychology and you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.570" end="00:23:44.789" style="s2">basically chaos at the level of very</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.179" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">little that se10 psychologists would</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.789" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">agree on us the core now what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">happened your point about the concern</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:53.909" style="s2">about this okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.590" style="s2">is actually rampant in psychology there</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.909" end="00:23:57.750" style="s2">was actually a study that did in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.590" end="00:23:59.549" style="s2">of people&#39;s disposition on how much they</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.750" end="00:24:01.470" style="s2">hated Authority how independent they</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.549" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">were how autonomous and psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.470" end="00:24:03.650" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:06.290" style="s2">scored the highest of any discipline in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.650" end="00:24:07.490" style="s2">their resistance to Authority and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.290" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">certainly can relate to that I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.490" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">resistant to Authority so what do I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:13.160" style="s2">actually mean well why do I bring this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:14.990" style="s2">up is because everybody&#39;s afraid in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.160" end="00:24:15.650" style="s2">this has been the primary reaction to my</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.990" end="00:24:18.350" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.650" end="00:24:21.500" style="s2">oh no there will be a dominant hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.350" end="00:24:23.510" style="s2">that pit that will create a sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.500" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">insistence that anybody that questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.510" end="00:24:28.010" style="s2">it or if you don&#39;t use the language you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:30.500" style="s2">will be controlled and so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.010" end="00:24:31.880" style="s2">concern that this hegemony would emerge</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.500" end="00:24:35.210" style="s2">and then that we would everyone would</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.880" end="00:24:37.550" style="s2">have to be submitting to some Authority</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.210" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">that gets institutionalized with power</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.550" end="00:24:41.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very real concern listen I</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:43.730" style="s2">you know I think it happened someone in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.810" end="00:24:45.980" style="s2">economics I think economics and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.730" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">desire for mathematize ation hooked onto</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.980" end="00:24:50.450" style="s2">rational economic man and created</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:51.860" style="s2">mathematical models that actually then</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.450" end="00:24:54.230" style="s2">became the core of the discipline that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.860" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">were but that was problematic in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.230" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">ways because it&#39;s sort of its idealized</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:24:59.900" style="s2">a thing that actually wasn&#39;t true and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:01.340" style="s2">then forced individuals into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.900" end="00:25:03.800" style="s2">particular model is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.340" end="00:25:06.710" style="s2">problematic anyway the point is is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.800" end="00:25:08.390" style="s2">psychologists argue for a lot of concern</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.710" end="00:25:09.860" style="s2">about unification they&#39;re terrified that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.390" end="00:25:13.190" style="s2">created totalitarians were</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.860" end="00:25:14.660" style="s2">institutionalized top-down he&#39;ll my</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.190" end="00:25:15.170" style="s2">reaction to that should well just look</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.660" end="00:25:16.550" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.170" end="00:25:18.800" style="s2">clearly you&#39;re always going to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.550" end="00:25:21.290" style="s2">issues of you know everywhere you look</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.800" end="00:25:22.850" style="s2">as anybody from a complexity background</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.290" end="00:25:25.310" style="s2">would know you have the dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.850" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">tension between order and chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.310" end="00:25:29.060" style="s2">certainly we don&#39;t want so much order</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">that everybody has to submit to some</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.060" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">unified theory that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:35.300" style="s2">antithetical to all the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:37.010" style="s2">science but at the same time if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.300" end="00:25:39.260" style="s2">so much chaos and so much fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.010" end="00:25:41.210" style="s2">that there&#39;s no consensual core of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.260" end="00:25:43.610" style="s2">discipline well then we got a problem on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:46.010" style="s2">the chaos side and I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.610" end="00:25:47.740" style="s2">really a thrust a warranted thrust to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.010" end="00:25:50.750" style="s2">look for more integrated unifying</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.740" end="00:25:52.430" style="s2">proposals okay I make a little sidebar</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.440" end="00:26:16.350" style="s2">yeah actually they&#39;ve completely info</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.550" end="00:26:19.230" style="s2">traded the practice side of the house in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.350" end="00:26:21.240" style="s2">many ways I would argue that the that</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.430" end="00:27:17.370" style="s2">show know that I am highly skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:19.410" style="s2">post-modernism particularly if one tries</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.410" end="00:27:23.970" style="s2">stance it has some benefit I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.990" end="00:27:26.790" style="s2">are certainly some things wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.970" end="00:27:29.010" style="s2">modernism that need to be corrected but</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.790" end="00:27:30.900" style="s2">to my mind trying to turn post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.010" end="00:27:34.500" style="s2">into a way of behaving would be like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.900" end="00:27:36.660" style="s2">hiring a academic literary critic to run</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.500" end="00:27:40.620" style="s2">a movie studio it&#39;s just like what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.660" end="00:27:43.110" style="s2"> right you and I have very similar</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.620" end="00:27:45.030" style="s2">views on that in the sense that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.110" end="00:27:46.590" style="s2">actually I do really found my learned</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.030" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">and I know you&#39;ve had Ponzi Fry knocked</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.590" end="00:27:50.910" style="s2">on your show now I think several times I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:52.980" style="s2">actually you&#39;re you&#39;re so ago I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.910" end="00:27:54.840" style="s2">discovered the meta modern version of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.980" end="00:27:57.510" style="s2">reality that spoke to me very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.840" end="00:27:59.640" style="s2">deeply at least in the sense that when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.510" end="00:28:01.860" style="s2">use what I call my system was integrated</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.640" end="00:28:04.590" style="s2">and I realized I was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.860" end="00:28:07.410" style="s2">transcending what I thought was a strict</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.590" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">empiricism which really was a at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.410" end="00:28:10.980" style="s2">in psychology and modernist sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:13.050" style="s2">on the science side of the house and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:14.850" style="s2">then you had this massive critical view</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.050" end="00:28:16.890" style="s2">which was very important to have believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.850" end="00:28:18.570" style="s2">me on I can articulate a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.890" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">reasons to be critical and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.570" end="00:28:22.710" style="s2">sure you say that but as a constructed</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:25.140" style="s2">vantage point it breaks down really</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.710" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">quick exactly you know what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.140" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:30.019" style="s2">a greater holistic view that takes the</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.019" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">view but also anchors it to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:36.409" style="s2">coherent view that says hey know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.639" style="s2">an accurate way to build reality models</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.409" end="00:28:39.409" style="s2">of reality which is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.639" end="00:28:41.419" style="s2">essential feature of a scientific view</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.409" end="00:28:43.489" style="s2">is that yes there&#39;s reality out there we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.419" end="00:28:45.529" style="s2">can build models and we make them better</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.489" end="00:28:48.440" style="s2">through the empirical methodologies that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.529" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">we construct sounds exactly right to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.440" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">I mean you know my objection is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:53.899" style="s2">particularly to the extreme post</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:21.950" style="s2">was very interesting is you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.789" end="00:29:24.529" style="s2">about how you came up with the theory I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.950" end="00:29:26.809" style="s2">think I called it my notes signs of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.529" end="00:29:28.369" style="s2">utility of a unified theory maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.809" end="00:29:29.749" style="s2">was your words I don&#39;t remember though</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.369" end="00:29:31.309" style="s2">you actually started seeing that these</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.749" end="00:29:33.710" style="s2">different perspectives started seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.309" end="00:29:35.749" style="s2">similar things if you could get their</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.710" end="00:29:37.159" style="s2">verbiage out of the way right could you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.749" end="00:29:38.659" style="s2">talk a little bit about this how you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.159" end="00:29:41.359" style="s2">started seeing the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.659" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">perspectives were actually saying a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.359" end="00:29:45.889" style="s2">of things that overlapped yeah I started</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:46.850" style="s2">to feel that way in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.889" end="00:29:48.350" style="s2">although they were singing different</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.850" end="00:29:50.119" style="s2">tunes I started to feel that way when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.350" end="00:29:52.249" style="s2">was doing the psychotherapy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.119" end="00:29:53.720" style="s2">angle and experiencing this in the room</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.249" end="00:29:56.090" style="s2">and saying well okay I can emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.720" end="00:29:58.309" style="s2">this in this a little bit but man they</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.090" end="00:29:59.989" style="s2">really do say a lot of the similar</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.309" end="00:30:02.779" style="s2">things just using different verbage</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.989" end="00:30:03.830" style="s2">so that set me up to be seeking and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.779" end="00:30:05.809" style="s2">the other thing which by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.830" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">connects to the postmodern dynamic the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.809" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">really transformational moment that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:11.509" style="s2">happened to me was so then I&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:14.509" style="s2">moved over and asked what psychology</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.509" end="00:30:16.730" style="s2">really might be my first love in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.509" end="00:30:18.769" style="s2">when I was in this quest was for an out</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.730" end="00:30:20.809" style="s2">with an evolutionary psychological view</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.769" end="00:30:22.190" style="s2">which I was very fascinated about and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.809" end="00:30:24.739" style="s2">then I started to read lots of big</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.190" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">picture thinkers Steve Pinker and other</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.739" end="00:30:29.239" style="s2">individuals that were you know blending</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:31.100" style="s2">evolutionary and neo-darwinian and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.239" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">cognitive science are used together but</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.100" end="00:30:35.090" style="s2">I started to feel that they didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:38.390" style="s2">have the whole picture and then I had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.090" end="00:30:41.990" style="s2">my first real lightbulb moment late 1996</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.390" end="00:30:45.230" style="s2">into 1997 which would become what I call</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.990" end="00:30:47.870" style="s2">now justification systems theory so</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.230" end="00:30:49.910" style="s2">justification systems theory is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.870" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">which helps us understand how we went</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.910" end="00:30:53.810" style="s2">from primates which we basically work I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">mean we use tools all right but say a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.810" end="00:30:57.980" style="s2">million years ago we&#39;re basically very</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">similar to other primates and even up to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.980" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">a front maybe 150 thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:04.250" style="s2">were very similar and really over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.980" style="s2">last 50 thousand years we have seen just</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.250" end="00:31:08.870" style="s2">a dramatic change in both are in our</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">mentation and our tool use and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.870" end="00:31:11.930" style="s2">we&#39;re doing to the planet and of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">every year that change seems to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.930" end="00:31:16.160" style="s2">accelerate but what I realized with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.480" style="s2">justification hypothesis would and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.160" end="00:31:20.260" style="s2">can get into some of the details but</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.480" end="00:31:23.210" style="s2">basically the idea it was oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.260" end="00:31:25.970" style="s2">language gives rise to this problem of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.210" end="00:31:27.560" style="s2">justification and then inside of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.970" end="00:31:29.930" style="s2">there&#39;s an even more important problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.560" end="00:31:31.310" style="s2">or really very relevant problem for our</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.930" end="00:31:33.920" style="s2">human psychology called the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.310" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">social justification which basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.920" end="00:31:37.310" style="s2">refers to how do you explain to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:39.650" style="s2">important others why you&#39;re doing what</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.310" end="00:31:41.060" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and that sets up all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.650" end="00:31:42.950" style="s2">of different interesting both problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.060" end="00:31:45.410" style="s2">and what I thought were very profound</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.950" end="00:31:47.150" style="s2">selection pressures on our self</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.410" end="00:31:48.770" style="s2">consciousness system and I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.150" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">argue that the problem of social</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.770" end="00:31:53.210" style="s2">justification really shapes our self</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:55.250" style="s2">consciousness system both in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.210" end="00:31:58.100" style="s2">evolution and actually in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.250" end="00:32:00.560" style="s2">we learn to be who we are but what that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.100" end="00:32:03.260" style="s2">did that language this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.560" end="00:32:05.060" style="s2">justification systems actually all of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.260" end="00:32:06.920" style="s2">sudden what that does is when you start</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.060" end="00:32:09.050" style="s2">to think about what humans produce in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.920" end="00:32:12.200" style="s2">these different paradigms as different</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.050" end="00:32:15.170" style="s2">systems of justification that gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.200" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">to a way of thinking about things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.170" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">allows us to see parallels and and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">for if we go back to post-modernism not</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">to get on back on the hobbyhorse there</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:25.520" style="s2">but what actually what I tell everybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:26.990" style="s2">is yes there are different systems of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.520" end="00:32:28.940" style="s2">justification that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:31.040" style="s2">identifying and people are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.940" end="00:32:32.900" style="s2">different systems of justification now</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.040" end="00:32:34.700" style="s2">the idea that we can then not judge</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.900" end="00:32:36.620" style="s2">whether or not certain systems of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.700" end="00:32:39.140" style="s2">justification have better coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.620" end="00:32:40.910" style="s2">correspondence accuracy relative to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:43.130" style="s2">reality well that&#39;s where I would differ</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">dramatically but I would say that yes we</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.130" end="00:32:46.940" style="s2">are all operating under different</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:49.070" style="s2">systems of justification and I argued my</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.940" end="00:32:50.830" style="s2">unified theory and indeed scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.070" end="00:32:53.190" style="s2">knowledge can be thought of as a system</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.830" end="00:32:55.059" style="s2">of justification it just has a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.190" end="00:32:57.250" style="s2">epistemology and ontology</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.059" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">in terms of how it bill but once you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.250" end="00:33:02.110" style="s2">introduce this language of justification</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:04.120" style="s2">systems then you actually move to a meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.110" end="00:33:06.309" style="s2">level around human belief that I find to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.120" end="00:33:07.750" style="s2">be very useful in juxtaposing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.309" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">corresponding different belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.750" end="00:33:11.830" style="s2">together to see how they both overlap</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:14.860" style="s2">and to see where the real differences</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.830" end="00:33:16.630" style="s2">are as well very good we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:18.820" style="s2">justification I polished this a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.630" end="00:33:21.130" style="s2">bit more detail but before we go there</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.820" end="00:33:23.380" style="s2">let&#39;s go with with for my reading of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.130" end="00:33:25.809" style="s2">appears to be the foundation that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.380" end="00:33:27.159" style="s2">can apply to nonhumans and again I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.809" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">thought some things I liked about your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.159" end="00:33:33.190" style="s2">theory is that it relatively seamlessly</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">applied to both nonhumans and humans but</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.190" end="00:33:37.570" style="s2">without trivializing the gigantic gulf</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:39.789" style="s2">between them right this is one things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.570" end="00:33:41.470" style="s2">i&#39;ve argued fair amount at Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.789" end="00:33:44.409" style="s2">Institute that there is a bright line</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.470" end="00:33:46.120" style="s2">between advanced Homo sapiens whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.409" end="00:33:47.799" style="s2">that means exactly and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.120" end="00:33:48.850" style="s2">came before that while there are a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.799" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">number of people who say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.850" end="00:33:52.899" style="s2">horseshit that&#39;s more or less</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.070" style="s2">continuously variable but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.899" end="00:33:57.130" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.070" end="00:34:00.100" style="s2">happened when we got the full symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.130" end="00:34:02.049" style="s2">maybe recursive if you take Chomsky your</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.100" end="00:34:03.909" style="s2">point of view and before and after are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.049" end="00:34:06.309" style="s2">just different universes no by the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.909" end="00:34:07.750" style="s2">the ruddy and hypothesis I&#39;ve I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.309" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually narrowed down the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.750" end="00:34:11.320" style="s2">when it must have happened a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:13.899" style="s2">better than some okay you know I say it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.320" end="00:34:16.510" style="s2">happened no later than sixty-five</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.899" end="00:34:18.700" style="s2">thousand years ago no Earl I should say</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.510" end="00:34:20.230" style="s2">no earlier than sixty-five thousand</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.700" end="00:34:22.330" style="s2">years ago some people say forty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.230" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">and here&#39;s my argument for sixty-five</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.330" end="00:34:28.540" style="s2">the 67 thousand as the earliest that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.659" style="s2">could have occurred which is that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.540" end="00:34:34.119" style="s2">the Out of Africa event occurred at</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.659" end="00:34:36.609" style="s2">least the last out of africa event</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.119" end="00:34:39.849" style="s2">occurred when almost all non African</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.609" end="00:34:42.280" style="s2">people are descended when a single group</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.849" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">probably an extended family crossed down</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.280" end="00:34:47.290" style="s2">at the bottom of Saudi Arabia from</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:49.060" style="s2">Somalia and then moved along the coast</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.290" end="00:34:51.010" style="s2">populate the whole world well guess what</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.060" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">people on both sides of that divide</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.010" end="00:34:57.310" style="s2">appear to have fully modern brains with</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.780" style="s2">full language and syntax so therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.310" end="00:35:00.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know why this theory hadn&#39;t been</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.220" end="00:35:08.109" style="s2">king of the modern mind occurred it had</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.800" end="00:35:10.510" style="s2">to happen before the out of africa event</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.109" end="00:35:12.369" style="s2">which is around sixty five sixty seven</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.510" end="00:35:14.109" style="s2">thousand years ago depending on on who</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.369" end="00:35:16.510" style="s2">you talk to so that&#39;s a sort of an FYI</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.109" end="00:35:18.760" style="s2">so anyway let&#39;s jump into your</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.510" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">behavioral investment theory and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.760" end="00:35:24.099" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back and talk some more about</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:26.859" style="s2">justification hypothesis perfect yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.099" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">this is a behavioral vestment theory so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.859" end="00:35:30.369" style="s2">and all of this sits in the architecture</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.290" style="s2">of what&#39;s called the the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.369" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">knowledge which will do two but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.290" end="00:35:37.180" style="s2">the the argument is here is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:38.890" style="s2">a fundamental difference in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.180" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">behavior that we see exhibited by</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.890" end="00:35:44.920" style="s2">animals relative to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:46.540" style="s2">living world so animals are radically</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.920" end="00:35:48.490" style="s2">different they are of course organisms</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.540" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">so they carry all of what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.490" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">plants and cells but they do this other</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.680" end="00:35:53.560" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">aristotle identified it a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.560" end="00:35:57.790" style="s2">as you know in terms of sun sensorimotor</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:36:00.730" style="s2">functional awareness and response</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.790" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">basically that animals engage in and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.730" end="00:36:04.900" style="s2">i argue that what happened then we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:07.090" style="s2">really see it in the evolution of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.900" end="00:36:08.890" style="s2">we see the Cambrian explosion so then</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.090" end="00:36:11.080" style="s2">the issue is well what really is going</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.890" end="00:36:12.520" style="s2">on in relationship to this and i go</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.080" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">straight back into things like energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.520" end="00:36:16.990" style="s2">economics and movement and argue</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:19.030" style="s2">basically what you see with animals is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.990" end="00:36:20.410" style="s2">that they&#39;re heterotrophs heterotrophs</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.030" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">means that they have to actually eat</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.410" end="00:36:25.030" style="s2">other things they don&#39;t get their energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:27.220" style="s2">directly and that makes them motile they</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.030" end="00:36:29.859" style="s2">have to move around and this problem of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.220" end="00:36:31.810" style="s2">movement is enormous and ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.859" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">you get is you get the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.810" end="00:36:36.790" style="s2">and muscular control system in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.859" style="s2">body system that is good for approaching</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.790" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">that which is good and avoiding that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.859" end="00:36:42.760" style="s2">which is bad to put it in the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.170" style="s2">simple terms and what behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.760" end="00:36:46.180" style="s2">investment theory is then is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.170" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">actually it&#39;s a meta theory and what a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.180" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">meta theory i mean it has a set of six</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:52.900" style="s2">principles principles of energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.369" style="s2">economics the principle of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.900" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">meaning that it happens to be a natural</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.369" end="00:36:57.820" style="s2">selection principle of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:00.220" style="s2">genetics meaning that just genetic</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.820" end="00:37:01.810" style="s2">inference influences or individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.220" end="00:37:03.460" style="s2">differences the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.810" end="00:37:04.750" style="s2">computational control which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.460" end="00:37:07.000" style="s2">nervous system operates as an</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.750" end="00:37:09.160" style="s2">information system the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.000" end="00:37:11.020" style="s2">learning and adaptation which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.160" end="00:37:13.060" style="s2">basically how the organism adjusts based</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.020" end="00:37:14.980" style="s2">on feedback and contingency over time</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.060" end="00:37:16.600" style="s2">and then finally the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.980" end="00:37:19.420" style="s2">development which is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.600" end="00:37:20.680" style="s2">life stage history and adolescents are</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:23.980" style="s2">going to have different patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.680" end="00:37:25.570" style="s2">investment than adults and youth so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.980" end="00:37:28.540" style="s2">depending on where you are in your</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.570" end="00:37:30.310" style="s2">developmental stage so you put those six</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.540" end="00:37:31.990" style="s2">principles together and then you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.310" end="00:37:33.670" style="s2">organize that you say well what actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.990" end="00:37:35.530" style="s2">is the nervous system trying to do the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.670" end="00:37:38.050" style="s2">nervous system evolves as an investment</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.530" end="00:37:40.780" style="s2">value system that&#39;s trying to predict</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.050" end="00:37:42.460" style="s2">contingencies and guide the system for</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.780" end="00:37:43.900" style="s2">particular kinds of outcomes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.460" end="00:37:45.940" style="s2">basically what it says so it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.900" end="00:37:47.740" style="s2">behavioral investment theory and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.940" end="00:37:49.750" style="s2">basically emphasizes that the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.740" end="00:37:51.160" style="s2">the animal as a whole is an investment</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.750" end="00:37:53.590" style="s2">and what you&#39;re trying to do is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.160" end="00:37:55.210" style="s2">trying to control resources control the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.590" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">flow of resources and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.210" end="00:37:58.810" style="s2">regulating investment and what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.630" style="s2">means is we should see the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.810" end="00:38:03.340" style="s2">animal investment really understood as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.630" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">function of phylogeny meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.340" end="00:38:07.570" style="s2">evolutionary history of the species the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.340" style="s2">unique genetic predispositions that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.570" end="00:38:10.930" style="s2">particular animal has and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.340" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">epigenetic and I mean that the broad</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.930" end="00:38:15.070" style="s2">sense epigenetic life history and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">relationships of contingencies and cost</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.070" end="00:38:19.660" style="s2">benefits and then has it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.970" style="s2">decision in the moment based on rewards</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.660" end="00:38:23.800" style="s2">cost opportunity costs things along</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.970" end="00:38:25.690" style="s2">those lines and that creates a meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.800" end="00:38:28.590" style="s2">theoretical framework for IR view</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.690" end="00:38:30.820" style="s2">ethology sociobiology behavioral ecology</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.590" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">comparative psychology and the like and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.820" end="00:38:34.540" style="s2">it provides a framework for us to really</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:37.300" style="s2">think about what I would like to call</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.540" end="00:38:39.340" style="s2">the animal mind sciences let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.300" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">an example and let you apply the theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.340" end="00:38:44.200" style="s2">happen today my wife and I were going</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">out to eat lunch on our beautiful front</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.200" end="00:38:48.280" style="s2">porch here at the farm and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.740" style="s2">trying to get a beat on a goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.280" end="00:38:52.660" style="s2">groundhog that&#39;s been hitting the edges</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.740" end="00:38:54.700" style="s2">of our garden and over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.660" end="00:38:56.650" style="s2">years the wife and I basically wiped out</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.700" end="00:38:59.800" style="s2">the groundhogs out to a distance of at</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.650" end="00:39:02.500" style="s2">least 250 yards from our core homestead</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:04.900" style="s2">but they inevitably sneak back in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.500" end="00:39:06.730" style="s2">and so I saw one a few days ago and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.900" end="00:39:08.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been on the on the warpath trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.730" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">to catch them so I go out to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.650" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">outside for get my lunch ago damn it</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:17.650" style="s2">house get my rifle and crank around in</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.890" end="00:39:19.390" style="s2">into the magazine get out there and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.650" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see me I get out slowly my wife</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.390" end="00:39:22.870" style="s2">comes from the other side the damn grad</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.850" style="s2">hog sees it flies off deep into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.870" end="00:39:27.130" style="s2">woods so this is something I&#39;ve put in</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.850" end="00:39:29.470" style="s2">some of my own models of cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.130" end="00:39:30.790" style="s2">even models of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.470" end="00:39:33.670" style="s2">animals have this very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.790" end="00:39:35.859" style="s2">trade-off of wariness versus eating</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.670" end="00:39:37.750" style="s2">right you know what was the groundhog</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.859" end="00:39:40.450" style="s2">doing it was munching on some plants</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.750" end="00:39:42.190" style="s2">right and if you run off every time you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.450" end="00:39:43.270" style="s2">see anything move you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.190" end="00:39:45.609" style="s2">eat enough you&#39;re gonna starve to death</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.270" end="00:39:47.170" style="s2">on the other hand if you don&#39;t run off</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.609" end="00:39:49.840" style="s2">with the man with the gun shows up</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.170" end="00:39:52.119" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna die right so and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.840" end="00:39:53.830" style="s2">balance and individuals vary on where</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.119" end="00:39:55.420" style="s2">they are I mean some groundhogs just sit</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.830" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">there you shoot a boom yep</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.420" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">though I imagine we cleaned up that part</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.640" end="00:40:01.810" style="s2">of the gene pool with our multi-year war</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.700" style="s2">on groundhogs right and but this guy</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.810" end="00:40:05.080" style="s2">seemed to be pretty pretty well balanced</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.700" end="00:40:07.660" style="s2">right he didn&#39;t react to the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.080" end="00:40:08.859" style="s2">signal of me opening the door slowly so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.660" end="00:40:10.450" style="s2">I could come out with my rifle</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.859" end="00:40:11.830" style="s2">yeah but they did react to my wife</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.450" end="00:40:14.859" style="s2">coming around from the other side so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.830" end="00:40:16.420" style="s2">just for fun see if you can apply your</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.859" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">behavioral investment theory to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.420" end="00:40:21.910" style="s2">groundhog absolutely so what it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:24.460" style="s2">basically when the groundhog is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.910" end="00:40:26.859" style="s2">have it&#39;s got a perceptual system okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.460" end="00:40:29.080" style="s2">that&#39;s detecting affordances all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.859" end="00:40:31.330" style="s2">and a drive system that then identifies</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.080" end="00:40:33.310" style="s2">those as affordances so fortin&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.330" end="00:40:36.099" style="s2">something the environment that grants</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.310" end="00:40:38.619" style="s2">you some resource some benefit okay and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.099" end="00:40:40.150" style="s2">then it&#39;s tracking stressors a stressor</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.150" end="00:40:45.670" style="s2">threaten you damage you in particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.339" end="00:40:48.099" style="s2">ways okay and what it&#39;s got basically in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.670" end="00:40:50.410" style="s2">response to what it sees as a possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.099" end="00:40:52.690" style="s2">approach system that&#39;s a perception</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.410" end="00:40:55.780" style="s2">relative to its motion it then Prime&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.690" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s emotional reaction so an</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.780" end="00:41:01.660" style="s2">emotion is an energized motivational set</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:03.640" style="s2">a response set and basically what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.660" end="00:41:06.099" style="s2">going to get as it goes off to hunt</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.640" end="00:41:08.470" style="s2">something say especially if it also</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.099" end="00:41:11.170" style="s2">feels like it then can become a prey it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.470" end="00:41:13.630" style="s2">will have both a positive effect system</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.170" end="00:41:15.849" style="s2">of desire that moves towards the food</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.630" end="00:41:18.220" style="s2">and the seeking and consumption is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.849" end="00:41:20.619" style="s2">trying to optimally forage and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.220" end="00:41:22.540" style="s2">then activating a potential threat so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.619" end="00:41:24.940" style="s2">you&#39;re going to see I said as it moves</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.540" end="00:41:26.770" style="s2">out it&#39;s moving toward an acting</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.940" end="00:41:27.880" style="s2">approach however what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.770" end="00:41:29.290" style="s2">is it&#39;s also going to be tracking</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.880" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">potential threats so it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.290" end="00:41:33.010" style="s2">skittish little move and then it&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:34.660" style="s2">hunt around get the negative effects</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.010" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">system activated and then it will move</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.660" end="00:41:38.109" style="s2">around and be - in that dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:40.260" style="s2">then if it has you know something like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.109" end="00:41:41.980" style="s2">groundhog probably has pretty decent</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.260" end="00:41:43.079" style="s2">especially may be able to identify</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.980" end="00:41:45.569" style="s2">individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.079" end="00:41:47.369" style="s2">died maybe I&#39;ll identify an association</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.569" end="00:41:49.019" style="s2">with gunshot things like that in other</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.369" end="00:41:50.819" style="s2">words it would potentially be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.019" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2">identify a gun as a threat pretty tickle</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.819" end="00:41:54.569" style="s2">and certainly humans in general which of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.859" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">course their size and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.569" end="00:41:58.920" style="s2">history so it&#39;s scanning and I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:42:02.700" style="s2">actually argue if we if we measured its</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.920" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">brain activity its right brain ok would</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.700" end="00:42:07.019" style="s2">be more on their negative emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">avoidance I&#39;d it would be scanning its</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.019" end="00:42:12.749" style="s2">place and Gestalt and be more oriented</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:15.029" style="s2">to predation and it&#39;s left brain would</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.749" end="00:42:17.579" style="s2">be more oriented to honing in on figures</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.029" end="00:42:20.130" style="s2">in its relationship to what it might eat</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.579" end="00:42:21.869" style="s2">and oriented towards approach so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.130" end="00:42:24.089" style="s2">could probably actually see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.869" end="00:42:26.489" style="s2">orchestra of its brain in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.089" end="00:42:28.349" style="s2">approach avoidance of Gestalt and note</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.489" end="00:42:29.880" style="s2">opening in but when it picked you up</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.349" end="00:42:32.339" style="s2">then all of a sudden it could become</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.880" end="00:42:34.140" style="s2">prey it&#39;s gonna go obviously forego the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.339" end="00:42:36.390" style="s2">food immediately once it identifies a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.140" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">particular risk and then seek safety and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.390" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">you know virtually in all costs</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:42.660" style="s2">as I mentioned interestingly my</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:45.209" style="s2">experience is the individuals vary right</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.660" end="00:42:47.099" style="s2">in how weary they are yeah which makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.209" end="00:42:49.140" style="s2">sense for a population that&#39;s exposure</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.099" end="00:42:50.819" style="s2">because frankly there&#39;s a lot of houses</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.140" end="00:42:52.499" style="s2">you can afford day you go to the suburbs</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.819" end="00:42:54.119" style="s2">you can hang out and eat the eat the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.499" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">vegetables all day no one&#39;s gonna shoot</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.119" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">you come out here to the farm well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.640" style="s2">a different story entirely right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:01.589" style="s2">there&#39;s places that are near the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.640" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">the farm that are more like suburbia so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.589" end="00:43:05.219" style="s2">yeah so that that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:07.229" style="s2">yeah and in fact we know that actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.219" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">the and the Unified Theory actually cut</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.229" end="00:43:11.009" style="s2">lines directly up with this so if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.690" style="s2">look at mammals and you can go further</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.009" end="00:43:14.369" style="s2">and down the if you want to use that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:16.170" style="s2">term down the phylogenetic train then</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.369" end="00:43:18.180" style="s2">mammals but definitely with mammals you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.170" end="00:43:20.609" style="s2">see extraversion neuroticism and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.180" end="00:43:21.719" style="s2">agreeableness with social animals and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.609" end="00:43:23.369" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly how sociable</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.719" end="00:43:25.349" style="s2">groundhogs are but you would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.369" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">see extraversion that&#39;s the that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.349" end="00:43:29.910" style="s2">align with its positive effect system</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:32.549" style="s2">it&#39;s risk-taking and its energy directed</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.910" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">to toward and then neuroticism is its</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.549" end="00:43:35.699" style="s2">negative effect sensitivity so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:37.589" style="s2">skittish ones are going to be basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.699" end="00:43:39.059" style="s2">translated into higher otta system and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.589" end="00:43:40.890" style="s2">low extraversion will be high</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.059" end="00:43:42.839" style="s2">particularly skittish whereas high</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.890" end="00:43:44.699" style="s2">extraversion low neuroticism would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.839" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">the ones that are casual and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.699" end="00:43:47.699" style="s2">absolutely right you would expect a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:50.219" style="s2">frequency distribution along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.699" end="00:43:52.170" style="s2">because the cost/benefit lineup depends</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.219" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">tremendously on the situation and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.170" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:56.660" style="s2">so nature&#39;s gonna basically give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:58.790" style="s2">a wide variety of different behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.660" end="00:44:00.290" style="s2">genetic tendencies and different</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.790" end="00:44:02.450" style="s2">environments and indeed different</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.290" end="00:44:04.790" style="s2">changes of environment will make one</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.450" end="00:44:07.220" style="s2">advantageous in one context and another</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.790" end="00:44:09.080" style="s2">advantageous in another makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.220" end="00:44:10.520" style="s2">sense to me let&#39;s move on a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.080" end="00:44:12.740" style="s2">you know you take your behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.520" end="00:44:14.210" style="s2">investment theory and then you add on to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.740" end="00:44:16.340" style="s2">it for humans what you call the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.210" end="00:44:18.020" style="s2">influence matrix that&#39;s right did you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.340" end="00:44:19.480" style="s2">talk about that a little bit yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.020" end="00:44:22.280" style="s2">essentially so now you have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.480" end="00:44:24.200" style="s2">push-pull perception motivation emotion</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:26.450" style="s2">system as you&#39;re managing things like</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.200" end="00:44:28.369" style="s2">prey and predation and building</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.450" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">territory and then you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.369" end="00:44:32.780" style="s2">social mammals and I certainly did</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:34.190" style="s2">organize the influence matrix based on</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.780" end="00:44:35.750" style="s2">humans because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.190" end="00:44:37.400" style="s2">particularly relevant for a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.750" end="00:44:39.380" style="s2">clinical work we do and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.400" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2">human social motivation so it is a map</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.380" end="00:44:44.180" style="s2">of that I also want to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:46.820" style="s2">influence matrix does correspond to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.180" end="00:44:49.310" style="s2">lot of the social motives that we see</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.820" end="00:44:51.590" style="s2">especially in our primate cousins so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.310" end="00:44:53.210" style="s2">there&#39;s an enormous amount of overlap so</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.590" end="00:44:55.340" style="s2">what is the influence matrix</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.210" end="00:44:58.250" style="s2">well the influence matrix basically is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.340" end="00:45:00.980" style="s2">the idea that we have an architecture</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.250" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">for the social world that is that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.980" end="00:45:05.810" style="s2">become born seeking attachment what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:08.060" style="s2">attachment attachment we&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.810" end="00:45:10.580" style="s2">dependent creatures and attachment</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.060" end="00:45:13.100" style="s2">refers to the the dance and the cycle</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.580" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">that an individual a dependent has with</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.100" end="00:45:16.850" style="s2">their caregivers and what we look for</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:18.530" style="s2">from a light now say a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.850" end="00:45:20.030" style="s2">perspective is what ideally what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.530" end="00:45:22.130" style="s2">want is a secure attachment what does</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.030" end="00:45:24.440" style="s2">that mean it means that the infant is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.130" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">tracking the caregiver and the caregiver</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.440" end="00:45:29.270" style="s2">is tracking the infant in the court and</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:32.660" style="s2">relationship to a dance of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.270" end="00:45:34.730" style="s2">so if the infant has a need how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.660" end="00:45:36.980" style="s2">does the caregiver respond to that need</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.730" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2">what&#39;s the eye contact how much cuddling</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.980" end="00:45:42.050" style="s2">and holding is the need how well does</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">the caretaker track distress signals and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.050" end="00:45:47.900" style="s2">meet those needs or conversely how</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:49.820" style="s2">neglected or even abuse might the infant</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.900" end="00:45:53.180" style="s2">be indeed we learned about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.820" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">attachment system from John Bowlby who</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.180" end="00:45:58.220" style="s2">was the psychiatrist who saw orphaned</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.869" style="s2">infants basically get fed and protected</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.220" end="00:46:01.340" style="s2">physically from like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.869" end="00:46:03.950" style="s2">temperature and other kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.340" end="00:46:05.690" style="s2">but many many of these orphans infants</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.950" end="00:46:07.340" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.690" end="00:46:09.320" style="s2">golde enormous ly they had failure to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.340" end="00:46:11.600" style="s2">thrive they weren&#39;t and we realized that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.320" end="00:46:13.910" style="s2">actually crucial to the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.600" end="00:46:16.370" style="s2">is a need for socio emotional attachment</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.910" end="00:46:17.960" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s an articulation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.370" end="00:46:20.690" style="s2">attachment there is a great articulation</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.960" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">of animals and/or mammals in general and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.690" end="00:46:25.070" style="s2">certainly humans in particular have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:27.380" style="s2">relationship system the influence matrix</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.070" end="00:46:28.550" style="s2">combines attachment theory and what and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.380" end="00:46:30.860" style="s2">what&#39;s called the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.550" end="00:46:33.320" style="s2">circumplex this was actually developed</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.860" end="00:46:35.060" style="s2">mostly by Timothy Leary he was informed</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.320" end="00:46:37.010" style="s2">by some of the psychodynamic work by</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.060" end="00:46:39.290" style="s2">Harry stack Sullivan Timothy Leary</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.010" end="00:46:41.830" style="s2">argued that this is before he went on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.290" end="00:46:43.640" style="s2">his LSD world he was a Harvard professor</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.830" end="00:46:46.010" style="s2">argued that really we could see</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.640" end="00:46:48.590" style="s2">relationships along these two axes</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.010" end="00:46:50.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a vertical axis of competition</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.590" end="00:46:53.240" style="s2">dominance and Submission where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.600" end="00:46:55.160" style="s2">power rank social status dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.240" end="00:46:56.990" style="s2">then there&#39;s a horizontal axis</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.160" end="00:46:59.600" style="s2">associated would be in affiliative and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.990" end="00:47:01.790" style="s2">connected and giving and more or being</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.600" end="00:47:04.130" style="s2">cold and distant and moving away and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.790" end="00:47:06.370" style="s2">this interpersonal circumplex really is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.130" end="00:47:08.270" style="s2">has been a foundation and a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.370" end="00:47:10.460" style="s2">psychology for a long time called</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.270" end="00:47:12.920" style="s2">interpersonal psychology and it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.460" end="00:47:14.630" style="s2">a whole set of organized arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.920" end="00:47:16.910" style="s2">says hey how do we understand human</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.630" end="00:47:19.580" style="s2">behavior through this all right so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.910" end="00:47:21.320" style="s2">the influence matrix basically takes</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.580" end="00:47:24.590" style="s2">behavioral investment theory and then it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.320" end="00:47:26.750" style="s2">places us in a relational context and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.590" end="00:47:28.520" style="s2">then uses attachment theory sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.750" end="00:47:31.070" style="s2">some ways as a foundation and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.520" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">interpersonal circumplex it blends those</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.070" end="00:47:34.190" style="s2">and then says okay now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:36.470" style="s2">framework for understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.190" end="00:47:38.330" style="s2">relationship system okay and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.470" end="00:47:40.130" style="s2">diagram the first thing that you I</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.330" end="00:47:42.560" style="s2">highlight to people is what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.130" end="00:47:44.870" style="s2">black line on the diagram but basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.560" end="00:47:47.810" style="s2">what it suggests is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.870" end="00:47:50.810" style="s2">template that we have for high social</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.810" end="00:47:53.000" style="s2">influence that is hey do what am i able</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.810" end="00:47:54.770" style="s2">to get other people to work for me and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.000" end="00:47:56.090" style="s2">relationship to resources compared to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.770" end="00:47:58.520" style="s2">how I&#39;ve been in the past and how I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.090" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">would and how other people are and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.520" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">what extent am I do I feel known and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:05.180" style="s2">valued by important others so we call</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:09.350" style="s2">this social influence and relational</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.180" end="00:48:11.090" style="s2">value or SAR vsi so your experience of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.350" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">relational value that&#39;s being known and</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.090" end="00:48:15.500" style="s2">valued by important others and to what</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:16.580" style="s2">extent do you have social influence what</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.500" end="00:48:17.860" style="s2">the argument is is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.580" end="00:48:20.170" style="s2">intuitive temp</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.860" end="00:48:21.730" style="s2">for when we have high relational value</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.170" end="00:48:24.340" style="s2">and social influence and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.730" end="00:48:26.470" style="s2">constantly regulating and guiding our</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.340" end="00:48:28.180" style="s2">behavior toward that so that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.470" end="00:48:30.070" style="s2">the things we try to approach and when</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.180" end="00:48:32.530" style="s2">we achieve it we get positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.070" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">you know so when we we set up a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.530" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">and I get to say hey I&#39;m gonna be on Jim</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.150" end="00:48:37.840" style="s2">Rupp&#39;s podcast how&#39;s that for social</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:41.140" style="s2">influence and relational value that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.840" end="00:48:43.690" style="s2">great right or if we get rejected we get</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.140" end="00:48:45.010" style="s2">ignored nobody pays attention to us and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.690" end="00:48:47.260" style="s2">we see this of course when kids are</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.010" end="00:48:49.150" style="s2">three four or five years old they have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.260" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">real sense about what their status is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.150" end="00:48:53.860" style="s2">whether they&#39;re cared for and to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:56.470" style="s2">rejected to be ignored to be criticized</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.860" end="00:48:57.940" style="s2">to put down all of these are signals of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.470" end="00:49:00.040" style="s2">low relational values low social</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.940" end="00:49:01.780" style="s2">influence and they&#39;re very aversive and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.040" end="00:49:03.940" style="s2">what the influence matrix says is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.780" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">we&#39;re tracking our dimensions of power</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.940" end="00:49:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that vertical dimension our</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:10.180" style="s2">dimensions of love that&#39;s the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.110" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">dimension from the circumflex it also</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.180" end="00:49:14.200" style="s2">adds an autonomy and freedom dimension</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.520" end="00:49:16.570" style="s2">which actually other people have noted</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.200" end="00:49:18.100" style="s2">like Pincus and others but anyway and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.570" end="00:49:20.530" style="s2">says hey what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.100" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">we&#39;re engaged in relational processes of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.530" end="00:49:25.120" style="s2">power love and freedom around this need</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">for social influence and relational</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.120" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">value and the influence matrix maps that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">it also shows how some of the real</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:35.320" style="s2">powerful emotions that we have like</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:37.600" style="s2">shame and guilt and hate and pride can</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.320" end="00:49:40.270" style="s2">all be understood and relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.600" end="00:49:42.250" style="s2">changes in our self other dynamics so</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.270" end="00:49:45.580" style="s2">for example if we achieve a higher rank</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.250" end="00:49:48.010" style="s2">we feel pride if we get defeated and are</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:49.750" style="s2">forced into an involuntary submissive</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.010" end="00:49:52.180" style="s2">stance we then often feel weak and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.750" end="00:49:53.380" style="s2">shameful or humiliated so it provides a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.180" end="00:49:55.780" style="s2">framework for understanding social</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.380" end="00:49:58.690" style="s2">emotions which again are energized</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.780" end="00:50:00.370" style="s2">motivational responses out of the goals</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.690" end="00:50:02.290" style="s2">that we have and this emphasizes the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.370" end="00:50:03.970" style="s2">fundamental goal state in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.290" end="00:50:05.950" style="s2">relational goal State in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.970" end="00:50:08.470" style="s2">need for relational value and social</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.950" end="00:50:10.600" style="s2">influence mmm that&#39;s really good now</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.470" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it&#39;s more clear to me now</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.600" end="00:50:14.290" style="s2">that you described it than when I read</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.390" style="s2">it so I&#39;m gonna run a really stupid</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.290" end="00:50:20.520" style="s2">analogy by you and tell me if I hit it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.390" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">one could say that for humans the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.520" end="00:50:27.580" style="s2">interactive social and higher value</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:30.310" style="s2">realm is not that different than eating</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.580" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">grass and getting shot by me is for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.310" end="00:50:34.749" style="s2">groundhog</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">in the case of the poor Schmo out in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.749" end="00:50:40.749" style="s2">world doing his job the man with the gun</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.519" style="s2">is the asshole boss yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.749" end="00:50:44.920" style="s2">so so if you understand our</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.519" end="00:50:47.410" style="s2">hunter-gatherer past Jim we lived in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.920" end="00:50:49.059" style="s2">these very very tight-knit groups okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.410" end="00:50:50.499" style="s2">where we were highly under dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.059" end="00:50:53.019" style="s2">one another they emphasize both</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.499" end="00:50:54.789" style="s2">affiliation and autonomy and your place</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.019" end="00:50:57.130" style="s2">in the group was central especially in</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.789" end="00:50:58.839" style="s2">terms of famine or difficulty and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.130" end="00:51:01.239" style="s2">always the case that you&#39;re you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.839" end="00:51:03.160" style="s2">higher social influences be associated</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.239" end="00:51:05.529" style="s2">more survival more reproductive success</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.160" end="00:51:07.239" style="s2">more success of your offspring so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.529" end="00:51:09.009" style="s2">fundamentally related to our core</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.239" end="00:51:10.809" style="s2">biological needs that&#39;s why nature built</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.009" end="00:51:11.739" style="s2">it in to us and then we carry this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.809" end="00:51:14.019" style="s2">around with us</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.739" end="00:51:15.670" style="s2">you know kids intuitively learn they</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.019" end="00:51:18.130" style="s2">want the highest status position or</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.309" end="00:51:40.329" style="s2">really there novel signals that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.739" end="00:51:42.489" style="s2">really corresponding to what our genuine</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.259" end="00:52:12.849" style="s2">perceive the world and our selves in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.329" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">relationship to others in it that makes</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.849" end="00:52:16.719" style="s2">a lot of sense actually how light is</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:18.969" style="s2">coming on for me this would be very</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.719" end="00:52:21.400" style="s2">helpful for my own work in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.969" end="00:52:23.559" style="s2">about alternative social operating</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.400" end="00:52:25.749" style="s2">systems we may talk about that later</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.559" end="00:52:28.210" style="s2">offline right well it actually just has</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.749" end="00:52:30.549" style="s2">lots of implications for game be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.210" end="00:52:32.890" style="s2">that was the a was a high in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.549" end="00:52:34.509" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about it why not people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.890" end="00:52:36.670" style="s2">interested in game B it&#39;s a hypothesized</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.509" end="00:52:39.700" style="s2">alternative social operating system that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.670" end="00:52:41.799" style="s2">emphasizes human wellbeing over time and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.700" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">long-term survival of humanity in the</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:47.540" style="s2">and you know one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.470" end="00:52:49.700" style="s2">becoming clear as we explore what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.540" end="00:52:51.650" style="s2">game being it&#39;s not yet clear what it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.700" end="00:52:54.860" style="s2">we&#39;re still exploring it is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.650" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">navigating in these human value spaces</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.860" end="00:52:59.720" style="s2">is really important</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">and in particular I kind of lept to one</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.720" end="00:53:04.130" style="s2">particular point which now your theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:06.920" style="s2">may allow me to pull back into a more</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.130" end="00:53:08.990" style="s2">systematic explanation which is when I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.920" end="00:53:12.290" style="s2">look at our game a the way we live today</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.990" end="00:53:15.590" style="s2">one of the cores of its rottenness that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.290" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">and that drives it continuously is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.590" end="00:53:21.620" style="s2">status is determined by possessions and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.940" end="00:53:24.770" style="s2">so that puts people on this strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.620" end="00:53:26.330" style="s2">treadmill of having to work harder and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.770" end="00:53:29.330" style="s2">harder get deeper in debt</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.330" end="00:53:31.460" style="s2">put both parents to work so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.330" end="00:53:33.950" style="s2">social capital creation and the family</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.460" end="00:53:36.080" style="s2">etc just so they can move up from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.950" end="00:53:38.540" style="s2">toyota to a lexus which was basically a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.080" end="00:53:40.940" style="s2">same goddamn thing but with fancier trim</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.540" end="00:53:42.830" style="s2">and some leather on the seats right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:44.750" style="s2">that is just bizarre to me and you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.830" end="00:53:47.930" style="s2">a huge amount of the badness of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.750" end="00:53:49.640" style="s2">society flows from that and your theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.930" end="00:53:51.890" style="s2">with a little leap I had little small</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:54.260" style="s2">leap I had was that oh yeah wait a</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.890" end="00:53:57.470" style="s2">minute this is really just the human</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.260" end="00:53:59.870" style="s2">extension of all the things mr.</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.470" end="00:54:01.700" style="s2">groundhog or mr. white-tailed deer which</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.870" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">is actually the model animal I use for</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.700" end="00:54:06.950" style="s2">most of my actual cognitive science AI</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:09.320" style="s2">work that is our environment that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.950" end="00:54:11.930" style="s2">woods and water and Hunter and salt</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.320" end="00:54:14.150" style="s2">block right yeah and I suppose I should</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.930" end="00:54:16.250" style="s2">have known that but this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.150" end="00:54:16.910" style="s2">kind of connected the two hmm cool so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.250" end="00:54:20.120" style="s2">thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.910" end="00:54:22.190" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m happy to do so and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.120" end="00:54:25.190" style="s2">let&#39;s think about so the issue is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.190" end="00:54:27.320" style="s2">we get here is young u2 of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.190" end="00:54:29.150" style="s2">and I and what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.320" end="00:54:30.350" style="s2">basically okay people gonna drive build</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.150" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">capital capital isn&#39;t done an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.350" end="00:54:34.940" style="s2">unbelievable number of good things in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.300" end="00:54:37.010" style="s2">opinion but it also you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.940" end="00:54:38.750" style="s2">created this machine wherever is seeking</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.010" end="00:54:41.330" style="s2">more and more capital and then more and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:43.010" style="s2">more consumerism all right and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.330" end="00:54:44.690" style="s2">the Enlightenment also built on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.010" end="00:54:47.360" style="s2">massively individualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.690" end="00:54:48.800" style="s2">self-interested model which is valid at</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.360" end="00:54:50.300" style="s2">some level but if you take the influence</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.800" end="00:54:51.290" style="s2">matrix seriously you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.300" end="00:54:52.730" style="s2">actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.290" end="00:54:54.640" style="s2">Aristotle gets it right we&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.730" end="00:54:56.440" style="s2">unbelievably social animal</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.640" end="00:54:59.740" style="s2">we are unbelievably defined by our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.440" end="00:55:01.090" style="s2">relational systems and our place and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.740" end="00:55:02.500" style="s2">what I argue is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.090" end="00:55:05.320" style="s2">modernist thing what it did was it</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.500" end="00:55:07.660" style="s2">emphasized the blueline individualism of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.320" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">rank and achievement and it connected it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.660" end="00:55:11.710" style="s2">to consumerism just as you said and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:12.790" style="s2">that value system that we&#39;re feeding</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.710" end="00:55:15.700" style="s2">people off network</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.790" end="00:55:17.500" style="s2">we&#39;re basically prepared to seek those</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.700" end="00:55:18.580" style="s2">because of them influence matrix but</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.500" end="00:55:20.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the case we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.580" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">prepared if we cultivated it right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.920" end="00:55:24.550" style="s2">this is why I do believe game B if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:26.890" style="s2">done right from a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.550" end="00:55:30.280" style="s2">standpoint an educational developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.890" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">standpoint we can develop the care the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.280" end="00:55:35.770" style="s2">universal care element and we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:37.390" style="s2">emphasize with the relational value you</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.770" end="00:55:38.950" style="s2">mentioned the word social capital in</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.390" end="00:55:40.870" style="s2">fact this is what I call it if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.950" end="00:55:43.090" style="s2">understood that what we actually really</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.870" end="00:55:45.100" style="s2">seek is to be known and valued by</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.090" end="00:55:47.230" style="s2">important others and realize that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.100" end="00:55:49.000" style="s2">is the ultimate status and if we do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.230" end="00:55:50.770" style="s2">with integrity man we can create</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.000" end="00:55:52.900" style="s2">different kinds of social systems we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.770" end="00:55:55.750" style="s2">pointing the power of the capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.900" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">engine at consumerism and the rank the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.750" end="00:56:00.670" style="s2">blue line the climbing if we point it</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:02.680" style="s2">actually at social capital defined in</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.670" end="00:56:04.420" style="s2">terms of mutual relational value and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.680" end="00:56:07.000" style="s2">really that&#39;s actually where we should</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.420" end="00:56:08.620" style="s2">grant status in other words hey are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.000" end="00:56:10.990" style="s2">committed to the communal good are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.620" end="00:56:12.670" style="s2">doing so in a way that is creative and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.990" end="00:56:14.410" style="s2">true to yourself if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.670" end="00:56:16.540" style="s2">hunter-gatherers what they actually did</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.410" end="00:56:19.390" style="s2">so the hunter-gatherers there are anti</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.540" end="00:56:22.570" style="s2">dominant systems all right 100 gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.390" end="00:56:24.580" style="s2">is a really really keen on regulating</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.570" end="00:56:25.810" style="s2">that blue line and we humans have it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.580" end="00:56:27.310" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s so many anti</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.810" end="00:56:30.190" style="s2">dominance what they emphasize is</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.310" end="00:56:32.050" style="s2">autonomy and Communion and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.190" end="00:56:34.270" style="s2">did the capitalists trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.050" end="00:56:36.370" style="s2">basically the reverse we basically said</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.270" end="00:56:38.020" style="s2">here&#39;s your materialistic capital run</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.370" end="00:56:39.940" style="s2">out and get it compare yourself to your</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.020" end="00:56:41.710" style="s2">neighbors and the more you have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.940" end="00:56:43.540" style="s2">higher up the rank you have it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.710" end="00:56:46.270" style="s2">so we inverted the hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.540" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">strategy and certainly did have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.270" end="00:56:49.990" style="s2">good but as you and so many other people</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:51.880" style="s2">that understand the game be system man</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.990" end="00:56:53.590" style="s2">that train is heading for a wall or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.880" end="00:56:55.510" style="s2">cliff and if we don&#39;t turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.590" end="00:56:57.640" style="s2">it&#39;s just gonna chew everything up and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.510" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">then we&#39;ll fall right off and and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.640" end="00:57:01.690" style="s2">know collapse it whatever level of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:04.090" style="s2">disaster that would be hold yep indeed</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.690" end="00:57:06.250" style="s2">in fact essentially you touch on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.090" end="00:57:08.670" style="s2">hunter-gatherers one of my favorite bits</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.250" end="00:57:11.640" style="s2">of anthropology&#39;s by crisp</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.670" end="00:57:12.990" style="s2">a book called hierarchy in the forest it</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.640" end="00:57:15.150" style="s2">really should have been called anti</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.990" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">hierarchy in the forest because what it</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.150" end="00:57:20.610" style="s2">really talks about is how forager level</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:22.890" style="s2">Homo sapiens were able to defeat their</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.610" end="00:57:24.870" style="s2">probable Genetic Programming he went</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.890" end="00:57:26.580" style="s2">back a lot of care and made some</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.870" end="00:57:28.710" style="s2">estimates on you know what came from</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.580" end="00:57:30.870" style="s2">chimps what came from bonobos and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.710" end="00:57:32.700" style="s2">level of dominance hierarchies both have</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.870" end="00:57:35.430" style="s2">and even bonobos usually thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.700" end="00:57:38.550" style="s2">the good guys of our ancestors were way</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.430" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">more dominance hierarchy oriented than</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.550" end="00:57:44.040" style="s2">foragers were and our so our forager</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:46.350" style="s2">hunter-gatherer people developed a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.040" end="00:57:48.390" style="s2">social operating system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.350" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">actually one of the surprisingly one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.390" end="00:57:53.100" style="s2">the antecedents to our game be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:56.460" style="s2">we&#39;re attempts for strongmen to bully</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.100" end="00:57:59.250" style="s2">the other folks were defeated by a whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.460" end="00:57:59.940" style="s2">series of social agreements yeah and</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.830" end="00:58:30.570" style="s2">but then once we invalid developed</p>

<p begin="00:58:30.570" end="00:58:35.700" style="s2">fell into a trap of institution and</p>

<p begin="00:58:53.550" end="00:58:57.030" style="s2">you know about human nature so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.470" end="00:58:58.380" style="s2">that&#39;s quite a little sidebar there but</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.030" end="00:59:00.300" style="s2">you know people are interested in game B</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.380" end="00:59:02.580" style="s2">I should check it out at the game B</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.300" end="00:59:04.680" style="s2">group on Facebook and there&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.580" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">fifteen other associated groups on</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.680" end="00:59:09.510" style="s2">things like game B parenting upgrading</p>

<p begin="00:59:09.510" end="00:59:15.210" style="s2">etc yeah I&#39;m hopeful for game be part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.390" end="00:59:16.500" style="s2">the hope is that actually if we if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.210" end="00:59:17.970" style="s2">really want to hack the human</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.500" end="00:59:20.130" style="s2">psychological system it&#39;s good to have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.970" end="00:59:23.130" style="s2">theory about how it works</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.130" end="00:59:25.770" style="s2">so in fact I&#39;m going to promote this in</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.130" end="00:59:27.330" style="s2">game B I&#39;m going to promote this episode</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.770" end="00:59:28.680" style="s2">in the game B group and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.330" end="00:59:30.450" style="s2">encourage people to take a look into it</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.680" end="00:59:31.980" style="s2">and see if people can find more touch</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.450" end="00:59:33.180" style="s2">points than my one little one that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.980" end="00:59:34.950" style="s2">just found that I&#39;m going to do some</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.180" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">thing about it too but anyway let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.950" end="00:59:38.910" style="s2">back to you this this episode is really</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:41.340" style="s2">about your theory I was gonna hop over</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.910" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">to justification hypothesis which is to</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.340" end="00:59:44.940" style="s2">my mind one of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:46.620" style="s2">parts here of the theory but but before</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.940" end="00:59:48.120" style="s2">we do that I know you&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.620" end="00:59:49.550" style="s2">tugging to do that a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.120" end="00:59:51.810" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.550" end="00:59:53.340" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a full chapter of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.810" end="00:59:54.600" style="s2">late in the book but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.340" end="00:59:56.340" style="s2">little introduction to it in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.600" end="00:59:59.130" style="s2">beginning so why don&#39;t we kind of match</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.340" end="01:00:01.950" style="s2">those two things together and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.130" end="01:00:03.780" style="s2">the tree of knowledge system before we</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.950" end="01:00:07.050" style="s2">jump back and talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.780" end="01:00:08.370" style="s2">justification hypothesis yeah well this</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.050" end="01:00:10.950" style="s2">is great and I appreciate this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.370" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">this is really helpful in terms of if</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.950" end="01:00:14.040" style="s2">you really want to understand the theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.530" style="s2">it is the juxtaposition of these two</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.040" end="01:00:18.300" style="s2">ideas we&#39;ve laid the groundwork for it</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.530" end="01:00:20.220" style="s2">but a lot of the groundwork that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.300" end="01:00:22.920" style="s2">been dialoguing really about is actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.220" end="01:00:24.870" style="s2">after the fact that these chooses ideas</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.920" end="01:00:28.080" style="s2">emerge in fact the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.870" end="01:00:29.700" style="s2">popped out of my head in 1997 in a night</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.080" end="01:00:31.950" style="s2">and you know under just a moment of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.700" end="01:00:33.300" style="s2">insight what is it if you look at it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.950" end="01:00:36.900" style="s2">you&#39;ll see it&#39;s basically four</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.300" end="01:00:39.360" style="s2">upside-down cones identified on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.900" end="01:00:42.300" style="s2">dimension of time that starts with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.360" end="01:00:45.000" style="s2">beginning the Big Bang the cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.300" end="01:00:46.740" style="s2">singularity or whatever primordial atom</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.000" end="01:00:49.310" style="s2">is you want to call it in terms of and</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.740" end="01:00:51.600" style="s2">out of that I call that the pure energy</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.310" end="01:00:53.790" style="s2">singularity and we can get into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.600" end="01:00:55.410" style="s2">metaphysics of that physical claim but</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.790" end="01:00:57.300" style="s2">anyway we&#39;ll say that and then out of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.410" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">that whatever at the level of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.300" end="01:01:01.770" style="s2">inflationary Big Bang moment that then</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.760" end="01:01:03.930" style="s2">Trent started a chain reaction in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.770" end="01:01:06.210" style="s2">energy singularity so that energy began</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.930" end="01:01:08.430" style="s2">to freeze into chunks of matter and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.210" end="01:01:09.960" style="s2">get the explosion of what we&#39;ve mapped</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.430" end="01:01:12.960" style="s2">in the standard model of elementary</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.960" end="01:01:15.930" style="s2">particle physics in terms of quarks and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.960" end="01:01:17.610" style="s2">leptons and for fermions as those and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.930" end="01:01:19.980" style="s2">then you know photons and all and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.610" end="01:01:21.210" style="s2">that but essentially what you get then</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.980" end="01:01:23.550" style="s2">is the emergence of what I call the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.210" end="01:01:25.950" style="s2">matter or material dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.550" end="01:01:28.290" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s our three dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.950" end="01:01:30.210" style="s2">of space in our normal size of course</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.290" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">obviously quantum and mechanics and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.210" end="01:01:34.460" style="s2">general relativity</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:37.190" style="s2">turn out to make that more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.460" end="01:01:39.770" style="s2">at least in non-euclidean sense and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.190" end="01:01:43.360" style="s2">in on time and then you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.770" end="01:01:45.770" style="s2">evolution then of material complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.360" end="01:01:49.160" style="s2">emergence of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.770" end="01:01:51.560" style="s2">properties that happen through time and</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.160" end="01:01:54.380" style="s2">arranger so we get stars we get galaxies</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.560" end="01:01:55.970" style="s2">we get different chemicals then as stars</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.380" end="01:01:58.250" style="s2">produce more and more different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.970" end="01:02:00.620" style="s2">atoms we then get the periodic table of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.250" end="01:02:02.750" style="s2">the elements and lo and behold on our</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.620" end="01:02:05.060" style="s2">little branch of the Milky Way on a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.750" end="01:02:06.860" style="s2">medium-sized planet on a medium-sized</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.060" end="01:02:09.890" style="s2">star and one of the little arms in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.860" end="01:02:13.820" style="s2">Milky Way we get the emergence of life</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.890" end="01:02:15.410" style="s2">that happens approximately 3.8 7 billion</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.820" end="01:02:17.450" style="s2">years ago and the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.410" end="01:02:19.700" style="s2">shows sort of the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.450" end="01:02:22.370" style="s2">material universe up to say four billion</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.700" end="01:02:25.070" style="s2">years ago and then over the last from</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.370" end="01:02:27.890" style="s2">four billion to 700 million years we see</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.070" end="01:02:30.860" style="s2">the evolution of life now what gave rise</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.890" end="01:02:34.220" style="s2">to the actual spark of life I like lanes</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.860" end="01:02:35.030" style="s2">alkaline vent hypothesis but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.220" end="01:02:36.920" style="s2">real mystery</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.030" end="01:02:38.870" style="s2">you get lipids you get a membrane the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.920" end="01:02:40.670" style="s2">inside outside but exactly how you get a</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.870" end="01:02:43.580" style="s2">coding system and and how that actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.670" end="01:02:44.750" style="s2">creates an RNA protein system all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.580" end="01:02:46.760" style="s2">of good questions we could dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.750" end="01:02:48.740" style="s2">about that but really the argument is</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.760" end="01:02:51.350" style="s2">that life really represents a strong</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.740" end="01:02:54.620" style="s2">emergence what do I mean by strong</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.350" end="01:02:56.810" style="s2">emerges I mean that if we go back and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.620" end="01:02:59.110" style="s2">think about how we understand things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.810" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">actually you know from a justification</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.110" end="01:03:02.840" style="s2">hypothesis the idea is that we humans</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:04.490" style="s2">they build these systems of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.840" end="01:03:06.530" style="s2">justification and a lot of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.490" end="01:03:09.170" style="s2">understanding then is defined in against</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.530" end="01:03:11.270" style="s2">other systems so actually modern science</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.170" end="01:03:12.980" style="s2">is understanding of matter is many ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.270" end="01:03:14.840" style="s2">to find against Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.980" end="01:03:17.000" style="s2">understanding and I would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.840" end="01:03:19.210" style="s2">what what Galileo and then Newton did</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.000" end="01:03:21.800" style="s2">was really took Aristotle&#39;s metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.210" end="01:03:23.540" style="s2">and tried to make it as empirical as</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.800" end="01:03:26.420" style="s2">possible and they basically took</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.540" end="01:03:28.220" style="s2">substance and kinetic calls and argued</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.420" end="01:03:30.500" style="s2">hey here&#39;s your material dimension and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.220" end="01:03:32.390" style="s2">you don&#39;t need formal or final causation</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.500" end="01:03:34.130" style="s2">you just look at matter in motion and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.390" end="01:03:36.110" style="s2">you can describe it you can experiment</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.130" end="01:03:38.360" style="s2">on that and actually I do believe that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.110" end="01:03:41.270" style="s2">that forms a pretty good articulation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.360" end="01:03:43.220" style="s2">how matter actually behaves but what</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.270" end="01:03:44.300" style="s2">Galileo or others really haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.220" end="01:03:47.300" style="s2">realized is we act</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.300" end="01:03:49.490" style="s2">we need formal and final causation to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.300" end="01:03:51.470" style="s2">understand the way cells behave in fact</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.340" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">and kinetic causation descriptively and</p>

<p begin="01:04:44.300" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">existence so you get the biological</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.490" end="01:05:03.470" style="s2">depicts the emergence of that dimension</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.250" end="01:05:07.160" style="s2">of complexity and then what it does is</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.470" end="01:05:09.050" style="s2">says hey 700 million years ago we had</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.160" end="01:05:11.180" style="s2">seen now the emergence of cellular life</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.050" end="01:05:13.070" style="s2">and plant life and then somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.180" end="01:05:14.780" style="s2">between 700 million years and over the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.070" end="01:05:16.820" style="s2">last time spans to say up to five</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.780" end="01:05:18.770" style="s2">million years ago we see the explosion</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.820" end="01:05:21.950" style="s2">and the emergence of the evolution mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.770" end="01:05:24.170" style="s2">what I call mind which is really the set</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.950" end="01:05:25.910" style="s2">of mental behavior which we can observe</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.170" end="01:05:28.220" style="s2">through the way animals engage in</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.220" end="01:05:30.890" style="s2">nervous system and of course we talked</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.570" end="01:05:33.230" style="s2">about behavioral investment theory so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.890" end="01:05:35.300" style="s2">you see the emergence of the animal</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.230" end="01:05:37.460" style="s2">kingdom and then over the last hundred</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.300" end="01:05:39.560" style="s2">thousand years of psycho we see the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.460" end="01:05:42.430" style="s2">emergence of the fourth dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.560" end="01:05:45.140" style="s2">complexity culture and that is how</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.360" end="01:05:51.650" style="s2">but really give rise to the way in which</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.310" end="01:05:53.810" style="s2">humans build what I call inter</p>

<p begin="01:05:55.660" end="01:05:58.930" style="s2">how we build those knowledge systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.369" end="01:06:00.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the person culture plane of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.930" end="01:06:02.650" style="s2">existence and the tree of knowledge also</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.970" end="01:06:05.170" style="s2">said then trails that system of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.650" end="01:06:07.869" style="s2">justification and argues that over the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.170" end="01:06:09.670" style="s2">last 400 years a really unique system of</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.869" end="01:06:12.220" style="s2">justification has emerged which we call</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.670" end="01:06:14.080" style="s2">science science not only had a</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.220" end="01:06:16.060" style="s2">philosophy but it has an empirical</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.080" end="01:06:18.130" style="s2">method in a particular way then of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.060" end="01:06:20.619" style="s2">mapping the emergence of evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.130" end="01:06:22.780" style="s2">complexity and out of culture emerges</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.619" end="01:06:24.730" style="s2">science and scientific knowledge to then</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.780" end="01:06:28.210" style="s2">proceed to give us an ontological</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.730" end="01:06:30.340" style="s2">epistemological map of the Antec reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.210" end="01:06:31.869" style="s2">so that then you see science emerging</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.340" end="01:06:34.690" style="s2">out of culture and the few get the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.869" end="01:06:35.890" style="s2">physical sciences mapping matter the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.690" end="01:06:38.680" style="s2">material dimension you get the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.890" end="01:06:39.700" style="s2">biological sciences mapping life you get</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.680" end="01:06:42.220" style="s2">what I want to call the basic</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.700" end="01:06:45.160" style="s2">psychological sciences or just call them</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.220" end="01:06:46.900" style="s2">the mind and brain behavior sciences if</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.160" end="01:06:49.090" style="s2">you&#39;d want the mapping the dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.900" end="01:06:51.010" style="s2">animal behavior what I call mind and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.090" end="01:06:52.780" style="s2">get the Social Sciences then mapping the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.010" end="01:06:54.310" style="s2">emergence of the person culture</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.780" end="01:06:57.070" style="s2">dimension and so the Tree of Knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.310" end="01:06:59.859" style="s2">then gives us a picture of reality on</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.070" end="01:07:01.540" style="s2">the one hand in a new view light in</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.859" end="01:07:03.609" style="s2">terms of these different frequencies of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.540" end="01:07:05.260" style="s2">behavioral complexity and then it also</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.609" end="01:07:07.270" style="s2">tells us these are the dimensions of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.260" end="01:07:09.250" style="s2">science and one other thing I want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.270" end="01:07:11.290" style="s2">connect to because this is your you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.250" end="01:07:13.300" style="s2">they&#39;re complex adaptive systems people</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.290" end="01:07:14.890" style="s2">are unbelievable emotion to me in</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.300" end="01:07:15.880" style="s2">thinking about the way that works but</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.890" end="01:07:17.980" style="s2">one of the things the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.880" end="01:07:19.660" style="s2">says is these different landscapes</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.980" end="01:07:21.910" style="s2">emerge as a function of different</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.660" end="01:07:24.310" style="s2">information processing systems and</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.910" end="01:07:27.100" style="s2">communication between complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.310" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">agents so you get cell communicating</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.100" end="01:07:31.990" style="s2">with each other as genes store and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.250" style="s2">process information across time and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.990" end="01:07:35.260" style="s2">you get nervous systems which are</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.250" end="01:07:36.700" style="s2">processing information and animals</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.260" end="01:07:38.740" style="s2">communicating with each other that gives</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.700" end="01:07:41.770" style="s2">that mind dimension then you get</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.740" end="01:07:43.480" style="s2">linguistic cognition and of course human</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.770" end="01:07:45.100" style="s2">language where humans are Camille</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.480" end="01:07:47.650" style="s2">coordinating with each other so each</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.100" end="01:07:49.990" style="s2">system each dimension has given rise to</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.650" end="01:07:52.210" style="s2">as a function of information processing</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.990" end="01:07:54.520" style="s2">and communication systems of the genetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.210" end="01:07:55.930" style="s2">neuronal and linguistic level and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.520" end="01:07:58.030" style="s2">is what gives rise to these different</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.930" end="01:08:00.100" style="s2">dimensions and that that&#39;s the Tree of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.030" end="01:08:02.140" style="s2">Knowledge most obvious feature when you</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.100" end="01:08:05.000" style="s2">look at it these four upside-down cones</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.140" end="01:08:08.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s a corner</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.000" end="01:08:10.370" style="s2">the Purple&#39;s yeah very good it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.540" end="01:08:12.380" style="s2">interesting theory it corresponds</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.370" end="01:08:14.180" style="s2">relatively well to how I might cut it of</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.380" end="01:08:16.160" style="s2">course there are many levels of</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.180" end="01:08:18.440" style="s2">emergence my good friend</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.160" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">rest in peace Harold Moritz wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.440" end="01:08:20.779" style="s2">great book on emergence I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:23.060" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.779" end="01:08:25.670" style="s2">emergence and he laid out twenty seven</p>

<p begin="01:08:25.670" end="01:08:31.130" style="s2">let&#39;s say advanced economics or somesuch</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.580" end="01:08:33.680" style="s2">and of course you can cut it lots of</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.130" end="01:08:35.240" style="s2">different ways into lots more than 27</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.680" end="01:08:37.730" style="s2">though probably not too many less than</p>

<p begin="01:08:40.490" end="01:08:45.859" style="s2">said there&#39;s a bright line between</p>

<p begin="01:08:45.859" end="01:08:50.359" style="s2">and I suppose I have not been so clear</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.589" end="01:08:52.759" style="s2">about between mind and culture but that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.359" end="01:08:54.950" style="s2">makes good sense too so as long as we</p>

<p begin="01:08:54.950" end="01:08:58.609" style="s2">of the emergent stack but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.779" end="01:09:01.160" style="s2">one that&#39;s particularly useful for</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.609" end="01:09:03.200" style="s2">developing theory well with that very</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.160" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">good description of the of the Tree of</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:09.589" style="s2">fairly purely human aspect and you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.330" end="01:09:13.220" style="s2">talk about how it happened to be that</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.589" end="01:09:15.830" style="s2">this would be emergent in humans but not</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.220" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">in other levels your theory of the</p>

<p begin="01:09:21.620" end="01:09:25.730" style="s2">actually the picture model is the tree</p>

<p begin="01:09:28.430" end="01:09:33.190" style="s2">I say 300 I stood about tree of</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.190" end="01:09:38.060" style="s2">right and it is an allusion to the tree</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.170" end="01:09:40.759" style="s2">of knowledge in Genesis and I could</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.060" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">explain why I am trying to connect our</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.460" end="01:09:51.890" style="s2">let me talk about the justification</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.759" end="01:09:53.750" style="s2">hypothesis and what I now what my friend</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.890" end="01:09:54.290" style="s2">Jo Mikulski convinced me I should really</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.750" end="01:09:56.870" style="s2">have called</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.290" end="01:09:59.900" style="s2">justified systems theory which is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.870" end="01:10:02.570" style="s2">broader idea so it&#39;s a multi-layered</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.900" end="01:10:04.760" style="s2">ideas a lot of mine tend to be but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.570" end="01:10:07.010" style="s2">going to start with the justification</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.760" end="01:10:09.500" style="s2">hypothesis what is that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.010" end="01:10:12.650" style="s2">justification hypothesis is the an idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.500" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">that connects the evolution of language</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.650" end="01:10:20.210" style="s2">to our human ego our self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:22.310" style="s2">what I call the ego or the mental organ</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.210" end="01:10:25.040" style="s2">of justification which if you use the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.310" end="01:10:27.619" style="s2">model so the idea is is if you know of</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.040" end="01:10:30.139" style="s2">we go straight to say neuropsychological</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.619" end="01:10:31.940" style="s2">research with Michael Gazzaniga and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.139" end="01:10:34.100" style="s2">others we know that the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.940" end="01:10:37.300" style="s2">at least in most people really can be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.100" end="01:10:39.350" style="s2">thought of as an interpretive system and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.300" end="01:10:41.900" style="s2">fascinating research on split brain</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.350" end="01:10:43.730" style="s2">individuals has shown that that left</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.900" end="01:10:46.310" style="s2">hemisphere system left on its own device</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.730" end="01:10:49.429" style="s2">will simply generate socially acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.310" end="01:10:52.699" style="s2">rationales for what&#39;s going on even if</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.429" end="01:10:54.920" style="s2">it has been sort of isolated because the</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.699" end="01:10:56.900" style="s2">corpus callosum getting cut even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.920" end="01:10:59.960" style="s2">been isolated from having access to</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.900" end="01:11:01.940" style="s2">information okay so if we see what</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.960" end="01:11:03.739" style="s2">Gazzaniga called the interpreter</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.940" end="01:11:05.869" style="s2">function which is that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.739" end="01:11:07.639" style="s2">tendency all things being equal when</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.869" end="01:11:09.889" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of on automatic pilot to</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.639" end="01:11:12.230" style="s2">generate socially acceptable rationales</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.889" end="01:11:16.250" style="s2">for our behavior now let&#39;s go back in</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.230" end="01:11:18.440" style="s2">time and let&#39;s start to imagine what</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.250" end="01:11:20.690" style="s2">changes you talked about sort of a real</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.440" end="01:11:23.480" style="s2">speciation maybe event and language</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.690" end="01:11:25.429" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about that okay because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.480" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">believe that human language is a game</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.429" end="01:11:30.260" style="s2">changer so and here&#39;s how I you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:32.239" style="s2">basics phases of evolution of language</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.260" end="01:11:34.969" style="s2">so I think that you&#39;re getting big</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.239" end="01:11:36.619" style="s2">changes in terms of our brain size I</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.969" end="01:11:38.780" style="s2">think you&#39;re getting big changes in</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.619" end="01:11:40.969" style="s2">relationship to our social coordination</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.780" end="01:11:43.340" style="s2">you are seeing tool use the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.969" end="01:11:44.630" style="s2">fire makes a big difference how we hunt</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.340" end="01:11:46.400" style="s2">so there are a lot of social</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.630" end="01:11:48.619" style="s2">coordination changes and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.400" end="01:11:49.929" style="s2">what initially is happening is all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.619" end="01:11:53.630" style="s2">of memetic</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.929" end="01:11:57.159" style="s2">processes and intuition of aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.630" end="01:12:00.380" style="s2">pre verbal inter subjective coordination</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.159" end="01:12:02.630" style="s2">punting and and the gut gesturing and</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.380" end="01:12:05.960" style="s2">what I would get I would say pre</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.630" end="01:12:09.139" style="s2">language systems that are not full but</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.960" end="01:12:11.900" style="s2">partial okay if you read Merlyn Donald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.139" end="01:12:14.300" style="s2">origin of the human mind he has a really</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.900" end="01:12:17.000" style="s2">really the modern mind I think it is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.300" end="01:12:19.400" style="s2">really brilliant articulation what he</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:21.770" style="s2">called mimetics which is basically my</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.400" end="01:12:23.869" style="s2">mean each other and coordinating around</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.770" end="01:12:25.130" style="s2">broken language so here you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.869" end="01:12:27.800" style="s2">situation where you&#39;d say things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.130" end="01:12:29.389" style="s2">antelope there and make a gesture and</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.800" end="01:12:30.539" style="s2">other people would gesture and I have an</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.389" end="01:12:32.639" style="s2">intuitive understanding</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.539" end="01:12:35.399" style="s2">what the intent was and what the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.639" end="01:12:37.559" style="s2">was okay what I argue here is what you</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.399" end="01:12:39.749" style="s2">have going on with the cognitive system</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.559" end="01:12:42.030" style="s2">you have the system being able to really</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.749" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">represent objects like antelope and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.030" end="01:12:45.659" style="s2">their position in space and how they</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:48.359" style="s2">might change that&#39;s gonna give rise to</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.659" end="01:12:50.010" style="s2">things like verbs and adjectives and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.359" end="01:12:52.799" style="s2">start to have a symbolic tagging</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.010" end="01:12:55.229" style="s2">capacity and then there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.799" end="01:12:57.299" style="s2">miracle of grammar that happens and</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.229" end="01:12:59.699" style="s2">whether this is a something that happens</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.299" end="01:13:01.619" style="s2">sort of with a fox 2 gene and happens</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.699" end="01:13:03.539" style="s2">immediately or something that happens</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.619" end="01:13:05.219" style="s2">over a long period of time you know this</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.539" end="01:13:07.739" style="s2">got a very difficult question to answer</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.219" end="01:13:09.659" style="s2">but I do believe that very dramatic</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.739" end="01:13:11.429" style="s2">changes happen although I really find</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.659" end="01:13:13.829" style="s2">animal language and communication</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.429" end="01:13:16.439" style="s2">research interesting I see a gulf a</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.829" end="01:13:17.879" style="s2">major Gulf and most people then say well</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.439" end="01:13:19.829" style="s2">if you get this communication capacity</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.879" end="01:13:21.359" style="s2">you have this higher cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.829" end="01:13:23.729" style="s2">we&#39;re already engaged in some tool</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.359" end="01:13:25.799" style="s2">making now you add language to it we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.729" end="01:13:27.089" style="s2">build these cognitive gadgets through</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.799" end="01:13:29.429" style="s2">language in a way that other animals</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.089" end="01:13:30.569" style="s2">can&#39;t we can feedback and dialogue with</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.429" end="01:13:33.149" style="s2">each other man isn&#39;t that an</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.569" end="01:13:37.109" style="s2">unbelievable advantage and the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.149" end="01:13:40.949" style="s2">me is yes however here&#39;s my big insight</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.109" end="01:13:42.659" style="s2">and that is is that language and we deal</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.949" end="01:13:44.280" style="s2">with this everyday all the time is</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.659" end="01:13:47.039" style="s2">language gives rise to the problem what</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.280" end="01:13:49.799" style="s2">I call the problem of justification okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.039" end="01:13:51.569" style="s2">and that is if I&#39;m gonna once you get</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.799" end="01:13:53.849" style="s2">full language you have a propositional</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.569" end="01:13:57.119" style="s2">statement so now I can say the antelope</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.849" end="01:13:59.969" style="s2">are over there all right when I just say</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.119" end="01:14:02.489" style="s2">antelope and there I can&#39;t engage that</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.969" end="01:14:04.709" style="s2">but now I have a statement which now can</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.489" end="01:14:06.629" style="s2">correspond or not propositional e in</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.709" end="01:14:08.879" style="s2">terms of its meeting to the actual state</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.629" end="01:14:11.609" style="s2">of affairs and this gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.879" end="01:14:14.129" style="s2">question capacity well how the hell do</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.609" end="01:14:15.389" style="s2">you know that okay how do you know that</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.129" end="01:14:17.129" style="s2">that&#39;s over there</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.389" end="01:14:18.569" style="s2">all right and that&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.129" end="01:14:20.549" style="s2">justification where you actually start</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.569" end="01:14:23.609" style="s2">to legitimize and this gives rise to</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.549" end="01:14:24.929" style="s2">reason giving and reason analysis all</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.609" end="01:14:26.489" style="s2">right there&#39;s actually been a recent</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.929" end="01:14:27.989" style="s2">book the Enigma reason who actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.489" end="01:14:30.839" style="s2">seems to draw many of the same ideas</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.989" end="01:14:32.760" style="s2">that I developed by Sperber and Hugo</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.839" end="01:14:35.219" style="s2">Mercier and they try to argue that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.760" end="01:14:37.199" style="s2">actually generating statements and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.219" end="01:14:39.869" style="s2">justifying reasoning and arguing played</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.199" end="01:14:42.809" style="s2">a big role I agree with that and I build</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.869" end="01:14:43.570" style="s2">off of that further so I also articulate</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.809" end="01:14:45.550" style="s2">not only do</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.570" end="01:14:46.960" style="s2">the problem of justification which by</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.550" end="01:14:49.630" style="s2">the way this concept of justification</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.960" end="01:14:51.880" style="s2">becomes a central idea and how we think</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.630" end="01:14:53.680" style="s2">about human knowledge the least</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.880" end="01:14:56.110" style="s2">propositional knowledge in fact I always</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.680" end="01:14:58.360" style="s2">translate propositional knowledge into</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.110" end="01:15:00.790" style="s2">justification because it&#39;s actually much</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.360" end="01:15:02.500" style="s2">more socially relevant you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.790" end="01:15:03.940" style="s2">propositions you know we can debate them</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.500" end="01:15:06.310" style="s2">but what do they actually mean you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.940" end="01:15:08.260" style="s2">into justifications and you say well</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.310" end="01:15:09.670" style="s2">what am i a JIT amaizing about what is</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.260" end="01:15:11.260" style="s2">and what ought to be well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.670" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">actually now you&#39;re engaged in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.260" end="01:15:15.340" style="s2">actual you know is it legitimate to vote</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">for Trump I mean that&#39;s a justification</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.340" end="01:15:19.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the way we live in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:20.800" style="s2">world okay so now you have the language</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.540" end="01:15:22.060" style="s2">you get this emerging problem of</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.800" end="01:15:24.280" style="s2">justification this gives rise to</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.060" end="01:15:26.440" style="s2">question-and-answer dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.280" end="01:15:28.690" style="s2">reasoning and reason giving and then you</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.440" end="01:15:30.600" style="s2">take a little deeper and then you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.690" end="01:15:33.550" style="s2">into what I call the problem of social</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.600" end="01:15:36.100" style="s2">justification now social justification</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.550" end="01:15:39.520" style="s2">is this issue about how the hell do you</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.100" end="01:15:42.990" style="s2">explain your actions to other people in</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.520" end="01:15:45.280" style="s2">a way that manages your social</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.990" end="01:15:46.930" style="s2">influences remember are the influence</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.280" end="01:15:49.300" style="s2">matrix says hey your social influence is</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.930" end="01:15:51.520" style="s2">really important okay right and so now</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.300" end="01:15:52.750" style="s2">so here&#39;s the example I always use it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.520" end="01:15:54.850" style="s2">sort of like okay let&#39;s say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.750" end="01:15:57.250" style="s2">pair-bonded with somebody and I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.850" end="01:15:59.890" style="s2">big and strong all right and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.250" end="01:16:02.020" style="s2">you&#39;re really interested in my mate all</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.890" end="01:16:04.600" style="s2">right and I go off on a hunt and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.020" end="01:16:06.220" style="s2">start hanging around okay and then I</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.600" end="01:16:09.520" style="s2">come back and I notice you&#39;re around I</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.220" end="01:16:11.110" style="s2">say hey Jim what are you doing you the</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.520" end="01:16:12.700" style="s2">last thing you want to say is actually I</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.110" end="01:16:14.470" style="s2">want to separate the two of you and take</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.700" end="01:16:17.680" style="s2">her as my mate but that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.470" end="01:16:19.150" style="s2">inside your knowledge system okay so</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.680" end="01:16:20.530" style="s2">what do you actually say so actually hey</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.150" end="01:16:22.360" style="s2">she&#39;s just cheating me teaching me to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.530" end="01:16:24.760" style="s2">plant seeds you know I&#39;m just hanging</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.360" end="01:16:27.520" style="s2">around here so in other words what this</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.760" end="01:16:29.440" style="s2">says is that actually our core motives</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.520" end="01:16:31.030" style="s2">to the extent that they&#39;re socially</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.440" end="01:16:32.980" style="s2">unacceptable to the extent that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.030" end="01:16:35.560" style="s2">would cost us courage to be Creed</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.980" end="01:16:36.790" style="s2">conflict make us judge other people be</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.560" end="01:16:39.370" style="s2">the kinds of things that would be</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.790" end="01:16:41.260" style="s2">outside of convention to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.370" end="01:16:43.150" style="s2">those things we are actually not going</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.260" end="01:16:45.850" style="s2">to have nearly as good access to that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.150" end="01:16:47.470" style="s2">and our mental organ of justification is</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.850" end="01:16:49.300" style="s2">actually going to be organized so to</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.470" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">have a lot of press secretary Mike</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.300" end="01:16:53.860" style="s2">functions in it so that we legitimize</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:55.810" style="s2">ourselves and give ourselves the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.860" end="01:16:58.120" style="s2">that a doubt when goes bad we</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.810" end="01:16:59.380" style="s2">look for external explanations when</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.120" end="01:17:01.660" style="s2">goes well it&#39;s yeah because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.380" end="01:17:03.490" style="s2">confident when our friends do good stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.660" end="01:17:05.380" style="s2">hey it&#39;s cuz they&#39;re confident when our</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.490" end="01:17:07.510" style="s2">friends do lousy stuff flip it around</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.380" end="01:17:09.670" style="s2">our enemies they&#39;re always to blame for</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.510" end="01:17:12.190" style="s2">anything that bad happens okay so we</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.670" end="01:17:15.070" style="s2">have this natural social justification</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.190" end="01:17:18.040" style="s2">tendency that ties our reason giving to</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.070" end="01:17:20.110" style="s2">social influence dynamics and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.040" end="01:17:22.180" style="s2">generated this hypothesis when I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.110" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">learning about Freudian therapy in</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.180" end="01:17:27.400" style="s2">theory okay and if you put it in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:29.560" style="s2">term you basically get a evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.400" end="01:17:31.690" style="s2">reverse engineering explanation for</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.560" end="01:17:33.850" style="s2">Freud meaning that what for each</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.690" end="01:17:35.260" style="s2">observation what fundamentally did he</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.850" end="01:17:37.570" style="s2">say now straights had a lot of crazy</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.260" end="01:17:39.640" style="s2"> but what he is a brilliant observer</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.570" end="01:17:41.500" style="s2">of human behavior and what he saw is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.640" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">that people had these core bio</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.500" end="01:17:46.240" style="s2">Psychological drives they lived in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.320" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">social environment that told them and</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.240" end="01:17:50.200" style="s2">dictated them what was appropriate of</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:52.420" style="s2">what was not and they operated off of a</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.200" end="01:17:54.490" style="s2">social reality principle that tried to</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.420" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">rationalize what it is that they did as</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.490" end="01:17:58.270" style="s2">they regulated the drives that were</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:18:00.580" style="s2">threatening to the social environment</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.270" end="01:18:02.140" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what Freud observed and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.580" end="01:18:03.970" style="s2">built the whole theory around well this</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.140" end="01:18:06.490" style="s2">says that&#39;s exactly right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.970" end="01:18:08.730" style="s2">actual dilemma of being a self-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.490" end="01:18:11.170" style="s2">being that lives in a culture of</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.730" end="01:18:13.330" style="s2">justification and you have your selfish</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.170" end="01:18:14.830" style="s2">primitive desires and you have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.330" end="01:18:16.720" style="s2">out how to tell a story about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.830" end="01:18:19.120" style="s2">happening in a way that doesn&#39;t cost you</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.720" end="01:18:21.070" style="s2">and so this creates this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.120" end="01:18:23.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a real self conscious design</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.070" end="01:18:26.530" style="s2">feature towards justifying that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.350" end="01:18:28.840" style="s2">justification hypothesis and ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.530" end="01:18:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s part of justification Systems</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.840" end="01:18:32.950" style="s2">Theory I&#39;ll pause there and see if that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.880" end="01:18:34.240" style="s2">makes sense to you but the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.950" end="01:18:36.730" style="s2">is that we have a mental organ of</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.240" end="01:18:39.400" style="s2">justification that evolved in response</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.730" end="01:18:41.350" style="s2">to the problem of social justification</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.400" end="01:18:45.190" style="s2">that comes along with propositional</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.350" end="01:18:47.980" style="s2">language well one could cook it down is</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.190" end="01:18:50.890" style="s2">that we have once we realize that we can</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.980" end="01:18:56.080" style="s2">create false statements we can navigate</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.890" end="01:18:57.850" style="s2">in strategy space by lying right right</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.080" end="01:18:59.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a buzz a movie on the invention</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.850" end="01:19:01.300" style="s2">of lying and this is the this is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.770" end="01:19:03.070" style="s2">affirmative side so I often talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.300" end="01:19:04.510" style="s2">people feeling vulnerable and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.070" end="01:19:05.400" style="s2">defensive and then of course now you</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.510" end="01:19:06.840" style="s2">have the strategic</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.400" end="01:19:08.730" style="s2">side of this equation to which you just</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.840" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">alluded to which you can now engage in</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.730" end="01:19:13.500" style="s2">misinformation disinformation actual</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:16.130" style="s2">line and of course that&#39;s what all part</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.500" end="01:19:19.340" style="s2">of the absolutely the landscape now of</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.130" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">deceit deception whether it&#39;s active or</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.340" end="01:19:23.670" style="s2">subconsciously biased but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:25.770" style="s2">part of the game absolutely yeah lying</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.670" end="01:19:28.199" style="s2">to yourself lying to others to different</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.770" end="01:19:30.330" style="s2">sets right yeah you give the example of</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.199" end="01:19:32.460" style="s2">you know the dude hanging around the</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.330" end="01:19:35.070" style="s2">sweet chick while the bulky husband is</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.460" end="01:19:37.050" style="s2">off hunting and then saying yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.070" end="01:19:38.580" style="s2">just here to learn about her planting of</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.050" end="01:19:42.120" style="s2">seed I wasn&#39;t actually thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.580" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">planting my own seed haha you know is</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.120" end="01:19:46.320" style="s2">that you know is that self-deception or</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:47.790" style="s2">lying or can you not tell the difference</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.320" end="01:19:49.770" style="s2">or doesn&#39;t even matter right I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.790" end="01:19:52.050" style="s2">perhaps on there right at the broadest</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.770" end="01:19:53.940" style="s2">level of justification hypothesis one</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.050" end="01:19:56.640" style="s2">might say well does it really matter</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.940" end="01:19:59.670" style="s2">there are a way to embed in a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.640" end="01:20:01.440" style="s2">matrix that doesn&#39;t upset the matrix too</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.670" end="01:20:03.630" style="s2">much and yet you&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.440" end="01:20:05.520" style="s2">navigating a personal trajectory you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.630" end="01:20:06.989" style="s2">building a personal story I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.520" end="01:20:09.060" style="s2">thinking out loud here so this might be</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.989" end="01:20:11.250" style="s2">ridiculous that&#39;s right you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.060" end="01:20:14.429" style="s2">you&#39;re navigating a personal journey in</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.250" end="01:20:16.710" style="s2">a social context with stakes both low</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.429" end="01:20:19.170" style="s2">and high you have this thing called</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.710" end="01:20:22.710" style="s2">language which you both consciously and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.170" end="01:20:25.380" style="s2">unconsciously know can be misleading or</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.710" end="01:20:28.620" style="s2">outright false and so part of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.380" end="01:20:30.659" style="s2">navigation is using that capability to</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.620" end="01:20:32.790" style="s2">your best advantage absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.659" end="01:20:34.770" style="s2">absolutely and it does say certainly</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.790" end="01:20:36.900" style="s2">that we have that there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.770" end="01:20:38.940" style="s2">domains of mind that we will have much</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.900" end="01:20:41.010" style="s2">more readily access to and there are</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.940" end="01:20:43.710" style="s2">good reasons to actually so the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.010" end="01:20:45.750" style="s2">self-deception my self-consciousness may</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.710" end="01:20:48.270" style="s2">be have ready access to certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.750" end="01:20:51.390" style="s2">domains of knowledge that are embedded</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.270" end="01:20:53.130" style="s2">in my you know more subconscious systems</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.390" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">in ways that I don&#39;t have access to so</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.130" end="01:20:57.330" style="s2">all of that is true absolutely in fact</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:20:58.650" style="s2">actually getting back to our game be</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.330" end="01:21:01.290" style="s2">world one of the things we Porsche is</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.650" end="01:21:03.630" style="s2">called sovereignty which is to be able</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.290" end="01:21:06.780" style="s2">to get a level of view on our own</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.630" end="01:21:08.280" style="s2">psychological machinery so that at least</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.780" end="01:21:10.230" style="s2">with other people that are in</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.280" end="01:21:12.719" style="s2">sovereignty we can all agree to operate</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.230" end="01:21:15.870" style="s2">with honesty and good faith at all times</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.719" end="01:21:19.200" style="s2">and that that&#39;s kind of a hack on some</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.870" end="01:21:21.870" style="s2">of the the misuses of our capability</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.200" end="01:21:24.240" style="s2">of navigating in the justification space</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.870" end="01:21:26.910" style="s2">absolutely hundred percent and what this</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.240" end="01:21:29.430" style="s2">says is in fact I I label in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.910" end="01:21:31.290" style="s2">other parts of the justification of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.430" end="01:21:32.580" style="s2">overall justification system series it</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.290" end="01:21:34.830" style="s2">gives what&#39;s called the updated</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.580" end="01:21:38.400" style="s2">tripartite model of human consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.830" end="01:21:40.500" style="s2">and it identifies the core nonverbal</p>

<p begin="01:21:40.500" end="01:21:44.310" style="s2">consciousness then the self conscious</p>

<p begin="01:22:20.610" end="01:22:23.370" style="s2">that you try to hide him from yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.110" end="01:22:24.810" style="s2">and how do you actually manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.370" end="01:22:25.770" style="s2">people even while you&#39;re trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.810" end="01:22:27.660" style="s2">you&#39;re being helpful</p>

<p begin="01:22:48.120" end="01:22:52.020" style="s2">good point just for my benefit I your</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.010" end="01:22:53.700" style="s2">people talk about shadow and shadow work</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.020" end="01:22:54.900" style="s2">and frankly it sounds like you know just</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.700" end="01:22:56.160" style="s2">I have no idea what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.900" end="01:22:58.020" style="s2">talking about sounds like horseshit</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.160" end="01:23:00.150" style="s2">right it sounds like you actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.020" end="01:23:02.610" style="s2">pretty clear definition of what is</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.150" end="01:23:04.890" style="s2">shadow and what is shadow work just for</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.610" end="01:23:07.860" style="s2">my benefit could you give us a minute or</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.890" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">two on that sure so basically what this</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.860" end="01:23:10.890" style="s2">argues is that you have a self</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:13.410" style="s2">consciousness system that wants to see</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.890" end="01:23:15.330" style="s2">yourself as good wants to see yourself</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.410" end="01:23:18.360" style="s2">as useful wants to see yourself as</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.330" end="01:23:20.400" style="s2">strong that&#39;s it&#39;s a tractor state okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.360" end="01:23:22.320" style="s2">so if you start what if you start acting</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.400" end="01:23:24.660" style="s2">in a particular way so that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.320" end="01:23:27.360" style="s2">classic the classic shadow is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.660" end="01:23:29.190" style="s2">narcissist or one classic there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:30.650" style="s2">of them one would be an individual to go</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.190" end="01:23:32.420" style="s2">around bragging all the time</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.650" end="01:23:34.219" style="s2">hey I did this because I&#39;m super good</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.420" end="01:23:35.780" style="s2">and I did this because I&#39;m super you</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.219" end="01:23:38.330" style="s2">know hey come hang with me</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.780" end="01:23:40.219" style="s2">well what&#39;s underneath that is and this</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.330" end="01:23:42.110" style="s2">is there&#39;s a subtype of narcissus that</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.219" end="01:23:44.090" style="s2">clearly have this dynamic and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.110" end="01:23:45.770" style="s2">underneath that at the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.090" end="01:23:48.590" style="s2">level in other words the subconscious</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.770" end="01:23:50.360" style="s2">experience level is a fear an insecurity</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.590" end="01:23:52.699" style="s2">that there really have low social</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.360" end="01:23:54.679" style="s2">influence low relational value and if</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.699" end="01:23:57.140" style="s2">the other persons knew who they really</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.679" end="01:23:59.210" style="s2">were they would abandon them so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.140" end="01:24:01.400" style="s2">constantly justifying why they deserve</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.210" end="01:24:03.199" style="s2">attention all right well if you get him</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.400" end="01:24:05.150" style="s2">into therapy and what you try to do is</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.199" end="01:24:07.640" style="s2">you shine the light and you realize that</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.150" end="01:24:10.310" style="s2">okay this important person classically</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.640" end="01:24:12.050" style="s2">the father you know ignored me and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.310" end="01:24:13.580" style="s2">felt weak in relationship to this and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.050" end="01:24:16.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve been compensating for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.580" end="01:24:17.510" style="s2">underlying weakness by trying to prove</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.100" end="01:24:19.699" style="s2">to myself and others that I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.510" end="01:24:21.650" style="s2">valuable well underneath all that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.699" end="01:24:23.630" style="s2">that the shitty feeling that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.650" end="01:24:26.510" style="s2">actually a low relational value low</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.630" end="01:24:30.140" style="s2">self-worth person and that&#39;s the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.510" end="01:24:32.060" style="s2">side of the advanced pride that</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.140" end="01:24:33.770" style="s2">everybody sees and really can see a sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.060" end="01:24:37.070" style="s2">of shallow admit and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.770" end="01:24:39.710" style="s2">ineffective in a classic portrayal of</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.070" end="01:24:41.179" style="s2">that so the underlying shame would be</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.710" end="01:24:43.190" style="s2">hidden from this person&#39;s initial</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.179" end="01:24:44.929" style="s2">consciousness and then in the therapy</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.190" end="01:24:47.420" style="s2">room what you do in fact there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.929" end="01:24:49.070" style="s2">I can share with you a very classic</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.420" end="01:24:50.900" style="s2">that&#39;s called the male on trial of</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.070" end="01:24:52.969" style="s2">conflict what happens is people get</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.900" end="01:24:55.219" style="s2">initial impulses and then they have what</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.969" end="01:24:57.170" style="s2">are called secondary anxiety inhibitor</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.219" end="01:24:58.880" style="s2">responses to that initial impulse and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.170" end="01:25:01.489" style="s2">then they develop rationalizing</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.880" end="01:25:04.760" style="s2">basically mechanisms so they</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.489" end="01:25:06.380" style="s2">don&#39;t attend to the original impulse and</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.760" end="01:25:08.719" style="s2">what will happen is it&#39;s organized by</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.380" end="01:25:11.060" style="s2">emotion and image and it will build</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.719" end="01:25:13.489" style="s2">inside of people and so that you could</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.060" end="01:25:15.980" style="s2">see that there&#39;s actually of their sub</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.489" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">personality that doesn&#39;t have ready</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.980" end="01:25:19.610" style="s2">access they have intuitive access</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:21.770" style="s2">because it makes them really anxious and</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.610" end="01:25:24.199" style="s2">the whole of much of the therapy work is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.770" end="01:25:25.969" style="s2">shining the light on that shadow which</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.199" end="01:25:27.739" style="s2">they&#39;ve blocked off based on cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.969" end="01:25:30.199" style="s2">dissonance I mean Connie this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.739" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">very documental phenomenon of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.199" end="01:25:33.530" style="s2">interpreter function of the left</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:34.760" style="s2">hemisphere the therapy process is</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.530" end="01:25:37.219" style="s2">figuring out ways in which you could</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.760" end="01:25:38.780" style="s2">integrate those senses of vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.219" end="01:25:40.370" style="s2">and make them whole and</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.780" end="01:25:42.440" style="s2">and if you actually do that then we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.370" end="01:25:44.060" style="s2">achieve sovereignty within ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.440" end="01:25:45.800" style="s2">between ourselves because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.060" end="01:25:47.300" style="s2">trying to anymore we actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.800" end="01:25:49.370" style="s2">have a holistic picture of what our</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.300" end="01:25:51.410" style="s2">heart wants and what our what we believe</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.370" end="01:25:52.910" style="s2">and what we say to other people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.410" end="01:25:54.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what we want we don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.910" end="01:25:55.460" style="s2">bunch of bull shooters to themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.800" end="01:25:57.320" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.460" end="01:25:59.660" style="s2">that makes sense and then those so the</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.320" end="01:26:01.550" style="s2">shadow work is then getting those things</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.660" end="01:26:03.200" style="s2">out of the shadow so you can see them</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.550" end="01:26:05.360" style="s2">and do something about them is that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.200" end="01:26:07.340" style="s2">right that&#39;s right exactly then you try</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.360" end="01:26:08.450" style="s2">to have corrective emotional experiences</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.340" end="01:26:10.250" style="s2">where you help people</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.450" end="01:26:13.130" style="s2">both empathize why they blocked them off</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.250" end="01:26:14.900" style="s2">originally and and sort of deconstruct</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.130" end="01:26:17.000" style="s2">their beliefs about why they had to and</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.900" end="01:26:19.670" style="s2">then what does it mean make them feel a</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.000" end="01:26:21.500" style="s2">little less defensive integrate the pain</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.670" end="01:26:23.510" style="s2">which is always painful when it happens</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.500" end="01:26:25.490" style="s2">but if you&#39;re able to hold that pain and</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.510" end="01:26:27.710" style="s2">be aware and it tuned to it and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.490" end="01:26:29.990" style="s2">recognize that you can adaptively grow</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.710" end="01:26:32.090" style="s2">from it well then you integrate that</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.990" end="01:26:33.530" style="s2">weakness and then ultimately do this</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.090" end="01:26:35.360" style="s2">that&#39;s doing the shadow work and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.530" end="01:26:36.830" style="s2">become a whole or stronger person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.360" end="01:26:38.630" style="s2">actually able to learn and grow because</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.830" end="01:26:40.130" style="s2">if you&#39;re not a lot of shadow you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.630" end="01:26:41.870" style="s2">actually can&#39;t learn and grow because</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.130" end="01:26:44.510" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly defending pretending</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.870" end="01:26:45.770" style="s2">of the way the world has to be because</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.510" end="01:26:47.360" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid that if you discover what</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.770" end="01:26:49.700" style="s2">really is then everything&#39;s gonna come</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.360" end="01:26:51.770" style="s2">crashing down makes perfectly good sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.700" end="01:26:54.410" style="s2">good visible clearest definition I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.770" end="01:26:56.150" style="s2">ever heard about it now another question</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.410" end="01:26:59.210" style="s2">I had when I was you know reading about</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.150" end="01:27:00.800" style="s2">your justification hypothesis and how it</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.210" end="01:27:02.750" style="s2">you know how and in this river I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.800" end="01:27:05.150" style="s2">thinking about how it worked etc could</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.750" end="01:27:07.940" style="s2">you describe how it works inter works</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.150" end="01:27:10.970" style="s2">part is part of and is different somehow</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.940" end="01:27:12.860" style="s2">then culture itself so the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.970" end="01:27:14.930" style="s2">between the justification hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.860" end="01:27:17.180" style="s2">culture great seems like they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.930" end="01:27:18.860" style="s2">similar concepts all right so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.180" end="01:27:20.600" style="s2">hypothesis and then I wasn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.860" end="01:27:22.610" style="s2">super clear of my language I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.600" end="01:27:24.620" style="s2">that and especially back in 2011 I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.610" end="01:27:26.570" style="s2">less clear so here&#39;s the deal the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.620" end="01:27:28.310" style="s2">hypothesis is the idea about what</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.570" end="01:27:30.650" style="s2">happened with language that it reaches a</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.310" end="01:27:32.990" style="s2">tipping point in propositions okay and</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.650" end="01:27:34.220" style="s2">question and answer dynamics and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.990" end="01:27:35.920" style="s2">all of a sudden that question answer</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.220" end="01:27:38.660" style="s2">Dynamis gives rise to the social</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.920" end="01:27:40.310" style="s2">justification problem then that shapes</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.660" end="01:27:41.780" style="s2">the mental organ of the self</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.310" end="01:27:43.490" style="s2">consciousness system into this mental</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.780" end="01:27:45.830" style="s2">organ of justification that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.490" end="01:27:48.020" style="s2">hypothesis then what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.830" end="01:27:49.940" style="s2">this really shapes the model of human</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.020" end="01:27:50.450" style="s2">consciousness which I was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.940" end="01:27:52.790" style="s2">which is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.450" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">crime experiential the private narrator</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.790" end="01:27:56.030" style="s2">and the public</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:27:58.220" style="s2">okay those three domains and then this</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.030" end="01:28:01.040" style="s2">is the third part of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.220" end="01:28:02.960" style="s2">justification systems which is and this</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.040" end="01:28:05.180" style="s2">should be familiar to you this is idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.960" end="01:28:08.090" style="s2">then that these belief systems can be</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.180" end="01:28:10.480" style="s2">thought of as language based memes okay</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.090" end="01:28:13.430" style="s2">that then start to grow and replicate as</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.480" end="01:28:16.490" style="s2">ideas of what is legitimate and what is</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.430" end="01:28:18.260" style="s2">not so then instruct to take off systems</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.490" end="01:28:21.770" style="s2">of justification these become the</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.260" end="01:28:24.620" style="s2">ideologies norms rules of a house rules</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.770" end="01:28:27.470" style="s2">of a tribe rules of culture what then is</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.620" end="01:28:29.810" style="s2">actually legitimate and so what culture</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.470" end="01:28:31.220" style="s2">is with a capital seed I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.810" end="01:28:32.750" style="s2">clear because you know I&#39;m using a</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.220" end="01:28:34.220" style="s2">technical definition some people say</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.750" end="01:28:35.450" style="s2">well animals have culture and it really</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.220" end="01:28:38.120" style="s2">depends on how you find it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.450" end="01:28:41.090" style="s2">true how I&#39;m defining culture are these</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.120" end="01:28:42.920" style="s2">large scale systems of justification</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.090" end="01:28:45.560" style="s2">language based beliefs and values that</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.920" end="01:28:47.090" style="s2">legitimize is an AW across a wide</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.560" end="01:28:48.890" style="s2">variety of different contexts so they</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.090" end="01:28:50.660" style="s2">organize our institutions to think about</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.890" end="01:28:52.130" style="s2">the institutional law you think about</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.660" end="01:28:54.590" style="s2">the institution you know of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.130" end="01:28:57.500" style="s2">universities what is legitimate well how</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.590" end="01:28:59.900" style="s2">are they fine then out of that core then</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.500" end="01:29:01.640" style="s2">becomes a hierarchy of statements that</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.900" end="01:29:04.790" style="s2">are more or less central and those</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.640" end="01:29:08.300" style="s2">become organizing systems cultural codes</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.790" end="01:29:11.540" style="s2">that give us the rules and regulations</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.300" end="01:29:13.610" style="s2">and so culture then is those systems</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.540" end="01:29:16.160" style="s2">higher order large-scale systems of</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.610" end="01:29:18.590" style="s2">justification give up norms ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.160" end="01:29:20.420" style="s2">networks of propositions that allow us</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.590" end="01:29:21.410" style="s2">to make meaning out of the world things</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.420" end="01:29:25.040" style="s2">along those lines</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.410" end="01:29:27.710" style="s2">yeah then presumably our culture builds</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.040" end="01:29:30.050" style="s2">in us some of our justifications right</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.710" end="01:29:31.820" style="s2">exactly train is the little kid not to</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.050" end="01:29:34.130" style="s2">spit on the sidewalk because it&#39;s rude</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.820" end="01:29:35.990" style="s2">and you see somebody else spit on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.130" end="01:29:37.970" style="s2">sidewalk do you have some rule why</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.990" end="01:29:40.340" style="s2">they&#39;re you know they&#39;re bad right</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.970" end="01:29:41.840" style="s2">essentially or or you don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.340" end="01:29:44.150" style="s2">because you know that it sends a bad</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.840" end="01:29:46.730" style="s2">signal about you being rude so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.150" end="01:29:49.100" style="s2">feedback obviously between culture and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.730" end="01:29:51.440" style="s2">the justifications that one has built</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.100" end="01:29:52.970" style="s2">into one&#39;s own system completely she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.440" end="01:29:54.500" style="s2">completely iterative feedback loop so</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.970" end="01:29:56.060" style="s2">normally we get born into the</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.500" end="01:29:57.620" style="s2">large-scale systems of justification I</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.060" end="01:29:59.630" style="s2">would say obviously if I are born in</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.620" end="01:30:01.250" style="s2">Saudi Arabia before I&#39;m born five</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.630" end="01:30:02.200" style="s2">thousand years ago my belief value</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.250" end="01:30:04.780" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.200" end="01:30:06.250" style="s2">different because my parents and the and</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.780" end="01:30:07.540" style="s2">the civilization and cultures that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.250" end="01:30:10.180" style="s2">were around would have given me</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.540" end="01:30:12.790" style="s2">radically different ideologies and at</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.180" end="01:30:14.650" style="s2">first we are social actors that&#39;s a term</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.790" end="01:30:17.350" style="s2">that sort of absorbs the scripts the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.650" end="01:30:18.730" style="s2">rules the regulations as kids of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.350" end="01:30:20.500" style="s2">appropriate and then we just deploy</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.730" end="01:30:22.930" style="s2">those and then we have become as</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.500" end="01:30:24.400" style="s2">adolescents we&#39;ve become agents where we</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.930" end="01:30:26.380" style="s2">start to actually get some ways of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.400" end="01:30:28.120" style="s2">thinking about these rules that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.380" end="01:30:29.560" style="s2">raised out a teenager&#39;s nose that</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.120" end="01:30:31.660" style="s2">actually they could say hey mom and dad</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.560" end="01:30:33.580" style="s2">fu you know you know you know gives you</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.660" end="01:30:35.140" style="s2">the right and by that time they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.580" end="01:30:36.550" style="s2">you know maybe journalize the convention</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.140" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">and now starting to challenge where that</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.550" end="01:30:41.320" style="s2">authority comes from and ultimately we</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:43.360" style="s2">want individuals to you know reclaim and</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.320" end="01:30:45.550" style="s2">full adulthood their own narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.360" end="01:30:47.400" style="s2">see the narrative arc of our lives in</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.550" end="01:30:49.420" style="s2">relationship to culture and of course</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.400" end="01:30:51.760" style="s2">sophisticated people that do that that</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.420" end="01:30:53.710" style="s2">then live lives a say of Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.760" end="01:30:56.170" style="s2">King that then lives lies the feedback</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.710" end="01:30:58.240" style="s2">on to the culture and says hey no this</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.170" end="01:31:00.310" style="s2">justification system about you know Jim</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.240" end="01:31:02.500" style="s2">Crow laws and black/white segregation</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.310" end="01:31:04.810" style="s2">that&#39;s all that&#39;s horribly unfair and</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.500" end="01:31:06.220" style="s2">here&#39;s an example are of a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.810" end="01:31:08.020" style="s2">human being and if what you said about</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.220" end="01:31:09.610" style="s2">black people was true how is this</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.020" end="01:31:11.830" style="s2">possible and here&#39;s another narrative</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.610" end="01:31:14.080" style="s2">justification for how we can live and</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.830" end="01:31:16.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a higher close to ethical more</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.080" end="01:31:18.850" style="s2">Universal ethical principles well that</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.570" end="01:31:21.130" style="s2">reasoning process kicks in and people</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.850" end="01:31:23.920" style="s2">justify particular ways and voila you</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.130" end="01:31:25.930" style="s2">get them individuals leading the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.920" end="01:31:27.820" style="s2">culture and creating transformations</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.930" end="01:31:29.170" style="s2">back into the system so it&#39;s a complete</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.820" end="01:31:31.270" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.170" end="01:31:32.740" style="s2">kids get socialized into it and then</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.270" end="01:31:34.000" style="s2">people start to challenge it some and</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.740" end="01:31:36.370" style="s2">find their place in it and a couple</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.000" end="01:31:37.990" style="s2">people end up really shooting into the</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.370" end="01:31:41.410" style="s2">world and changing the systems of</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.990" end="01:31:43.390" style="s2">justification radically very good well I</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.410" end="01:31:44.830" style="s2">think we&#39;re getting kind of close on our</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.390" end="01:31:47.410" style="s2">time here is there anything else you</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.830" end="01:31:49.300" style="s2">want to say to wrap up your theory yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.410" end="01:31:51.970" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to bring it back to Gabby</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.300" end="01:31:54.580" style="s2">and and also let us think a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.970" end="01:31:56.320" style="s2">about where we are at this moment a</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.580" end="01:31:57.910" style="s2">number of the circles that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.320" end="01:31:59.830" style="s2">listening to and hanging out and doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.910" end="01:32:02.770" style="s2">podcasts and talk about the Kairos of</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.830" end="01:32:05.200" style="s2">the moment of course with the co vid 19</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.770" end="01:32:08.020" style="s2">crisis and I know you&#39;ve been talking a</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.200" end="01:32:09.810" style="s2">lot about as so many people thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.020" end="01:32:11.920" style="s2">about the global East act</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.810" end="01:32:14.739" style="s2">interdependencies that make our system</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.920" end="01:32:17.440" style="s2">very very fragile and what kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.739" end="01:32:19.269" style="s2">stones can we hope for in terms of you</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.440" end="01:32:21.309" style="s2">know achieving a better understanding so</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.269" end="01:32:24.579" style="s2">we can move towards a much more</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.309" end="01:32:26.199" style="s2">sustainable robust anti fragile future I</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.579" end="01:32:28.239" style="s2">think the tree of knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.199" end="01:32:30.699" style="s2">unified theory of psychology provides a</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.239" end="01:32:32.710" style="s2">piece of this puzzle first</p>

<p begin="01:32:32.710" end="01:32:37.210" style="s2">tries to help us understand what kind of</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.780" end="01:32:47.289" style="s2">of that and the other thing that the</p>

<p begin="01:32:51.610" end="01:32:56.559" style="s2">what is happening to us is each one of</p>

<p begin="01:33:01.449" end="01:33:06.880" style="s2">system ok so what it says is if a novel</p>

<p begin="01:33:10.570" end="01:33:14.590" style="s2">together then all of a sudden you could</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.760" end="01:33:16.659" style="s2">give rise to a whole new dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.590" end="01:33:19.570" style="s2">complexity this is by the way what I</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.659" end="01:33:21.789" style="s2">call the fifth joint point ok so the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.570" end="01:33:24.579" style="s2">fifth joint point is the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.789" end="01:33:26.559" style="s2">actually we may be in the process of an</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.579" end="01:33:29.139" style="s2">emergent evolution of a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.559" end="01:33:31.510" style="s2">complex adaptive plane indeed the idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.139" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">that we&#39;re in the in the exists of a</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.510" end="01:33:35.980" style="s2">shift into the world of the digital</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:38.380" style="s2">whereby over the 20th century we built</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.980" end="01:33:39.610" style="s2">these computers we build artificial</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.380" end="01:33:42.039" style="s2">intelligent systems that were going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.610" end="01:33:44.619" style="s2">interact with with increasing degrees of</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.039" end="01:33:47.409" style="s2">interface that we connected in networks</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.619" end="01:33:48.039" style="s2">the Internet of course the Internet of</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.409" end="01:33:50.440" style="s2">Things</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.039" end="01:33:52.059" style="s2">we are fusing with the digital and this</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.440" end="01:33:53.800" style="s2">is an entirely new information</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.059" end="01:33:56.139" style="s2">processing communication system a</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.800" end="01:33:59.050" style="s2">futurist by the name of Oliver Reiser</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.139" end="01:34:02.980" style="s2">called this of the world since aureum</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.050" end="01:34:05.619" style="s2">and back in 1958 which have done notion</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.980" end="01:34:07.630" style="s2">so here&#39;s my pitch is that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.619" end="01:34:10.329" style="s2">in a very very complicated phase where</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.630" end="01:34:11.590" style="s2">our old institutional systems that were</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.329" end="01:34:13.659" style="s2">built on different kinds of information</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.590" end="01:34:15.999" style="s2">processing communication really are</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.659" end="01:34:18.010" style="s2">getting deeply pressed in the world but</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.999" end="01:34:20.050" style="s2">we live our is very complicated and</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.010" end="01:34:22.150" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot of chaotic flux with</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.050" end="01:34:24.280" style="s2">a lot of fragility I think we need some</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.150" end="01:34:25.140" style="s2">seriously new thinking I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.280" end="01:34:27.330" style="s2">been leading the way</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.140" end="01:34:29.160" style="s2">some of that thinking absolutely and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.330" end="01:34:31.740" style="s2">think what we need essentially used to a</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.160" end="01:34:34.170" style="s2">language like game be a language like</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.740" end="01:34:35.820" style="s2">the fifth joint point and say hey this</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.170" end="01:34:38.010" style="s2">21st century is going to be a massive</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.820" end="01:34:39.630" style="s2">flux we have to think wisely about this</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.010" end="01:34:41.310" style="s2">we can&#39;t expect the world just to</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.630" end="01:34:42.840" style="s2">continue the way it&#39;s been going we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.310" end="01:34:44.460" style="s2">to think seriously about how to</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.840" end="01:34:46.380" style="s2">understand our natures understand the</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.460" end="01:34:49.140" style="s2">environment the tech that we&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.380" end="01:34:51.630" style="s2">merge those together into a sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.140" end="01:34:53.040" style="s2">wise ecology going forward and the Tree</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.630" end="01:34:55.770" style="s2">of Knowledge provides an angle on that</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.040" end="01:34:57.030" style="s2">as well wow I love it well I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.770" end="01:34:58.980" style="s2">gonna wrap it up right there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.030" end="01:35:02.150" style="s2">think we could we could go any further</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.980" end="01:35:05.400" style="s2">or say much more thank you Greg for a</p>
