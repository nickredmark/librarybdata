<p begin="00:00:01.310" end="00:00:07.250" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ve hit the record button</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.449" end="00:00:08.400" style="s2">now so we&#39;ve been meeting to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.250" end="00:00:10.860" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">well actually Arthur and I have over a</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.860" end="00:00:15.170" style="s2">number of months and the four of us with</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:17.130" style="s2">a couple other additions met for</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.170" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">conversation at the end of last year and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">before things in the world changed quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">a bit and these conversations for me are</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:29.880" style="s2">about us coming together to do in fact</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">what we&#39;ve begun discussing already and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.880" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">it&#39;s that mixture of tuning into what to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">care about and understanding how to take</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:43.399" style="s2">effective action to make effective</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:43.399" style="s2">choices in light of that so so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.199" end="00:00:50.899" style="s2">perhaps I could say a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.600" end="00:00:52.579" style="s2">what I take this in fact to be and bring</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.899" end="00:00:54.409" style="s2">in a couple figures that I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.579" end="00:00:56.479" style="s2">influenced influenced some of us here in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.409" end="00:01:00.619" style="s2">various ways one of them Nora Bateson I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.479" end="00:01:02.360" style="s2">know James you are interested in her</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.619" end="00:01:08.210" style="s2">work and had been a collaborator of hers</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.360" end="00:01:11.539" style="s2">and so the the term that I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.210" end="00:01:13.850" style="s2">helpful she has a term called samatha C</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.539" end="00:01:15.649" style="s2">and I I don&#39;t know how the term that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.850" end="00:01:18.770" style="s2">term itself is going to catch but but</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.649" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2">the meaning is one that I very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.770" end="00:01:23.270" style="s2">wants to do my part in helping to catch</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.750" end="00:01:26.810" style="s2">and that is this notion of a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.270" end="00:01:29.659" style="s2">learning environment and Arthur this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.810" end="00:01:31.729" style="s2">something I think you can speak to with</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.659" end="00:01:33.229" style="s2">a with loads of fidelity and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.729" end="00:01:36.440" style="s2">bunch of things to say about that as</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.229" end="00:01:38.030" style="s2">well because what is learning okay what</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.440" end="00:01:41.299" style="s2">does it mean to mutually learn how can</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.030" end="00:01:42.860" style="s2">we participate together and when we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.299" end="00:01:45.289" style="s2">the notion of environment we have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.860" end="00:01:47.929" style="s2">understanding that well together we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.289" end="00:01:51.259" style="s2">a part of and creating a context which</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.929" end="00:01:54.679" style="s2">itself is enabling informing our</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.259" end="00:01:58.129" style="s2">education as well and it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.679" end="00:02:00.769" style="s2">the creation the all of these mutual</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.129" end="00:02:03.170" style="s2">learning environments primarily to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.769" end="00:02:07.039" style="s2">with I think given the time we&#39;re in to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.170" end="00:02:10.129" style="s2">take place online in a forum just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.039" end="00:02:12.709" style="s2">this with 2 to 10 to 20 people who knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.129" end="00:02:15.340" style="s2">how many we can really get this to work</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.709" end="00:02:18.890" style="s2">with it&#39;s an extremely powerful one</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.340" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">because if anyone who could be listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.890" end="00:02:26.209" style="s2">or watching this right now at least from</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:28.340" style="s2">my perspective the the call to action is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.209" end="00:02:29.659" style="s2">now quite explicit where previously I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.340" end="00:02:32.540" style="s2">been trying to have conversations in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.659" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">way that helped inform people and spark</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.540" end="00:02:39.019" style="s2">some insight and communicate a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:41.269" style="s2">resonance that might entice someone to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.019" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">engage in a conversation a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.269" end="00:02:47.209" style="s2">of way creatively philosophically about</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:49.010" style="s2">what&#39;s worth caring about to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.209" end="00:02:51.540" style="s2">process of understanding to become more</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.010" end="00:02:53.909" style="s2">in touch with themselves and the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.540" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">this is more explicit now like this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.909" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">about actually do the thing and come and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.140" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">do it here come and be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:08.040" style="s2">conversation be part of conversations in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:12.500" style="s2">akin networks and then have those</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.040" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">networks intermingle this is about</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.500" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">actively participating in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">what&#39;s going on through creating a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:22.409" style="s2">shared sense of understanding with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:27.629" style="s2">other participating in a shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.409" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s that&#39;s seeking from</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.629" end="00:03:34.579" style="s2">the heart from a place of what&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">caring about what is effective to do and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.579" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s always a privilege for me to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:41.459" style="s2">have the opportunity to do that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">really grateful for you guys being here</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.459" end="00:03:48.659" style="s2">and yeah I so we&#39;ve been talking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">about half an hour now and we&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.659" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">time just turned the recording button on</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:55.919" style="s2">recently so I&#39;d be interested to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">and I do think we&#39;ve crystallized some</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.919" end="00:04:01.019" style="s2">themes and so I&#39;d be interested to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:05.389" style="s2">maybe James to hear your sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.019" end="00:04:08.129" style="s2">of how you&#39;ve been observing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.389" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">interaction now and if you&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.129" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">sense of the point you made to begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">with was that you&#39;ve been going through</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">a process of really looking to pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:21.389" style="s2">attention to discern what&#39;s worth paying</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:24.199" style="s2">attention to what&#39;s valuable like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.389" end="00:04:26.580" style="s2">are we valuing our society what am i</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.199" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">coming to value more is an individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.580" end="00:04:34.260" style="s2">and then how to act from there I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">wondering if like how you&#39;re feeling in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.260" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">this moment in light of what I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">said in light of what we&#39;ve shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">together with respect to all of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.020" end="00:04:55.349" style="s2">okay so what is what is coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">is a maybe you need for clarity around</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.349" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">what we what we mean by action you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:03.380" style="s2">I made the point earlier when we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:07.920" style="s2">recording around</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.380" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">that that for me it felt like it there</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.920" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">was there was it felt like a call to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:15.060" style="s2">action and then I&#39;ve receded that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">that&#39;s receded for me and then it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.060" end="00:05:21.480" style="s2">of a call into into into into more</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:25.350" style="s2">presence and just just noticing to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">what was most salient and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:35.370" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get out there is that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">the impulse to to action of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:39.690" style="s2">kind and I think we should probably come</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">back around to that what we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.690" end="00:05:52.610" style="s2">action that that impulse a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">can come from I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.610" end="00:06:01.380" style="s2">within our culture which places a high</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.770" end="00:06:03.710" style="s2">premium on on action and I guess what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.380" end="00:06:08.250" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m being called into is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.710" end="00:06:12.420" style="s2">humility so it&#39;s not a denial of action</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.250" end="00:06:18.210" style="s2">but it is a acceptance in this instant</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.420" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">that that we are in as Arthur put it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.210" end="00:06:25.410" style="s2">in a moment of chaos insofar as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">high uncertainty it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.410" end="00:06:29.220" style="s2">discern here cause and effect if if at</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.190" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.220" end="00:06:35.910" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a requirement to come to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.190" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">terms with that and and there is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.910" end="00:06:40.860" style="s2">impulse which I&#39;ve noticed in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:43.290" style="s2">professional circles and elsewhere also</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.860" end="00:06:45.810" style="s2">and even just in what I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.290" end="00:06:51.900" style="s2">unfolding in in the media there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.810" end="00:06:55.830" style="s2">impulse to act to control act to are to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.900" end="00:06:59.640" style="s2">to manage and I&#39;m noticing the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.830" end="00:07:03.260" style="s2">language that is being used even in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.640" end="00:07:06.780" style="s2">so far as that is being attempted its to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.260" end="00:07:10.650" style="s2">clearly define the enemy and it&#39;s to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.780" end="00:07:14.229" style="s2">on to a war footing and it&#39;s to wage a a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.650" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">fierce battle and defeat</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.229" end="00:07:22.060" style="s2">this this thing which to me reeks of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:24.219" style="s2">more of the same more of the same mom</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.060" end="00:07:29.259" style="s2">from what we&#39;ve always done and I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.219" end="00:07:30.879" style="s2">completely expect that to have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.259" end="00:07:33.460" style="s2">pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.879" end="00:07:36.550" style="s2">yes shortcomings if not outright our</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.460" end="00:07:42.840" style="s2">failing is in the in the months ahead</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.550" end="00:07:49.539" style="s2">and so when I&#39;m talking about a greater</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.840" end="00:07:52.360" style="s2">sort of stillness and and their presence</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.539" end="00:07:56.259" style="s2">in order to notice what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.360" end="00:08:01.300" style="s2">about there is a as a kind of humility</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.259" end="00:08:05.110" style="s2">which at the outset that that that any</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.300" end="00:08:07.659" style="s2">any action that we might do we might</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.149" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">obvious circumstance there&#39;s a direct</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:14.970" style="s2">you know if I do this that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:16.709" style="s2">happen if I drop my pen that&#39;s gonna</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.110" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">not known at the time it can be learnt</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.949" end="00:11:34.860" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:38.730" style="s2">so the difference for is simple and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.860" end="00:11:39.660" style="s2">complicated is that you can you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.730" end="00:11:42.080" style="s2">right now if</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.660" end="00:11:43.770" style="s2">simple you can come to learn it and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.080" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">understand the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.770" end="00:11:50.820" style="s2">cause and effect in the complicated</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.230" end="00:12:00.300" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with and human society is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:03.660" style="s2">complex it&#39;s not complicated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.300" end="00:12:09.450" style="s2">complex what that means is there is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.660" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">a predictable or repeatable relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.450" end="00:12:14.520" style="s2">between cause and effect now we can come</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:17.820" style="s2">to understand why things happen in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.520" end="00:12:20.330" style="s2">retrospect but we can&#39;t reliably predict</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.810" end="00:12:32.600" style="s2">can actually cause more damage than</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.600" end="00:12:38.540" style="s2">we know is based on past contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.630" end="00:12:40.580" style="s2">past patterns now if we go back and look</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.540" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">at you know previous pandemics and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:59.250" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do is is to get</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.140" end="00:13:14.280" style="s2">us I mean if you think you know what to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.480" end="00:13:16.080" style="s2">do a less humble person was our life</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.280" end="00:13:18.900" style="s2">this is easy we just got to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">do that you know chances are you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.900" end="00:13:23.700" style="s2">kill lots and lots of people and in in</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.890" end="00:13:28.620" style="s2">and no no no no we&#39;re gonna be back to</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.510" end="00:13:35.160" style="s2">you know sort of Americans have more</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.700" end="00:14:02.010" style="s2">and then make sense of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.150" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t know use the bits that are</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.940" end="00:16:01.510" style="s2">nevertheless the courage to actually act</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.870" end="00:16:03.160" style="s2">and make sense of that as we go which i</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.510" end="00:16:04.900" style="s2">think is a really interesting dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.160" end="00:16:08.550" style="s2">that we can use to understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.900" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">to participate in a conversation itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.550" end="00:16:16.030" style="s2">because often we can come to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:18.820" style="s2">interactions and think we know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.030" end="00:16:20.380" style="s2">to say right someone opens their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.820" end="00:16:21.940" style="s2">and starts talking and we know already</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.380" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">what we want to say in response</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.940" end="00:16:27.940" style="s2">oh but the macrocosm of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:29.890" style="s2">situation that&#39;s playing out in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.940" end="00:16:31.030" style="s2">world right now it&#39;s it&#39;s quite easy for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.890" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">people to look out the window and see</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.030" end="00:16:34.630" style="s2">people don&#39;t really know actually what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:37.330" style="s2">quite going on here we can&#39;t really make</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.630" end="00:16:40.600" style="s2">sense of it and that very process it</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.330" end="00:16:45.520" style="s2">also plays out in a microcosm of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.600" end="00:16:49.270" style="s2">conversation so we can learn I think how</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.520" end="00:16:49.690" style="s2">to be in a better relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.270" end="00:16:52.090" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.690" end="00:16:53.890" style="s2">through learning what it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.090" end="00:16:56.290" style="s2">better relationship with each other in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.890" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">the process of making sense itself in it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.290" end="00:17:04.150" style="s2">and and I wonder the process like when</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:07.150" style="s2">people here making sense I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.150" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a selection of the population</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.150" end="00:17:12.459" style="s2">who hears that and thinks it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:14.850" style="s2">a too restrictive intellectual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.459" end="00:17:17.890" style="s2">matter in a way that&#39;s prohibitive and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.850" end="00:17:19.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s been prohibitive of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.890" end="00:17:21.010" style="s2">them being a part of because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.480" end="00:17:24.089" style="s2">oh I&#39;m not I&#39;m not smart you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.010" end="00:17:26.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t do that or I feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.089" end="00:17:29.530" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t feel worthy of doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.350" end="00:17:31.290" style="s2">that kind of thing you know or this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.530" end="00:17:33.550" style="s2">going too fast for me or something and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.290" end="00:17:35.650" style="s2">often it&#39;s really that they&#39;re having an</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.550" end="00:17:37.150" style="s2">emotional response to the thing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.650" end="00:17:38.920" style="s2">not really even an intellectual response</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.150" end="00:17:40.120" style="s2">they&#39;re having an emotional response in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.920" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">relationship to their own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.120" end="00:17:44.590" style="s2">identity in a space and and and the key</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.750" style="s2">thing here is to recognize that actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.590" end="00:17:48.700" style="s2">emotions are a totally reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.750" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">necessary part of this and always</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.700" end="00:17:52.630" style="s2">involved and so making sense is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:54.520" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.630" end="00:17:56.860" style="s2">not some just a purely abstract thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.520" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a deep it&#39;s it&#39;s crucial to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.860" end="00:18:01.390" style="s2">oriented we are already oriented by</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:03.190" style="s2">something we&#39;re caring about and those</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.390" end="00:18:05.140" style="s2">who are more in touch with what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.190" end="00:18:10.090" style="s2">they are caring about and more in touch</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.140" end="00:18:11.890" style="s2">with their emotions and can be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:14.650" style="s2">relationship with others through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.890" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">process of making sense are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.650" end="00:18:21.790" style="s2">crucial to the whole the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:23.920" style="s2">here so this humility thing is really</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.790" end="00:18:26.530" style="s2">interesting because we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.920" end="00:18:28.360" style="s2">willing to say I don&#39;t know and sit in</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.530" end="00:18:30.190" style="s2">that and people are always talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.360" end="00:18:33.550" style="s2">that you know be with the not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.190" end="00:18:35.290" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean to say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.550" end="00:18:38.200" style="s2">with division the people who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.290" end="00:18:44.050" style="s2">this are invariably people I respect for</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.200" end="00:18:46.420" style="s2">that kind of wisdom and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.050" end="00:18:48.910" style="s2">part of it that is this attempt then to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.420" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">say some things about what we maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.910" end="00:18:53.470" style="s2">know because it&#39;s not about being stuck</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">not knowing we are doing both things</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.470" end="00:18:58.570" style="s2">right so the courage then to step out</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:02.770" style="s2">and express you know like what is it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:04.990" style="s2">have understood so as an example of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.770" end="00:19:06.670" style="s2">own articulation James and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.990" end="00:19:08.530" style="s2">to turn it back on you in any way like</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.670" end="00:19:10.990" style="s2">that because I I know you I know you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.530" end="00:19:12.760" style="s2">know this but in the articulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.990" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">importance of coming into your not</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.760" end="00:19:16.390" style="s2">knowing you are communicating a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:18.070" style="s2">knowing you have about how to be in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.390" end="00:19:20.620" style="s2">right relationship with the process of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.070" end="00:19:23.140" style="s2">making sense of what they care about and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.620" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">making sense of the world so these are</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:26.410" style="s2">the kind of things I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:30.670" style="s2">to presents for people listening in to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.410" end="00:19:33.790" style="s2">in particular not knowing is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.670" end="00:19:35.740" style="s2">perfectly is it so important and having</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:38.740" style="s2">the courage to say you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.740" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">and then as a listener to recognize if</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.740" end="00:19:46.200" style="s2">you can add to that if you can help in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:50.890" style="s2">some way but but but not not to try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.200" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">not to try and go let&#39;s just chuck</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.890" end="00:19:56.800" style="s2">everything we can at this right now to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:58.330" style="s2">sit in that too and have the humility to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.800" end="00:20:02.290" style="s2">say look I can&#39;t speak to all of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">but here&#39;s what I do understand and how</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.290" end="00:20:06.230" style="s2">does that inform our situation</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.269" style="s2">this move - movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.230" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">collaboration and a sense that together</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.269" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">we we can be in touch with more is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.210" end="00:20:15.140" style="s2">something that I I just like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:16.519" style="s2">emphasize it just as a bit of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.140" end="00:20:19.580" style="s2">point about what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.519" end="00:20:22.519" style="s2">because as I said this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.580" end="00:20:29.269" style="s2">I I&#39;m inviting people very much to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.519" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">involved with hmm I think the UM Sakai</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.269" end="00:20:34.370" style="s2">dynamics that are at play here and not</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.679" style="s2">always at play and how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.370" end="00:20:38.990" style="s2">to to be thinking of that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.679" end="00:20:40.580" style="s2">when you&#39;re participating in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.990" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">conversation I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.580" end="00:20:44.870" style="s2">always been something of what was</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">remarkable but just coming off what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.870" end="00:20:50.990" style="s2">were saying Tim knowing maybe what level</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:54.529" style="s2">of attribution you&#39;re you&#39;re applying</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.990" end="00:20:56.779" style="s2">when you&#39;re participating or reacting or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.529" end="00:20:58.700" style="s2">responding okay well where are we having</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.779" end="00:21:01.159" style="s2">conversations that are on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.700" end="00:21:03.889" style="s2">of something that&#39;s directly observable</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.159" end="00:21:07.519" style="s2">as data as information that we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.889" end="00:21:11.059" style="s2">easily come around and inform of former</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.519" end="00:21:13.250" style="s2">pretty common view on why are we going</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.059" end="00:21:16.190" style="s2">up in you know ladders of inference</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.250" end="00:21:19.429" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to attribute personal</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.190" end="00:21:21.139" style="s2">values experiences that that create a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.429" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">reality around what&#39;s what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.139" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">observed and even further up where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:30.710" style="s2">starting to really apply those societal</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:33.320" style="s2">you know values and beliefs and mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.710" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">models that create the reality of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.320" end="00:21:39.620" style="s2">we&#39;re observing so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">and knowing that it&#39;s okay in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.620" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">conversation to be saying yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:45.770" style="s2">having an emotional reaction to this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">probably you know from an attribution</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.770" end="00:21:51.680" style="s2">perspective as I can it psychodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:54.230" style="s2">perspective I&#39;m I&#39;m sensing this in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.680" end="00:21:56.120" style="s2">feeling this through maybe a lens or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.230" end="00:21:59.390" style="s2">mental model that I&#39;ve created and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.120" end="00:22:01.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why I feel this way or perhaps my</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.390" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">contribution here is very heavily being</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.880" end="00:22:06.860" style="s2">affected by attribution that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:09.020" style="s2">societal views that I&#39;ve taken on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.860" end="00:22:11.180" style="s2">like that I see as truths or as mental</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.020" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">models that I ascribe to so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.180" end="00:22:16.460" style="s2">that that level of what we say humility</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.900" end="00:22:19.130" style="s2">part of that is the knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.460" end="00:22:21.530" style="s2">acceptance that it&#39;s okay and to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.130" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">reacting whether that is to directly</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.530" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">observable things that are easy to agree</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.780" style="s2">on or emotional reactions that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.430" style="s2">coming from there were many different</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.780" end="00:22:33.770" style="s2">personal mental models that we&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.430" end="00:22:36.140" style="s2">on all those societal models so I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.770" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s always remarkable in every</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">sense that in yourself but what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.180" end="00:22:46.670" style="s2">remarkable is being comfortable enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:49.610" style="s2">in a space to to make it known and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.670" end="00:22:52.580" style="s2">advocate and say actually I see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.610" end="00:22:54.500" style="s2">happening here my my mental model at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.580" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">moment is being driven by this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.500" end="00:23:01.540" style="s2">emotion attached to it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.540" style="s2">contributing this and it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.580" end="00:23:10.170" style="s2">that&#39;s um yeah that&#39;s I really felt that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.150" end="00:23:13.670" style="s2">that that deeply there&#39;s a and even I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.170" end="00:23:18.600" style="s2">guess in in your reflections Tim and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.670" end="00:23:21.480" style="s2">Angela just then on acknowledging I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.600" end="00:23:26.310" style="s2">guess where you are you are you running</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.480" end="00:23:30.800" style="s2">your scripts is important and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.310" end="00:23:30.800" style="s2">not to actually call that out as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:40.860" style="s2">necessarily as a as a problem but to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.340" end="00:23:42.930" style="s2">aware of it and I know that that Tim you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.860" end="00:23:45.390" style="s2">mentioned Nora Bateson then who and her</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.930" end="00:23:48.530" style="s2">work and I know that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.390" end="00:23:52.860" style="s2">observations from the warm data lab</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.530" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">experiences that actually the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.860" end="00:23:59.280" style="s2">it seems to work is because what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:03.240" style="s2">calls people into in terms of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.280" end="00:24:08.580" style="s2">interactions and those engagements with</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.240" end="00:24:13.800" style="s2">others is is a really human and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.580" end="00:24:18.360" style="s2">natural form of engagements of just</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.800" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">telling stories and so usually when when</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.360" end="00:24:26.700" style="s2">people are invited into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">of a particular topic we did a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.700" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">two different contexts and let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">context is the other topic is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:40.710" style="s2">well being in the context of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">Education and that question triggers</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.710" end="00:24:48.390" style="s2">them typically to tell a personal their</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">personal anecdote which is laden heavily</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.390" end="00:24:53.940" style="s2">with emotion and and that through that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:56.670" style="s2">exchange of others doing that and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.940" end="00:25:01.080" style="s2">mutual learning that that that they can</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.670" end="00:25:03.030" style="s2">they can therefore unfold is from from</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.080" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">those other it&#39;s it&#39;s with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.030" end="00:25:09.530" style="s2">perspective of of complexity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:12.730" style="s2">acknowledging that we as human beings as</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.530" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">our our sense making apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.730" end="00:25:19.390" style="s2">he&#39;s not completely like neocortex it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">not all about the rationality in actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.390" end="00:25:25.590" style="s2">fact the vast majority of it is whole of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.210" end="00:25:30.040" style="s2">body it it&#39;s its emotion it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.590" end="00:25:33.270" style="s2">intertwined and unless we can have</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.040" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">conversations where we are permitted and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.270" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">enabled to bring that completely to bear</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">then we&#39;re not bringing the the full</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">complexity of our how of our humanity to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:49.570" style="s2">bear and as a result the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">actions that we will I will formulate if</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.570" end="00:25:55.930" style="s2">that&#39;s the right language off the back</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:59.920" style="s2">of that are also not going to be complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.930" end="00:26:01.690" style="s2">and and I think that you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.920" end="00:26:04.570" style="s2">you mentioned here Dave Snowden&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.690" end="00:26:07.180" style="s2">work and I know that the the exercise in</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">that the anecdote on the Elector circles</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.180" end="00:26:14.410" style="s2">is playing on it of the same thing they</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">want people to be able to to give an</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.410" end="00:26:19.390" style="s2">experience from from within because</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:22.510" style="s2">that&#39;s going to give you the data that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.390" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">you need to be able to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.510" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">is the real experience not what is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:32.020" style="s2">a cold a statistical data telling you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:35.410" style="s2">what is the real lived experience of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.020" end="00:26:37.870" style="s2">complexity and what what are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.410" end="00:26:41.410" style="s2">interesting things if if anybody has any</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.870" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">any concerns about not be I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.410" end="00:26:44.770" style="s2">engage in this kind of process because</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s how I mind and all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.770" end="00:26:49.570" style="s2">intellectual and and after the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.920" end="00:26:51.850" style="s2">of this conversation it might be skewed</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.570" end="00:26:54.220" style="s2">in that direction just by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.850" end="00:26:57.450" style="s2">fact of each of our backgrounds but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.220" end="00:27:01.210" style="s2">absolutely critical that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.450" end="00:27:04.150" style="s2">that broader diversity which is able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.210" end="00:27:05.800" style="s2">sense making in different ways what</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.150" end="00:27:09.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve noticed with the world data labs</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.800" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">is that what it&#39;s brought into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.480" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">community of people who is say a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:20.830" style="s2">workplace or a university who are really</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:24.220" style="s2">hardwired in their in their roles as</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.830" end="00:27:26.260" style="s2">intellectuals as thickest also it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.220" end="00:27:28.900" style="s2">actually a flatter dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.260" end="00:27:31.930" style="s2">they actually have a harder time pulling</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.900" end="00:27:33.940" style="s2">out the complexity out of the question</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.930" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">that if you bring it into a community</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.940" end="00:27:39.790" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t have that level of education</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">who is operating on raw experience and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.790" end="00:27:44.050" style="s2">able to conjure the anecdotes been able</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:47.550" style="s2">to able to type I&#39;m going to tell that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.050" end="00:27:50.140" style="s2">first person the experience of the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.550" end="00:27:52.900" style="s2">and to be able to exchange that and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.140" end="00:27:54.580" style="s2">be able to then I then notice where are</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.900" end="00:27:59.020" style="s2">the points of tension where are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.580" end="00:28:01.840" style="s2">points of intersection that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.020" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">really really astounding or it should it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.840" end="00:28:07.240" style="s2">be but but it&#39;s like you know people</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:09.190" style="s2">have been I think it&#39;s probably only a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.240" end="00:28:12.160" style="s2">recent phenomenon where we&#39;ve where</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.190" end="00:28:16.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve we focus the sense-making right up</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.160" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">here you know and probably to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.600" end="00:28:21.430" style="s2">birth and then on the other hand to add</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:25.420" style="s2">a great detriment to because we&#39;ve it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.430" end="00:28:26.950" style="s2">it&#39;s reduced the solutions to to utter</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.420" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">things which don&#39;t do our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.950" end="00:28:35.800" style="s2">justice and so I yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:38.400" style="s2">that you know in part just I just coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.800" end="00:28:41.470" style="s2">back to that idea of the of the script</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.400" end="00:28:45.100" style="s2">what your are you running it to extent I</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.470" end="00:28:49.240" style="s2">I have to acknowledge that that called</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.100" end="00:28:53.110" style="s2">other context humility I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.240" end="00:28:55.960" style="s2">much of a script that actually is but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.110" end="00:28:59.640" style="s2">think words born of is partly an</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.960" end="00:29:03.850" style="s2">emotional reaction for for me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.640" end="00:29:06.630" style="s2">watching again and again the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.850" end="00:29:12.420" style="s2">violence that has been has been done by</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.630" end="00:29:16.090" style="s2">acting too soon and and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.420" end="00:29:19.510" style="s2">there is a slight recoil at that at that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.090" end="00:29:22.390" style="s2">at that notion and and so I&#39;m very I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.510" end="00:29:26.020" style="s2">I&#39;m watching that in myself as this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.390" end="00:29:28.600" style="s2">conversation is unfolding and and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.020" end="00:29:33.730" style="s2">but that&#39;s where it&#39;s born out of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.600" end="00:29:35.770" style="s2">born out of the deep desire to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.730" end="00:29:39.049" style="s2">kinds of unintended consequences that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.770" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2">have failed to avoid timer timing</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.049" end="00:29:49.399" style="s2">as as a as a civilization or even in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.700" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">individual lives so so thanks for I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.399" end="00:29:53.090" style="s2">guess helping to bring that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:56.749" style="s2">or around to be able to from you</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.090" end="00:30:00.129" style="s2">acknowledge that dig a bit deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.749" end="00:30:05.480" style="s2">what why that is we&#39;re on I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.129" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">yes it&#39;s beautifully articulated James</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.480" end="00:30:14.989" style="s2">really beautifully articulated yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">this optimization function of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.989" end="00:30:20.419" style="s2">neocortex yeah the the efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:25.639" style="s2">component is what came up for me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.419" end="00:30:28.999" style="s2">out there at the end there this this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.639" end="00:30:33.169" style="s2">mistake of yeah it&#39;s the mistake of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.999" end="00:30:36.830" style="s2">being who I suppose purely data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.169" end="00:30:41.450" style="s2">when you&#39;ve already defined the context</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:43.999" style="s2">in advance and the objective was just to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.450" end="00:30:48.429" style="s2">make more money in a shorter in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.999" end="00:30:53.389" style="s2">shorter more competitively successful</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.429" end="00:30:56.600" style="s2">way now that&#39;s obviously a bit broad to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.389" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">tar everything with that brush but there</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.600" end="00:31:02.210" style="s2">is a there is a clear relation there for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:07.960" style="s2">me it&#39;s if we isolate the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.210" end="00:31:07.960" style="s2">ourselves that just looked her optimize</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.220" end="00:31:18.529" style="s2">something that&#39;s been cut away from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.549" end="00:31:23.869" style="s2">whole there&#39;s value in that but only to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.529" end="00:31:28.029" style="s2">the extent that that has a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.869" end="00:31:31.669" style="s2">of adaptation again back to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.029" end="00:31:34.190" style="s2">and how do we tune back again into the</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.599" end="00:34:46.070" style="s2">there in in trying to perform you like</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.070" end="00:34:52.200" style="s2">that um that&#39;s something that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.619" end="00:34:53.790" style="s2">also I just I was trying to tether that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.200" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">to what ather was saying earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.790" end="00:35:04.380" style="s2">how you act how you act in a chaotic</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.230" end="00:35:14.190" style="s2">looks like and I&#39;m reminded of I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.300" end="00:35:17.940" style="s2">think it was does anyone know you you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.190" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">and simple at all no so he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.940" end="00:35:21.300" style="s2">actually a friend of danger students but</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:24.060" style="s2">so he was out in Gippsland</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.300" end="00:35:25.770" style="s2">late last year and he he reminded I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.060" end="00:35:28.460" style="s2">think I&#39;ve heard of previously but he</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.770" end="00:35:34.109" style="s2">reminded me of the concept of how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:37.530" style="s2">the special forces operate in</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.109" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">environments of uncertainty where the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.530" end="00:35:42.180" style="s2">battle-plan kind of goes awry and like</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:43.130" style="s2">as much as I loathe to use a war</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.180" end="00:35:45.050" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.130" end="00:35:48.890" style="s2">I think this can be quite easily adapted</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.050" end="00:35:53.510" style="s2">to a to two-piece time in great utility</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.890" end="00:35:57.560" style="s2">for in because it actually requires</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.510" end="00:35:59.540" style="s2">humility to be able to do so if if if</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.560" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">the battle plan goes awry then then</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.540" end="00:36:06.080" style="s2">their other their default position is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">is to do three things it&#39;s to is to keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.080" end="00:36:11.060" style="s2">moving this is to stay in touch and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:16.910" style="s2">it&#39;s to is to head for the high ground</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.060" end="00:36:20.270" style="s2">and that&#39;s not directed from from from</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.910" end="00:36:23.240" style="s2">the the war room because they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.270" end="00:36:26.210" style="s2">the context other local context in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.240" end="00:36:29.000" style="s2">any given you know squadron a battalion</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.210" end="00:36:31.340" style="s2">whoever is is operating so those</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.000" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">decisions have to be made and acted upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.340" end="00:36:37.700" style="s2">and locally and it&#39;s very much in terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:40.970" style="s2">of that act sense respond your framework</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.700" end="00:36:43.580" style="s2">and so what i i&#39;m reminded of there if</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.970" end="00:36:46.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the appropriate way to act in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.580" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">this environment if there are actions to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.310" end="00:36:53.390" style="s2">be done it seems to me that one really</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:56.920" style="s2">core component of that is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.390" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">acting in whatever capacity you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.920" end="00:37:03.770" style="s2">within the constraints of above that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:09.650" style="s2">capacity within whatever you consider to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.770" end="00:37:13.940" style="s2">be your local context and so and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.650" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">that could be geographically bounded but</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.940" end="00:37:19.250" style="s2">if you have have networks and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:23.090" style="s2">relationships that span the globe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.250" end="00:37:24.980" style="s2">you are able to able to consider a local</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.090" end="00:37:26.810" style="s2">to you in some sense then it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.980" end="00:37:31.820" style="s2">equally the same principle i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.810" end="00:37:33.710" style="s2">lost after have we we have he will make</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.820" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">his way back in again just like you did</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.710" end="00:37:37.250" style="s2">before so please continue james that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:41.120" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.250" end="00:37:43.070" style="s2">so is it&#39;s a and it&#39;s a way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.120" end="00:37:45.560" style="s2">back to that idea of the overwhelm that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.070" end="00:37:48.850" style="s2">can occur when you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.560" end="00:37:53.470" style="s2">your capacity in comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.850" end="00:37:53.470" style="s2">enormous size of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.069" end="00:38:02.900" style="s2">challenges the uncertainty that we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.109" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">ahead you know what&#39;s funny what came to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.900" end="00:38:09.740" style="s2">mind then was my daughter actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:12.559" style="s2">actually both my daughter&#39;s do a two and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.740" end="00:38:17.210" style="s2">four years old have been oddly obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.559" end="00:38:21.470" style="s2">with I was frozen to the dizzy film and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.210" end="00:38:25.759" style="s2">I know that the likes of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.470" end="00:38:27.619" style="s2">were not a big fan of frozen part one</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.759" end="00:38:30.200" style="s2">but I suspect that he might be really</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.619" end="00:38:34.700" style="s2">impressed by frozen too because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2">much more much more nuanced uh their</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.700" end="00:38:39.829" style="s2">storyline and it&#39;s really okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:43.039" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know how they how they how</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.829" end="00:38:45.349" style="s2">the creators came up with this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.039" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">really timely because what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.349" end="00:38:51.170" style="s2">describing have you have you seen the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">film edge thanks to you haven&#39;t seen I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.170" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">actually recommend it to you because</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:39:02.450" style="s2">what it it it seems to me like the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">narrative is informed heavily by ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:10.549" style="s2">about the liminal and about what you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:12.049" style="s2">when when there&#39;s such high uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.549" end="00:39:15.170" style="s2">even to the point where they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.049" end="00:39:20.289" style="s2">whole song in this which is about I</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.170" end="00:39:24.529" style="s2">think it was Princess Anna who sees when</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.289" end="00:39:27.410" style="s2">when you can see no future then then</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.529" end="00:39:31.309" style="s2">then the only thing you can do is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.410" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">next right thing if you kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.309" end="00:39:36.200" style="s2">like I said that now my daughter&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">know he&#39;s beginning to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.200" end="00:39:42.680" style="s2">how to operate in in the liminal with</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:45.470" style="s2">that very simple bit of of advice but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.680" end="00:39:50.029" style="s2">mean you know like Jack about it but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.470" end="00:39:51.890" style="s2">actuality there&#39;s that to make me back</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.029" end="00:39:55.400" style="s2">to this this idea of operating in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.890" end="00:39:58.230" style="s2">context of your of your of your local</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.400" end="00:40:00.930" style="s2">operating in the context of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.230" end="00:40:04.230" style="s2">you can perceive and that you have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.930" end="00:40:05.849" style="s2">capacity to be it you know the time the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.230" end="00:40:08.670" style="s2">emotional capacity the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.849" end="00:40:12.930" style="s2">capacity then that is the domain in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.670" end="00:40:16.530" style="s2">which which feels to me like the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.930" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">appropriate domain for action and I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.530" end="00:40:20.700" style="s2">that that that Angelo for instance could</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.200" end="00:40:23.849" style="s2">probably talk about this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.700" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">that what he&#39;s done in the last eight or</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.849" end="00:40:34.140" style="s2">so months has been precisely to to to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:36.660" style="s2">gather up other decisions and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.140" end="00:40:39.780" style="s2">changes that he knew he he needed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.660" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">make in order to affect what was most</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.780" end="00:40:48.410" style="s2">local to him to from what I can tell an</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:52.170" style="s2">edge pretty enormous positive effect and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.410" end="00:40:56.250" style="s2">if so I guess to end on a question there</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.170" end="00:40:59.339" style="s2">that I I think to invite people into</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.250" end="00:41:02.220" style="s2">that and even there&#39;s you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.339" end="00:41:04.890" style="s2">bit of JPM is to because it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.220" end="00:41:06.540" style="s2">since taking responsibility think and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.890" end="00:41:08.369" style="s2">cleaning your own room to an extent you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.540" end="00:41:13.050" style="s2">know is that because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.369" end="00:41:16.109" style="s2">what for a lot of people who are not in</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.050" end="00:41:21.150" style="s2">in the position that I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.109" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">where I&#39;ve got a degree I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.150" end="00:41:26.010" style="s2">lot of time but I&#39;ve got it I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:29.160" style="s2">degree of security that allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.010" end="00:41:31.830" style="s2">have these kinds of conversations which</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.160" end="00:41:34.770" style="s2">is extending beyond what others can I</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.830" end="00:41:37.080" style="s2">can necessarily do so just inviting them</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.770" end="00:41:39.240" style="s2">into like if this is my way if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.080" end="00:41:42.630" style="s2">beginning to act in that in that local</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.240" end="00:41:44.940" style="s2">one way to be able to able to gather a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.630" end="00:41:50.940" style="s2">bit of sovereignty that might not look</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.940" end="00:41:56.220" style="s2">the same for the next person but what</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.940" end="00:41:59.880" style="s2">are the mobilizing principles which</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.220" end="00:42:03.530" style="s2">which invite them into that and give</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.880" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">them some way to orient themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.530" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">you know I would suggested other</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.820" style="s2">princess Arnaz advice is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:12.180" style="s2">actually some of the best that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.820" end="00:42:15.099" style="s2">probably get do the next right thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.180" end="00:42:16.420" style="s2">yeah I underlined that in my little</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.099" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">notes here bore that I underlined</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.420" end="00:42:23.830" style="s2">everything else yeah awesome awesome</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:26.020" style="s2">well Angela I&#39;m interested to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.830" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">follow up from that because James did</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.020" end="00:42:32.020" style="s2">allude to to you here in acting in your</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:33.849" style="s2">local community in a way that involves</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.020" end="00:42:35.530" style="s2">many of these principles I personally</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.849" end="00:42:37.180" style="s2">love to hear the story of that if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.530" end="00:42:40.210" style="s2">don&#39;t mind sharing there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">else more resonant go ahead but please I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.210" end="00:42:46.030" style="s2">just think I want to I think James was</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:48.430" style="s2">talking about principles and just before</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.030" end="00:42:51.340" style="s2">anything else just my reaction to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.430" end="00:42:55.800" style="s2">is one of those is around a principle of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.340" end="00:42:58.450" style="s2">minimalism and not just in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.800" end="00:43:01.560" style="s2">popular sense of that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.450" end="00:43:06.220" style="s2">materiality or material things but just</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.560" end="00:43:10.180" style="s2">minimalism as a broader concept you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.220" end="00:43:16.450" style="s2">extending to know the monopolization of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:18.940" style="s2">your time in in any sense I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.450" end="00:43:22.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a real challenge but to be seeing</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.940" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">your time as being one of the most you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.780" end="00:43:30.130" style="s2">know highest value commodities</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:33.310" style="s2">that&#39;s not renewable and positioning</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.130" end="00:43:37.150" style="s2">yourself in a way that you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.310" end="00:43:38.950" style="s2">true to that and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.150" end="00:43:41.410" style="s2">definitely from it from a principles</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.950" end="00:43:43.950" style="s2">perspective I think one that&#39;s made a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.410" end="00:43:43.950" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.230" end="00:43:51.570" style="s2">there is there is no there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">turn time into a renewable resource oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:58.630" style="s2">and that being at the heart of an</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:44:00.910" style="s2">approach to minimalism I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.630" end="00:44:03.000" style="s2">interesting what it can do because in</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.910" end="00:44:07.660" style="s2">the end like the cleaning your room type</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.000" end="00:44:11.460" style="s2">analogy is really about creating the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.660" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">time it&#39;s about not having the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.460" end="00:44:16.690" style="s2">clutter mental or physical that gets in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:18.150" style="s2">the way of property to do maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.690" end="00:44:20.470" style="s2">something else that is more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.150" end="00:44:24.670" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a conversation like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.470" end="00:44:26.310" style="s2">whether it&#39;s some an opportunity to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.670" end="00:44:28.690" style="s2">know go fishing with your child or</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.310" end="00:44:31.060" style="s2">whatever that is factor that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.690" end="00:44:32.920" style="s2">that you can give yourself that time to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.060" end="00:44:34.660" style="s2">find what is more meaningful and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:38.530" style="s2">apply more of that really precious</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.660" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">resource on to it so I think that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.530" end="00:44:45.430" style="s2">thing that&#39;s been a real kind of clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:49.030" style="s2">yeah counterpoint to just kind of test</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.430" end="00:44:52.270" style="s2">you know how much of this is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.030" end="00:44:54.609" style="s2">scripted how much of this is just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.270" end="00:44:56.609" style="s2">rolling out another mental model or how</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.609" end="00:45:01.840" style="s2">much of this is really being driven by</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.609" end="00:45:04.990" style="s2">by me at the core so yeah so really</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.840" end="00:45:08.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really the driver work</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.990" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">less in terms of that monopolization</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.250" end="00:45:15.430" style="s2">again not everyone has that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:17.619" style="s2">but if you do I think it&#39;s um I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.430" end="00:45:20.170" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you you mayn&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.619" end="00:45:22.530" style="s2">you&#39;re being called to do that hearing</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.170" end="00:45:22.530" style="s2">the call</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.420" end="00:45:28.010" style="s2">and with a little bit of extra time not</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.789" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">a lot just a little bit of extra time</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.010" end="00:45:32.420" style="s2">and the opportunity to devote to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:34.579" style="s2">consideration of what is important to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.420" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">a lot of things can change really</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.579" end="00:45:41.150" style="s2">quickly but I think you know Arthur was</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:43.400" style="s2">saying it before you know the way things</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:46.490" style="s2">are set up and it&#39;s they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.400" end="00:45:50.630" style="s2">before about optimization and supply</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.490" end="00:45:53.380" style="s2">chains and no jobs and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.630" end="00:45:55.640" style="s2">that people devote a lot of time to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.380" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">they&#39;re really not set up to make it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.640" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">easy for people to to get back time</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.690" end="00:46:06.309" style="s2">but what&#39;s really interesting now is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.010" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">that there&#39;s a bit of a hybrid going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.309" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">that maybe the jobs that are essential</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">are continuing however they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">continuing in a in a very new</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:17.170" style="s2">environment an environment to me looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:18.869" style="s2">more closely like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.170" end="00:46:22.900" style="s2">environment that I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.869" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">generate for me and my family regardless</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.900" end="00:46:29.110" style="s2">of pandemics so people are at home</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:31.900" style="s2">people are surrounded by their children</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.110" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">or by their you know their friends or</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.900" end="00:46:38.170" style="s2">housemates pets no I&#39;m just really</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">interested to see what this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.170" end="00:46:44.020" style="s2">do what is post covert life going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:47.860" style="s2">look like and what I&#39;m really afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.020" end="00:46:49.420" style="s2">is are we not going to have taken the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.860" end="00:46:51.430" style="s2">advantage of maybe some time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.420" end="00:46:54.760" style="s2">given or new environment that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.430" end="00:46:58.930" style="s2">given to us in this situation to notice</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.760" end="00:47:00.850" style="s2">how valuable these opportunities are to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.930" end="00:47:04.630" style="s2">be in a different environment to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.850" end="00:47:07.120" style="s2">closer to your loved ones to you know to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.630" end="00:47:10.210" style="s2">soak up that joy of having a pet next to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.120" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">you all day my fear is more that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.210" end="00:47:14.740" style="s2">not going to we&#39;re not going to see that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:17.290" style="s2">it&#39;s being valuable enough that it means</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.740" end="00:47:21.640" style="s2">to be retained and it needs to become</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.290" end="00:47:24.850" style="s2">what we see is a default back to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.640" end="00:47:27.100" style="s2">rush rush rush around you know do our</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.850" end="00:47:31.360" style="s2">cycle of activity pay our empower</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.100" end="00:47:35.080" style="s2">mortgage and again the so the handcuffs</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.360" end="00:47:36.550" style="s2">are not not given them the time to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.080" end="00:47:39.070" style="s2">that opportunity for a circuit breaker</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.550" end="00:47:42.100" style="s2">so this is this potentially could be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.070" end="00:47:45.400" style="s2">huge circuit breaker for how our society</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.100" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">I guess identifies what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:52.510" style="s2">valuable and how we try to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:56.830" style="s2">postcode well that that honors the value</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.510" end="00:47:58.470" style="s2">of these things that are seemingly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.830" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">have value I think James talked about</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.470" end="00:48:05.210" style="s2">you know before that example of an of a</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.100" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">this stuff a person who works from home</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.930" end="00:48:28.490" style="s2">you know I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:32.120" style="s2">interesting for me now and again</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.490" end="00:48:34.280" style="s2">noticing trying to notice and fingers</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.120" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">and toes crossed that we don&#39;t get to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.280" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">point that we just go oh well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">over now let&#39;s go back to what was a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:44.750" style="s2">of life that I think was really</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.720" style="s2">constricting for people to have that</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.750" end="00:48:49.460" style="s2">opportunity to find to discuss what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.720" end="00:48:50.840" style="s2">valuable to find it for themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.460" end="00:48:57.350" style="s2">then make some changes so that their</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.840" end="00:49:00.220" style="s2">life becomes more about that um like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.350" end="00:49:03.590" style="s2">you really did a good job they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.220" end="00:49:07.510" style="s2">talking about the like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.590" end="00:49:07.510" style="s2">talking earlier about about the value</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.750" end="00:49:12.890" style="s2">because that&#39;s I guess at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">it that appears to be that the fear is</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.890" end="00:49:18.290" style="s2">that we will that we are given it we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:21.380" style="s2">being given in some sense a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.290" end="00:49:24.200" style="s2">maybe not equally and uniformly but a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.380" end="00:49:27.890" style="s2">lot of us hopefully enough of us being</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.200" end="00:49:29.960" style="s2">given a glimpse again as to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.890" end="00:49:31.790" style="s2">actually valuable and it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.960" end="00:49:33.290" style="s2">interesting to me that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.790" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">discussions that is playing out in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.290" end="00:49:39.230" style="s2">in the mainstream media is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:40.550" style="s2">discussion around you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.230" end="00:49:43.120" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be open and what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.550" end="00:49:47.360" style="s2">to be closed the question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.120" end="00:49:50.140" style="s2">essential and and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.360" end="00:49:54.560" style="s2">actually is a super pertinent question</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:57.800" style="s2">as people are going into their their you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.560" end="00:50:02.230" style="s2">know your their homes they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.800" end="00:50:06.050" style="s2">reminded of what is essential because</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.230" end="00:50:08.450" style="s2">you know one part of you is is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.050" end="00:50:12.860" style="s2">about well you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.450" end="00:50:14.210" style="s2">kind of a survival impulse that kicks in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.860" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">after when you got a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.210" end="00:50:17.380" style="s2">panic going on so that brings to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:23.140" style="s2">fore the question</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.380" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">around food medications and your your</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.140" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">your healthcare but what you you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:31.300" style="s2">or less comfortable than that is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:33.790" style="s2">evaporating too quickly or or to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.300" end="00:50:36.040" style="s2">destabilize then you begin to look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.790" end="00:50:37.750" style="s2">those those other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.040" end="00:50:40.630" style="s2">slightly higher up the Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.750" end="00:50:44.350" style="s2">hierarchy in terms of your relationships</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.630" end="00:50:50.890" style="s2">and your your well-being and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.350" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">given the opportunity now to be as as</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.890" end="00:50:55.780" style="s2">you say age with our you know with our</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">children like I&#39;m spending I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.780" end="00:51:00.370" style="s2">up early in order to work and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.770" style="s2">finishing early and I&#39;m getting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.370" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">afternoons with my children I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.770" end="00:51:07.390" style="s2">have that book before now that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:09.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not a luxury that everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.390" end="00:51:11.170" style="s2">necessarily but I know quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.100" end="00:51:13.330" style="s2">people who are experiencing that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.170" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not to say that that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.330" end="00:51:21.640" style="s2">always super easy that&#39;s actually taken</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">some some adjustment and it&#39;s made me</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.640" end="00:51:31.630" style="s2">realize that you know I&#39;ve had so little</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">time to do that that I almost don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.630" end="00:51:42.610" style="s2">practiced at making fun for my children</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:45.010" style="s2">and so when I see ads pop up on on</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.610" end="00:51:47.290" style="s2">Facebook or articles which are asking</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.010" end="00:51:51.160" style="s2">the question you know or which are</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.290" end="00:51:53.860" style="s2">putting putting forward articles about</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.160" end="00:51:57.580" style="s2">how to how to play with your kids</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.860" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">journey in lockdown and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.580" end="00:52:03.850" style="s2">is that making me feel sad about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:07.960" style="s2">state of that that that&#39;s even an</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.850" end="00:52:11.080" style="s2">article that has to be written there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.960" end="00:52:14.910" style="s2">this subpart of it in myself also that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.080" end="00:52:19.150" style="s2">I&#39;m disappointed that on that I have not</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.910" end="00:52:22.870" style="s2">been that I&#39;ve not been afforded or</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.150" end="00:52:25.990" style="s2">taken the opportunity previously to to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.870" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">really pay attention to that to really</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.990" end="00:52:29.380" style="s2">pay attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:33.400" style="s2">but now just in the last few days it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.380" end="00:52:35.980" style="s2">just been a whole new experience so just</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.400" end="00:52:38.710" style="s2">learning as I&#39;m as I&#39;m going along when</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.980" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">the richness that is he&#39;s developing</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.710" end="00:52:43.090" style="s2">it&#39;s still challenging sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:46.690" style="s2">know at 24 years old that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.090" end="00:52:50.260" style="s2">they do they challenge you but um but</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.690" end="00:52:55.210" style="s2">then the richness of experience that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.260" end="00:52:57.690" style="s2">having as an embodied experience that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.210" end="00:53:00.280" style="s2">could have I could hypothesize about</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.690" end="00:53:04.750" style="s2">previously but I didn&#39;t have it to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.280" end="00:53:09.700" style="s2">able to say it with with conviction now</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.750" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got I think you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.700" end="00:53:15.600" style="s2">positive implications of this of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:18.910" style="s2">Osbourne situation is a whole population</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.600" end="00:53:22.270" style="s2">a large percentage of which hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.910" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">will have a similar experience yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.270" end="00:53:29.110" style="s2">going to be trying and all of that but</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:31.780" style="s2">maybe with enough space enough my</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.110" end="00:53:33.430" style="s2">stillness and time to be able to work</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.780" end="00:53:35.800" style="s2">our way into that to be able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.430" end="00:53:39.400" style="s2">ourselves into that then that creates an</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.800" end="00:53:42.130" style="s2">embodied experience which you actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.400" end="00:53:44.560" style="s2">like people are kind of throwing out the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.130" end="00:53:47.350" style="s2">hash tag I like don&#39;t go back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.560" end="00:53:49.000" style="s2">I think it&#39;s it feels like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.350" end="00:53:51.430" style="s2">possibility that that&#39;s almost going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.000" end="00:53:53.980" style="s2">be always going to be redundant in terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.430" end="00:53:58.420" style="s2">of it being so imbued in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.980" end="00:53:59.860" style="s2">consciousness that that arm the hash tag</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.420" end="00:54:03.850" style="s2">would be too obvious to even put out</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.860" end="00:54:07.390" style="s2">there that&#39;s a hope anyway I know I</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.850" end="00:54:09.670" style="s2">acknowledged that it&#39;s not all roses for</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.390" end="00:54:11.770" style="s2">for everybody there are some some</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.670" end="00:54:14.680" style="s2">downsides also for those households that</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.770" end="00:54:16.810" style="s2">there are you know have issues with</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.680" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">domestic violence and with abuse and all</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.810" end="00:54:22.330" style="s2">that kind of things so that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:24.520" style="s2">different kettle of fish maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:27.580" style="s2">enough of the positive to help us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.520" end="00:54:31.060" style="s2">make that shift hmm yeah beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.580" end="00:54:32.890" style="s2">said James and an Angelo before so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.060" end="00:54:35.910" style="s2">like to say something and then open up a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.890" end="00:54:39.640" style="s2">question that we can perhaps close on</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.910" end="00:54:41.530" style="s2">and I&#39;d be interested in if if Angelo</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.640" end="00:54:44.430" style="s2">what you&#39;ve sort of been working on low</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.530" end="00:54:46.810" style="s2">bears on this on this on the question</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.430" end="00:54:50.710" style="s2">but first the point I&#39;d like to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.810" end="00:54:52.869" style="s2">which is that following on from what</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.710" end="00:54:56.470" style="s2">you&#39;re referencing here James and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.869" end="00:54:59.109" style="s2">the the in response to the fear that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.470" end="00:55:01.180" style="s2">presence tangelo that what happens if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.109" end="00:55:04.180" style="s2">don&#39;t take the time to notice the value</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.180" end="00:55:07.930" style="s2">we&#39;re being offered to perceive in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.180" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">time and James with your examples of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.930" end="00:55:12.420" style="s2">value you are perceiving in this time</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:14.859" style="s2">this increased opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.420" end="00:55:17.380" style="s2">relationality with with people we care</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.859" end="00:55:20.349" style="s2">about where that is the case and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.380" end="00:55:26.290" style="s2">otherwise evaluate how essential what</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.349" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is and oh and importantly that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.290" end="00:55:33.430" style="s2">that if this lasts for long enough that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:36.250" style="s2">this presence this stillness can become</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.430" end="00:55:38.170" style="s2">an embodiment that did we can that this</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.250" end="00:55:40.599" style="s2">can inform our consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.170" end="00:55:42.070" style="s2">there&#39;s some transforms us in an</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.599" end="00:55:44.320" style="s2">important degree well I&#39;d like to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.070" end="00:55:45.790" style="s2">and and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.320" end="00:55:48.150" style="s2">right otherwise we will just go back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.790" end="00:55:52.300" style="s2">normal or worse or we have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.150" end="00:55:55.950" style="s2">certainly this is about learning and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.300" end="00:56:00.580" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to say is that it is these</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.950" end="00:56:02.020" style="s2">conversations not only not only but what</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.580" end="00:56:07.660" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in is connecting</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.020" end="00:56:09.250" style="s2">connecting the small world networks that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.660" end="00:56:11.320" style="s2">are maybe forming in the family these</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.250" end="00:56:12.010" style="s2">perceptions of stillness is what&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.320" end="00:56:15.190" style="s2">caring about</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.010" end="00:56:17.980" style="s2">and then to share that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.190" end="00:56:20.500" style="s2">with others it&#39;s in the intermeshing of</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.980" end="00:56:25.140" style="s2">that in the development of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.500" end="00:56:27.970" style="s2">embodiment that that&#39;s going to inform</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.140" end="00:56:30.310" style="s2">let that&#39;s a mechanism that I see as</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.970" end="00:56:32.500" style="s2">being something which can enable us to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.310" end="00:56:36.490" style="s2">come out of this whatever this is and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.500" end="00:56:38.530" style="s2">whatever out of it is with that wider</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.490" end="00:56:41.140" style="s2">sense of connectedness because a fear I</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.530" end="00:56:43.869" style="s2">have is that like so many things and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.140" end="00:56:49.510" style="s2">experience this so much in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.869" end="00:56:51.550" style="s2">sometimes is that you can be you know in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.510" end="00:56:53.410" style="s2">this and for those just listening you</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.550" end="00:56:55.510" style="s2">know I&#39;m making it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.410" end="00:56:58.810" style="s2">reference with my hands to just a sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.510" end="00:57:00.940" style="s2">of a tights fear you can be in a space</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.810" end="00:57:03.820" style="s2">you can inhabit a domain with someone</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.940" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">and it can be wonderful and then you</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.820" end="00:57:07.720" style="s2">might leave that and we&#39;ll where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:09.670" style="s2">continuity where&#39;s the continuity</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.720" end="00:57:11.770" style="s2">between that we&#39;re feeling now and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.670" end="00:57:13.360" style="s2">everyone else altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.770" end="00:57:15.910" style="s2">consciousness and the whole this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.360" end="00:57:18.580" style="s2">integration fundamentally how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.910" end="00:57:22.180" style="s2">integrate the what we are learning in</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.580" end="00:57:25.590" style="s2">this time to it within the collective so</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.180" end="00:57:27.670" style="s2">that the collective is itself and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.590" end="00:57:31.050" style="s2">becomes part of the network we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.670" end="00:57:34.140" style="s2">connecting nodes in the network here so</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.050" end="00:57:36.370" style="s2">that&#39;s why this call to action of to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.140" end="00:57:37.960" style="s2">participate in conversations like this</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.370" end="00:57:39.490" style="s2">is so important in this time and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.960" end="00:57:43.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that could be through whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.490" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">for whatever forum that is but in in</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.840" end="00:57:48.730" style="s2">sharing these stories and sharing these</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:51.310" style="s2">experiences in collaboratively</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.730" end="00:57:56.020" style="s2">resonating about what we are realizing</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.310" end="00:57:59.050" style="s2">is there to care about that is one way I</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.020" end="00:58:01.210" style="s2">think that we can be taking action now</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.050" end="00:58:04.660" style="s2">that is informing what we come out of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.210" end="00:58:08.620" style="s2">this with it is it is building that mesh</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.660" end="00:58:12.100" style="s2">of connections you know and and your</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.620" end="00:58:12.490" style="s2">piece in that sharing is necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.100" end="00:58:15.100" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.490" end="00:58:17.290" style="s2">it&#39;s truly necessary so this call for</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.100" end="00:58:20.200" style="s2">deep participation has been there for</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.290" end="00:58:23.470" style="s2">some time is now is now very much</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.200" end="00:58:25.450" style="s2">important now so the sharing of presents</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.470" end="00:58:28.090" style="s2">together you know this is what it comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.450" end="00:58:30.640" style="s2">down to being here now together having</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.090" end="00:58:33.610" style="s2">are here and now informed by the being</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.640" end="00:58:35.710" style="s2">of each other and that&#39;s the point I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.610" end="00:58:37.990" style="s2">like to make and and of course I invite</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.710" end="00:58:41.850" style="s2">either of you to just respond to that as</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.990" end="00:58:47.110" style="s2">it is but the question I had in mind is</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.850" end="00:58:51.430" style="s2">what have either of you learned in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.110" end="00:58:54.340" style="s2">taking actions locally in in reaching</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.430" end="00:58:57.010" style="s2">out and building community in in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.340" end="00:59:00.130" style="s2">Gippsland taking and taking the view of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.010" end="00:59:03.130" style="s2">how do we take responsibility for our</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.130" end="00:59:05.090" style="s2">community what has been learned in terms</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.130" end="00:59:07.790" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.090" end="00:59:10.460" style="s2">helps people step into that space of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.790" end="00:59:13.130" style="s2">building connectivity together in a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.460" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s I suppose related importantly to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.130" end="00:59:17.000" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get out here with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.170" style="s2">sharing of presence and and otherwise I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.000" end="00:59:21.370" style="s2">just want to say thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.170" end="00:59:21.370" style="s2">this wonderful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.490" end="00:59:28.550" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.100" end="00:59:48.100" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:53.500" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.430" end="01:00:11.390" style="s2">yeah oh I love what you&#39;re saying I</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.510" end="01:00:11.390" style="s2">thought I see it I can feel it</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.710" end="01:00:28.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.790" end="01:00:28.250" style="s2">some certainty in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.380" end="01:00:34.740" style="s2">what a coupe contributors options around</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.869" end="01:00:40.730" style="s2">that thoughts where there is a little</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.740" end="01:00:46.049" style="s2">bit more certainty or comfort for me is</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.730" end="01:00:49.670" style="s2">that without the local focus and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.049" end="01:00:54.140" style="s2">level of localness could be down to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.670" end="01:00:56.549" style="s2">individual the atomic view or the family</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.140" end="01:00:59.549" style="s2">your neighbor your neighborhood your</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.549" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">street whatever that is without the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.549" end="01:01:07.950" style="s2">focus on that for me first or not first</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:11.569" style="s2">as in sequentially but at least it needs</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.950" end="01:01:11.569" style="s2">to be where it begins</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.110" end="01:01:18.090" style="s2">even now that that&#39;s been something that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.790" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">I have been trying to do more so I still</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.090" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s giving me any kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.010" end="01:01:25.380" style="s2">of great insight into what&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:26.820" style="s2">potential for that further connection</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.380" end="01:01:29.670" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.820" end="01:01:33.960" style="s2">that expansion what was the word that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.670" end="01:01:37.610" style="s2">you used the integration I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.960" end="01:01:37.610" style="s2">still feel like I&#39;m struggling with that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.880" end="01:01:52.460" style="s2">we&#39;re on my</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.540" end="01:01:55.010" style="s2">way to kind of ask her a related</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.460" end="01:01:58.490" style="s2">question is like how does how does</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.010" end="01:02:01.550" style="s2">community build how does it does the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.490" end="01:02:05.330" style="s2">benefits Geographic or otherwise and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.550" end="01:02:09.700" style="s2">and I think that it is I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.330" end="01:02:09.700" style="s2">I&#39;d like on having having difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.980" end="01:02:16.940" style="s2">coming up with a really coherent answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.930" end="01:02:21.860" style="s2">to that question I don&#39;t really know no</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.940" end="01:02:25.220" style="s2">but I have some intuition I guess that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.860" end="01:02:27.770" style="s2">that that question around how does one</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.220" end="01:02:31.610" style="s2">actually actually build community give</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.770" end="01:02:36.020" style="s2">us gives maybe some some direction</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.610" end="01:02:42.170" style="s2">insofar as the the answer to that for me</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.020" end="01:02:49.130" style="s2">is is really with Ajax and with H with H</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.170" end="01:02:51.770" style="s2">engagement and and so I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.130" end="01:02:53.390" style="s2">about how there are different types of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.770" end="01:02:54.620" style="s2">people who might be only listening or</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.390" end="01:02:56.810" style="s2">who might join these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.620" end="01:03:03.890" style="s2">conversations in the future and gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.810" end="01:03:07.700" style="s2">have differing appetites for the meta</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.890" end="01:03:09.470" style="s2">framing my conversation and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.700" end="01:03:14.090" style="s2">gonna have have different appetites for</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.470" end="01:03:18.320" style="s2">the super project-oriented down in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.090" end="01:03:19.490" style="s2">in the in the grassroots action based v</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.320" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;s going to be that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.490" end="01:03:28.730" style="s2">whole whole spectrum and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:32.030" style="s2">that that idea of just being able to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.730" end="01:03:35.960" style="s2">what it is within your world that is he</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.030" end="01:03:40.430" style="s2">so he&#39;s most immediate and that his most</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.960" end="01:03:44.690" style="s2">his most needed he&#39;s actually a way to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.430" end="01:03:47.060" style="s2">build to build community and for and for</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.690" end="01:03:51.670" style="s2">for me just to give one I give one</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.060" end="01:03:51.670" style="s2">concrete example of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.670" end="01:03:57.180" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;ve done in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.770" end="01:04:02.880" style="s2">last couple of weeks is to put together</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.180" end="01:04:05.940" style="s2">a group like like private Facebook group</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.880" end="01:04:09.090" style="s2">just for just for those of mine in in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.940" end="01:04:10.680" style="s2">Street and it hasn&#39;t been a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.090" end="01:04:13.470" style="s2">activity on it yet and there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.680" end="01:04:16.320" style="s2">varying levels of enthusiasm and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.470" end="01:04:18.570" style="s2">interestingly even one even I mean one</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.320" end="01:04:22.500" style="s2">neighbor that I approached a few doors</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.570" end="01:04:24.930" style="s2">up had kind of said ah you know I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.500" end="01:04:27.810" style="s2">thanks alright I&#39;m good I&#39;ve got our</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.930" end="01:04:30.360" style="s2">networks like I came well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.810" end="01:04:34.920" style="s2">obviously not not salient for them so so</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.360" end="01:04:37.590" style="s2">move on and and what I guess what what</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.920" end="01:04:43.320" style="s2">we were hoping for there was to at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.590" end="01:04:45.810" style="s2">establish the possibility of new</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.320" end="01:04:49.200" style="s2">connections which we we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.810" end="01:04:51.360" style="s2">our situation is as neighbors is going</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.200" end="01:04:55.170" style="s2">to be in the next three months or six</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.360" end="01:04:56.850" style="s2">months and at the moment I think people</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.170" end="01:04:59.190" style="s2">are kind of like oh yeah that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.850" end="01:05:03.120" style="s2">a cool idea not really super needed</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.190" end="01:05:06.810" style="s2">right now but cool idea let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.120" end="01:05:12.450" style="s2">let&#39;s see where it goes so that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.810" end="01:05:18.410" style="s2">pre-empting a potential need and another</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.450" end="01:05:18.410" style="s2">one is as simple as the kinds of local</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.620" end="01:05:25.620" style="s2">local acts that are taking place to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.730" end="01:05:27.930" style="s2">support critical businesses and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.620" end="01:05:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not the project itself like for</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.930" end="01:05:32.700" style="s2">instance the other local Gazette the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.080" end="01:05:35.040" style="s2">newspaper which has been around for 110</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.700" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">you know years or so is having a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.040" end="01:05:38.610" style="s2">hard time because obviously obviously</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:40.440" style="s2">businesses are closing there therefore</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.610" end="01:05:42.750" style="s2">not advertising why would they advertise</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.440" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">if they&#39;re closing therefore because</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.750" end="01:05:50.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not making the money it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:52.800" style="s2">continue going now from a purely a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.060" end="01:05:54.600" style="s2">utilitarian point of view you could say</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.800" end="01:05:57.120" style="s2">well that&#39;s a good thing to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.600" end="01:05:58.710" style="s2">its supporting that that institution</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.120" end="01:06:01.109" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.710" end="01:06:04.500" style="s2">what part of our local media okay fine</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.109" end="01:06:06.000" style="s2">but but the corollary of doing that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.500" end="01:06:09.150" style="s2">actually what&#39;s really interesting for</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.000" end="01:06:11.640" style="s2">me in that once you begin to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.150" end="01:06:13.109" style="s2">that with others in your community like</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.640" end="01:06:15.660" style="s2">I&#39;m meeting new people that I have not</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.109" end="01:06:17.700" style="s2">have not met in my community before I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.660" end="01:06:21.810" style="s2">forming new relationships that were not</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.700" end="01:06:28.260" style="s2">there I&#39;m strengthening it existing ones</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.810" end="01:06:30.210" style="s2">all through pretty small it in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.260" end="01:06:33.570" style="s2">perhaps on a grand scale they&#39;re trivial</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.210" end="01:06:35.460" style="s2">acts on a local local scale they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.570" end="01:06:40.470" style="s2">they may actually be really significant</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.460" end="01:06:44.460" style="s2">and so I hope through each act of an</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.470" end="01:06:48.290" style="s2">attempt to to strengthen that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.460" end="01:06:51.480" style="s2">community for our mutual support that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.290" end="01:06:54.450" style="s2">that we are able to invite people</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.480" end="01:06:57.000" style="s2">increasingly into a space where they</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.450" end="01:07:00.270" style="s2">understand what is essential what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.000" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">valued and and that they don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.270" end="01:07:06.270" style="s2">engage in them in in the meta</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:10.680" style="s2">conversation you can it&#39;s fun too but</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.270" end="01:07:12.750" style="s2">but they don&#39;t need to so so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.680" end="01:07:16.020" style="s2">thinking it like it&#39;s essential for me</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.750" end="01:07:19.740" style="s2">to engage in that I feel I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.020" end="01:07:22.589" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like in my bones but but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.740" end="01:07:25.050" style="s2">I am but I know it&#39;s not for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.589" end="01:07:28.830" style="s2">so I&#39;m thinking about how to make that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.050" end="01:07:33.560" style="s2">conversation irrelevant to everybody or</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:33.560" style="s2">how that unfolds at scale if you like</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.650" end="01:07:39.690" style="s2">yeah anyway it&#39;s it sounds parochial got</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.490" end="01:07:44.730" style="s2">actually in joking I&#39;ve been joking</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.690" end="01:07:47.640" style="s2">around with the term neo parochialism</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.730" end="01:07:50.369" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of like a its</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.640" end="01:07:54.270" style="s2">operating on on the principle that well</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.369" end="01:07:56.760" style="s2">if there is rot right action at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.270" end="01:08:00.410" style="s2">local scale toward your community</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.760" end="01:08:04.710" style="s2">towards your your ecology your family</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.410" end="01:08:06.750" style="s2">then if it&#39;s truly you know what I what</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.710" end="01:08:10.080" style="s2">Daniel schmuck Dan burger would call</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.750" end="01:08:10.780" style="s2">Omni considerate if it&#39;s truly Omni</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.080" end="01:08:14.140" style="s2">considerate</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.780" end="01:08:17.350" style="s2">right action then it&#39;s not only good for</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.140" end="01:08:23.020" style="s2">only good for your community and your</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.350" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">ecology it&#39;s actually good for a lot so</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.020" end="01:08:27.969" style="s2">yeah I I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been toying around</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">with that one lately just as a as a way</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.969" end="01:08:32.200" style="s2">to frame this kind of it&#39;s kind of my</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:34.210" style="s2">said it is parochial in some sense that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.200" end="01:08:37.080" style="s2">it&#39;s narrowly focused but it&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.210" end="01:08:40.029" style="s2">point of agency it&#39;s for the point of</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.080" end="01:08:42.700" style="s2">being able to do what you can do within</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.029" end="01:08:47.140" style="s2">your capacity and do it and do it</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.700" end="01:08:50.500" style="s2">powerfully and with humility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.140" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">so beautiful James know thyself be</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.500" end="01:09:00.460" style="s2">thyself take the next right action yeah</p>

<p begin="01:09:14.980" end="01:09:21.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting over</p>
