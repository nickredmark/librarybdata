<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">but read the new one rebooting AI first</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.610" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">here he&#39;s also a cognitive psychologist</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">he attended Hampshire College as did an</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">going on up there they taught us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">speak truth to power at Hampshire</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">College and that&#39;s what Lee and I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">in common we are both going after some</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">very popular views and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">don&#39;t like that but we speak the truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">as we see it I like that I can see</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">exactly that that template is the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">both you and Lee are challenging the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">conventional wisdom in a major way and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">neither of us are afraid to do it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t win us a lot of friends in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">certain quarters but you know science</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:12.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t progress by people being chummy</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">with each other it progresses by</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.349" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">recognizing limitation</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:18.600" style="s2">and taking the next step absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:20.130" style="s2">significant part of your new book is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.600" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">attempt to be more cautious and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.130" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">realistic about the short-term prospect</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">for AI without denying its long-term</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:30.350" style="s2">potential on what I might call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">oversold side you lay out a three-part</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.350" end="00:02:34.320" style="s2">description of what you think a big part</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:36.090" style="s2">of the problem is you call it the AI</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">chasm could you take us through that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.090" end="00:02:40.020" style="s2">well and there are multiple parts to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">but I think we could start with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.020" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">gullibility gap so the gullibility gap</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">is that we are very prone to seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">small signals of intelligent behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:51.270" style="s2">if there&#39;s more intelligence there than</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">there really is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.270" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">so classic example is Eliza which was</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">just a dumb keyword matching thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:02:59.910" style="s2">people would talk to as if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">psychiatrist and some people thought it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.910" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">was really a psychiatrist so it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">match things you would say I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">trouble with my girlfriend and it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">say well tell me about your family and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:11.550" style="s2">people thought that was really smart but</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:12.660" style="s2">it didn&#39;t actually know what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.550" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">girlfriend was it didn&#39;t know what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.660" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">relationship was it didn&#39;t know what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">family was it was just parroting those</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">things back it might as well have been a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">parrot and lots of people thought that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">it was smart so they&#39;re gullible they</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">see a small sample of what looks like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">intelligence our brains didn&#39;t evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:29.450" style="s2">say hey that person&#39;s intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">that&#39;s really just a machine and just</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.450" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">get suckered in another example that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">there was a guy who was so trusting of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">his Tesla after to driven him around for</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">a few hours a few days or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">was that he thought it&#39;d be okay to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">watch Harry Potter in the back and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">we all know what happened to that person</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">right they watched Harry Potter while</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:50.730" style="s2">their car drove for them and it ran into</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:53.549" style="s2">a trailer that took a left turn on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.730" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">highway and the person was killed so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.549" end="00:03:56.940" style="s2">know it can be really dangerous to trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:04:00.870" style="s2">machines too much but we have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.940" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">tendency to do that so the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.870" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">that we talked about is the illusory</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">progress gap you see a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">progress on some piece of a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">you think that that means that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">solved the whole problem so you get some</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">system that does a tiny bit of language</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">like it recognizes your request to turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">off the lights Alexa turn off their</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:21.930" style="s2">lights and you suddenly think well AI</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:23.940" style="s2">has solved the understanding problem or</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.930" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">you get a system that can interpret a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.940" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">few of our requests on Google and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">think that Google must understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:29.319" style="s2">natural language</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:31.000" style="s2">of course google doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.319" end="00:04:32.860" style="s2">natural language it understands a small</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.000" end="00:04:34.690" style="s2">fragment of natural language but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.860" end="00:04:36.699" style="s2">very easy to fool it and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.690" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">actually go and integrate all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.699" end="00:04:40.180" style="s2">information from the web it can just put</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">together a bunch of webpages that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:44.830" style="s2">matching keywords or use synonyms for</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:46.300" style="s2">your keywords and things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.830" end="00:04:47.349" style="s2">just because Google can do a piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.300" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.349" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">conversation with it so we&#39;re very prone</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:54.970" style="s2">to seeing small steps as if they mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:57.430" style="s2">more than they are the truth is that AI</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:04:59.379" style="s2">is really really hard we&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.430" end="00:05:01.960" style="s2">on it for 60 years and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.379" end="00:05:03.789" style="s2">machines that understand the world that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.960" end="00:05:05.409" style="s2">can build what I would call a discourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.789" end="00:05:07.449" style="s2">representation of the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.409" end="00:05:09.819" style="s2">talking about and interpret that it just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.449" end="00:05:11.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist yet and yet people write</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.819" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">newspapers and stories as if you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.949" end="00:05:16.169" style="s2">this latest little bit of progress was</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:18.610" style="s2">huge progress another example was</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.169" end="00:05:20.229" style="s2">Microsoft beat this thing called squad</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">or you could argue about whether it be</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.229" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">but we&#39;ll say for president purpose is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.889" style="s2">beat squad which was a test of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:28.780" style="s2">underlining text as you read passages</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.889" end="00:05:30.909" style="s2">and that sounds a bit like reading in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.780" end="00:05:32.169" style="s2">fact it involves a bit of reading but</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.909" end="00:05:34.270" style="s2">just because you can read what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.169" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">underlined able in the text doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.270" end="00:05:37.569" style="s2">that you can make inferences that&#39;s them</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:40.210" style="s2">beyond what&#39;s written even though those</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.569" end="00:05:42.219" style="s2">are obvious to any person and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.210" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">media accounts were like humans are</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.219" end="00:05:45.639" style="s2">going to be replaced by robots because</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.490" end="00:06:31.599" style="s2">things like if you&#39;re recommending books</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.229" end="00:06:33.279" style="s2">and you like my guitar zero book and you</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.279" end="00:06:37.300" style="s2">sorry and you wasted a little money but</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:39.940" style="s2">nobody dies but if you have a driverless</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.130" end="00:06:48.100" style="s2">out there that work a little bit I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">just having an argument on Twitter with</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.330" end="00:06:56.020" style="s2">and seventy-five percent right well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.830" end="00:06:57.010" style="s2">idiotic to use a system that is 75</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.090" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">right and if you&#39;re only 75 percent</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:03.640" style="s2">right you&#39;re not really that robust and</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.220" end="00:07:11.380" style="s2">coin yeah the robustness question is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.920" end="00:07:13.810" style="s2">that obviously hugely important and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.380" end="00:07:16.390" style="s2">speaks to you know what I think within</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.790" end="00:07:26.740" style="s2">this up and it&#39;s useful to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.500" end="00:07:28.690" style="s2">that the number of miles you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.740" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">drive to kill somebody with a human</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.690" end="00:07:32.230" style="s2">driver and that includes a drunk one a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:34.360" style="s2">sleeping one and that one just had an</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.230" end="00:07:36.910" style="s2">argument with its girlfriend is 10</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.360" end="00:07:39.190" style="s2">million miles I think the average is one</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.910" end="00:07:40.990" style="s2">in 134 million is the average I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.190" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2">course it can happen your first day of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:45.820" style="s2">driving but I think it&#39;s on average 130</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.300" end="00:07:48.340" style="s2">K but even if it were 10 million 110</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.820" end="00:07:50.680" style="s2">million it would still be much much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.340" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">reliable than your smartest driverless</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.680" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">car which was probably away mo you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:56.740" style="s2">looking the published statistics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:58.360" style="s2">what those statistics say is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.740" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">driverless cars need an intervention</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.360" end="00:08:03.160" style="s2">about 1 in every 10,000 miles that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">know many orders of magnitude away from</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.160" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">the human safety statistic for fatality</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:11.260" style="s2">yeah I remember the time I looked this</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:13.060" style="s2">up the total number of miles by way mo</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.260" end="00:08:14.770" style="s2">was less than 10 million all right say</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.060" end="00:08:17.080" style="s2">go okay no wonder hadn&#39;t killed anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.770" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">right to your anything a you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.080" end="00:08:21.070" style="s2">good second point which is we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">have the right number of miles to even</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.070" end="00:08:25.260" style="s2">begin to think that we&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:28.600" style="s2">reliability so if you had a million</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.260" end="00:08:30.340" style="s2">accident-free miles that still wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.600" end="00:08:31.990" style="s2">really be anywhere near enough big</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.340" end="00:08:33.729" style="s2">enough sample to establish with</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.979" end="00:08:40.450" style="s2">second point which is the reality is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">that these cars need human help every</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.450" end="00:08:45.750" style="s2">10,000 mile or on average ones in 10,000</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.960" end="00:08:53.950" style="s2">up to point a take you to point B the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.300" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">way that uber works</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:08:58.300" style="s2">so you know people sometimes like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">make fun of over goober drivers but</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.300" end="00:09:04.300" style="s2">human drivers are way safer way more</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:07.090" style="s2">reliable require Laila less help human</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.300" end="00:09:09.070" style="s2">driven uber cars then then do you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.090" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">your average human I mean definitely I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.070" end="00:09:13.150" style="s2">have a driverless car excuse me I did a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">quick look up and we were both wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.150" end="00:09:19.180" style="s2">about the the actual human kill rate</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:20.920" style="s2">which is 1.25 deaths per 100 million</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.180" end="00:09:23.830" style="s2">vehicle miles so that would be what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.920" end="00:09:26.220" style="s2">about one in every 75 million miles</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.830" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">something like that so but it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.220" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">probably still a bigger number than all</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">the miles driven by all the self-driving</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:34.960" style="s2">cars you will send me a link because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">have seen other numbers yeah this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.960" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">from the whoops it&#39;s from Wikipedia</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:10:01.540" style="s2">not under human intervention amounts to</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.910" style="s2">all the water is out you should have</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:40.440" style="s2">roughly zero but it says roughly in one</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.910" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">example two hundred gallons of water</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.250" end="00:12:56.340" style="s2">funny but it doesn&#39;t show that the</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:06.510" style="s2">this sort that&#39;s frankly what I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:09.510" style="s2">expect from something like deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.510" end="00:13:11.580" style="s2">which is essentially a very large</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.030" end="00:13:25.500" style="s2">your last point a step to artificial</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.190" end="00:13:27.210" style="s2">intelligence is you see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.500" end="00:13:29.370" style="s2">in the world with your sensors which</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.210" end="00:13:31.170" style="s2">might be cameras or people type things</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.370" end="00:13:33.330" style="s2">in or whatever and what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.170" end="00:13:36.420" style="s2">do is to build a model of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.330" end="00:13:37.830" style="s2">on right now so your listeners for</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.420" end="00:13:39.090" style="s2">example have a model that we have two</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.830" end="00:13:41.250" style="s2">people that are talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.090" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">may not know exactly where they are but</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:45.060" style="s2">you can if you&#39;re a listener you in your</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:46.470" style="s2">model for example think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.060" end="00:13:47.730" style="s2">both English speakers that both</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.470" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">knowledgeable about machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.730" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">they&#39;re both opinionated and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.570" style="s2">building up some view of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.100" style="s2">and then you use that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.570" end="00:13:59.550" style="s2">interpret the next thing that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.100" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">well that cumulative process the model</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.550" end="00:14:03.150" style="s2">building process is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:04.350" style="s2">fundamental things that AI just hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.150" end="00:14:06.210" style="s2">solved yet and deep learning in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.350" end="00:14:08.610" style="s2">particular doesn&#39;t really solve so it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.210" end="00:14:10.500" style="s2">evades it by having large amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.610" end="00:14:11.910" style="s2">statistics and sometimes that tricks</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:13.620" style="s2">people but that also leads to the lack</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.910" end="00:14:16.200" style="s2">of robustness that we&#39;re talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.620" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">would argue you can&#39;t possibly get to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">eight general intelligence if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.600" end="00:14:22.950" style="s2">have that process of cumulative model</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:25.200" style="s2">building as one of the core things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.950" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">you do yeah that seems very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.200" end="00:14:30.930" style="s2">to me it seems reasonable to you but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:32.820" style="s2">it&#39;s been very hard for me to get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.930" end="00:14:34.740" style="s2">field to engage in that so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.820" end="00:14:36.270" style="s2">lot of people that are working on deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.740" end="00:14:37.530" style="s2">learning they&#39;re extremely well-paid</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.270" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">they&#39;re excited about what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.530" end="00:14:42.390" style="s2">and they&#39;re not really familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">literature on cognitive psychology which</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.390" end="00:14:47.550" style="s2">a lot of which is about cognitive model</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:49.500" style="s2">building and people just don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.550" end="00:14:50.820" style="s2">appreciate at that point so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.500" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">geoff hinton is saying you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.820" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">listen to Gary Marcus because he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">that neural networks don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">but look at Google Translate it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">understands and the thing is that Google</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:02.850" style="s2">Translate does not have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:04.620" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on it does</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.850" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">not build up the kind of model that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.620" end="00:15:08.670" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about so you could feed it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:10.290" style="s2">in a passage from Harry Potter it might</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.670" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">translate it by looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.290" end="00:15:14.250" style="s2">statistics of how this phrase connects</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:15.930" style="s2">to this other phrase but if you asked it</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.250" end="00:15:17.850" style="s2">at the end what happened in this scene</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.930" end="00:15:20.430" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t know where to start because</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.850" end="00:15:22.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not building up an interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.430" end="00:15:23.940" style="s2">of you know this person wound up in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.350" end="00:15:26.580" style="s2">room and they had a magic wand or</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.940" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">whatever it is that they did it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.580" end="00:15:31.950" style="s2">kind of like like china the old Searle</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.300" style="s2">Chinese room thing it&#39;s just matching</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.950" end="00:15:35.910" style="s2">little pieces together it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.300" end="00:15:38.100" style="s2">constructing these cumulative models of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.910" end="00:15:39.209" style="s2">the narrative that it&#39;s interpreting in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.100" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">just the way that we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.209" end="00:15:44.070" style="s2">and the field does not want to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">that issue and so it&#39;s kind of a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.070" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">bit delusional about how much progress</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">it goes back to the illusory progress</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:51.420" style="s2">thing just because you can do machine</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:54.170" style="s2">translation doesn&#39;t mean that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.420" end="00:15:57.329" style="s2">system that can interpret a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.170" end="00:15:59.339" style="s2">yet probably why it seems reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.329" end="00:16:01.260" style="s2">me is since 2014</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.339" end="00:16:03.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.260" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">reading the cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.390" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience literature and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.420" style="s2">particularly focusing on the</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.420" end="00:16:14.519" style="s2">cognition so I have you know a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:17.880" style="s2">relatively rich understanding of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.519" end="00:16:19.709" style="s2">things and I use that as my existence</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.709" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">compare other approaches to that so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.450" end="00:16:26.190" style="s2">can see whether it falls short as an</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.700" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">example people in the deep learning side</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.190" end="00:16:31.200" style="s2">who are so insistent on deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:33.060" style="s2">uber alles I had a chat one time with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.200" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">guy named Jurgen Schmidt Huber who I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.790" end="00:16:42.329" style="s2">was Turing complete and then brushed</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.329" end="00:16:47.250" style="s2">during complete yeah sometimes I feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.579" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">like people in the field understand math</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.250" end="00:16:51.180" style="s2">a lot better than they do psychology</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.860" style="s2">but like the models that they make</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.910" end="00:17:40.190" style="s2">they&#39;re narrow in a certain way I think</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.790" end="00:17:48.590" style="s2">the math side which many of them are I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.740" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">say that a rich understanding of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.730" end="00:17:59.900" style="s2">particularly one of my very favorite</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.980" end="00:18:02.030" style="s2">results is the no free lunch there</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.900" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">yeah which basically states that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.030" end="00:18:07.640" style="s2">is no best way to solve any problem or</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:09.020" style="s2">to search any database and that any such</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:10.820" style="s2">general statement ought to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.820" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">domain in question so that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.800" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">response so this is this technique is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.310" style="s2">the answer period I say such things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.320" style="s2">at empirical question let&#39;s see how they</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.310" end="00:18:23.030" style="s2">work in specific domains right just to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.320" end="00:18:24.890" style="s2">rephrase that no free lunch theorem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.030" end="00:18:26.390" style="s2">really that there&#39;s no one technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.890" end="00:18:27.860" style="s2">that is gonna be general across all</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.390" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">problems so you may have a specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.860" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">problem where there is a best technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">but there isn&#39;t no it is provable by</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:35.450" style="s2">that theorem that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:37.640" style="s2">that there&#39;s not a universal technique</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.450" end="00:18:38.690" style="s2">and so when a Shamir tuber or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.640" end="00:18:40.250" style="s2">like that says well I&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.690" end="00:18:42.380" style="s2">universal technique you should keep your</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.250" end="00:18:43.460" style="s2">hand on your wallet and realize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.380" end="00:18:45.080" style="s2">actually going to be good for some</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.460" end="00:18:47.330" style="s2">problems and not others what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.080" end="00:18:48.920" style="s2">interesting about human biology is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.330" end="00:18:50.660" style="s2">we have a lot of different mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.920" end="00:18:53.120" style="s2">for solving many different problems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.660" end="00:18:55.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten over evolutionary time some</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.120" end="00:18:56.330" style="s2">of them are you know pretty good and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.100" end="00:18:58.420" style="s2">some of them have problems and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.330" end="00:19:00.410" style="s2">but we have many different techniques so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.420" end="00:19:03.710" style="s2">observational learning for example is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.410" end="00:19:07.850" style="s2">not the same thing as learning language</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.710" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">or as you know calibrating what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.850" end="00:19:12.470" style="s2">gonna do with your hands as you catch a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:13.970" style="s2">tennis ball yeah so the we actually use</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.470" end="00:19:16.220" style="s2">multiple techniques there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.970" end="00:19:17.930" style="s2">one-size-fits-all as you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.220" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a long tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.930" end="00:19:21.380" style="s2">intellectual history of people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:23.690" style="s2">overreaching in that way so for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:25.730" style="s2">behaviorism try to capture all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.690" end="00:19:27.680" style="s2">psychology in a single set of equations</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.730" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">and you know some of what it said is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.680" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">true like we&#39;re all motivated by reward</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">but the fact that we&#39;re motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:35.180" style="s2">reward doesn&#39;t give you any of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:37.100" style="s2">nuance for example about how we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.180" end="00:19:39.020" style="s2">physical reasoning to understand whether</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.100" end="00:19:40.760" style="s2">something&#39;s gonna tip over you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.020" end="00:19:42.740" style="s2">absolutely right there is for many</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.760" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">people a tendency towards looking for</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.740" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">one answer and in fact why I often say</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:49.730" style="s2">that I when i once i get to know</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:50.309" style="s2">somebody of some intellectual depth in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.730" end="00:19:52.409" style="s2">the side</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.309" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">I make a determination do they</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.409" end="00:19:56.669" style="s2">understand the no free lunch theorem or</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:59.190" style="s2">don&#39;t they and I would say it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.669" end="00:20:01.619" style="s2">seventy-five percent they do not</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.190" end="00:20:04.830" style="s2">yeah well the related point I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.619" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">you I think it&#39;s a good litmus test the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.830" end="00:20:09.450" style="s2">the related point is if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">it then you tend not to appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.450" end="00:20:13.229" style="s2">value of nativism so everybody</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:15.599" style="s2">appreciates that learning is part of how</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.229" end="00:20:18.239" style="s2">we get to be who we are and we acquire a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.599" end="00:20:20.279" style="s2">lot of information from culture but one</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.239" end="00:20:22.889" style="s2">implication of no free lunch theorem is</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.279" end="00:20:25.229" style="s2">that having innate priors for particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.889" end="00:20:26.339" style="s2">kinds of problems innate knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.229" end="00:20:27.869" style="s2">particular kinds of problems can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.339" end="00:20:29.849" style="s2">really helpful so if you were not born</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.869" end="00:20:31.710" style="s2">knowing that there were persisting</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.849" end="00:20:33.719" style="s2">objects in the world and you just had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.710" end="00:20:35.639" style="s2">lot of kind of sense perception it would</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.719" end="00:20:37.289" style="s2">take a long time to figure out from all</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.639" end="00:20:39.989" style="s2">those correlations that objects are even</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.289" end="00:20:41.879" style="s2">things to look at and so people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.989" end="00:20:43.169" style="s2">really appreciate the no free lunch</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.879" end="00:20:45.419" style="s2">theorem I think are often much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.169" end="00:20:47.279" style="s2">receptive to there being some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.419" end="00:20:49.830" style="s2">nativism in biology and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.279" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">that AI is not gonna proceed until we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.830" end="00:20:54.119" style="s2">similarly allow some and eat us in there</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.279" style="s2">and a lot of people don&#39;t want it I know</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.119" end="00:20:58.859" style="s2">that&#39;s very weird they think that from</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.279" end="00:21:01.379" style="s2">very basic first principles we can solve</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.859" end="00:21:03.089" style="s2">the world and maybe they can but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.379" end="00:21:04.889" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be the way it&#39;s been saw</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.089" end="00:21:07.499" style="s2">previously I like the example you give</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.889" end="00:21:09.089" style="s2">actually if objects object your core to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.499" end="00:21:11.309" style="s2">the work I do on the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.089" end="00:21:13.469" style="s2">between attention and consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.309" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">from my bigging around the literature it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.469" end="00:21:18.239" style="s2">seems clear to me that objects are</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:20.099" style="s2">pretty damn innate right you cannot look</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.239" end="00:21:22.019" style="s2">at the world without having it chopped</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.099" end="00:21:24.839" style="s2">up into objects for you and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.019" end="00:21:27.119" style="s2">to happen at a very young age I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.839" end="00:21:29.489" style="s2">can&#39;t absolutely prove this but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.119" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">very very likely I like to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.489" end="00:21:34.259" style="s2">people humans don&#39;t like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:37.080" style="s2">humans have innate stuff in it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.259" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">strong bias my friend IRA&#39;s favorite is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.080" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">actually documented that empirically</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:42.359" style="s2">with some papers that are coming out</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.929" end="00:21:45.330" style="s2">so as lilac Lightman used to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.359" end="00:21:47.129" style="s2">empiricism is innate believing though we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.330" end="00:21:49.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything built-in is is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.129" end="00:21:50.969" style="s2">weird innate bit about human psychology</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.080" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">but if I show you a picture of a baby</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.969" end="00:21:54.419" style="s2">ibex climbing down the side of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.339" style="s2">mountain a few hours after its birth</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.419" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">there&#39;s just no coherent way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.339" end="00:22:00.419" style="s2">other than to think that that baby ibex</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:02.039" style="s2">already understands that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.419" end="00:22:03.370" style="s2">three-dimensional geometry to the world</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.370" end="00:22:07.210" style="s2">constituent parts of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.620" style="s2">it&#39;s traversing like you have to assume</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.210" end="00:22:10.510" style="s2">that or else you just can&#39;t explain what</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.620" end="00:22:12.910" style="s2">the behavior is you can&#39;t say that in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.510" end="00:22:15.040" style="s2">you know 180 minutes of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.910" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">the baby ibex has learned all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.040" end="00:22:17.770" style="s2">about objects in three-dimensional</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.810" end="00:24:17.530" style="s2">right when I was getting interested in</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.530" end="00:24:23.410" style="s2">and AGI I started to learn a new game</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.360" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">the ultimate game damn close to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.300" end="00:24:36.160" style="s2">huge it has every aspect it&#39;s got sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.690" style="s2">of rudimentary politics economics all</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.160" end="00:24:40.150" style="s2">kinds of different military units that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.690" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">you can mix and match they did a just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.150" end="00:24:45.400" style="s2">very rough calculation and decided that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">it had a branching rate per turn on the</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:52.420" style="s2">that to checkers which is three or four</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.110" end="00:24:54.940" style="s2">chests maybe thirty and go maybe to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.420" end="00:24:57.910" style="s2">fifty advanced tactics gold was ten to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.940" end="00:25:00.790" style="s2">the sixtieth so way higher search space</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.910" end="00:25:02.110" style="s2">than these other games and sure enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.790" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">when I played it the first time it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.110" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">kicked my butt really badly I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:09.550" style="s2">was humiliating the next three times it</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:11.530" style="s2">beat me easily then we had two games</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.550" end="00:25:13.480" style="s2">that were pretty good struggles and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.530" end="00:25:14.890" style="s2">game seven I beat it I&#39;ve never lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.480" end="00:25:17.980" style="s2">again I probably played it a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.890" end="00:25:19.660" style="s2">times and so mmm how could that be how</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.980" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">could I learn so quickly I went back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.660" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">looked at what was my knowledge base of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:27.040" style="s2">having been a war game player for fifty</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:30.510" style="s2">five years and I estimated that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.040" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">perhaps played 2500 games to completion</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.510" end="00:25:37.090" style="s2">across maybe 200 titles that&#39;s not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:39.910" style="s2">2500 games I&#39;d also perhaps read 200</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.090" end="00:25:42.130" style="s2">books on military history and strategy</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.910" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">so what seems like you know not a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.130" end="00:25:47.710" style="s2">lot of input you know 200 books is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">a few seconds a download today on a fast</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.710" end="00:25:51.880" style="s2">computer and 2500 games isn&#39;t very many</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.140" end="00:25:52.960" style="s2">but I was able to beat a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.880" end="00:25:55.420" style="s2">state-of-the-art</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.960" end="00:25:58.300" style="s2">10 to the 60th branching rate game after</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.420" end="00:26:00.670" style="s2">seven tries how did I do that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.300" end="00:26:03.730" style="s2">question has been nagging at me ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.670" end="00:26:05.770" style="s2">since and that&#39;s just a qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.730" end="00:26:08.140" style="s2">different approach than these brute</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.840" end="00:26:14.790" style="s2">playing but I would say that human</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.030" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">beings have a lot of concepts like</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:24.940" style="s2">of say splitting forces or flanking the</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.940" end="00:26:30.130" style="s2">are often very helpful or the what is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.490" end="00:26:31.050" style="s2">the OODA loop you know orient I forget</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:47.430" style="s2">definitely do you know the turns out</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.130" end="00:26:50.310" style="s2">that the basics of strategy and tactics</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.430" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">happen to work in this game and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.310" end="00:26:56.030" style="s2">induced strategy and tactics from</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:58.920" style="s2">playing 2500 games and reading 200 books</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.030" end="00:27:01.770" style="s2">which is relatively a small amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.920" end="00:27:04.170" style="s2">input to have been able to produce those</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.430" end="00:29:30.330" style="s2">like in a game that is a first-person</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">will happen but the current technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:35.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give us a way to accumulate</p>

<p begin="00:30:40.800" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">the next game over and again that limits</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.590" end="00:30:48.180" style="s2">you to games with relatively low</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.340" end="00:30:57.150" style="s2">but I read fair amount about it came</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.470" end="00:30:58.470" style="s2">away saying yeah it ought to work good</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.150" end="00:31:00.150" style="s2">but only within</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.190" end="00:31:05.610" style="s2">telling talk that I saw the other day</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.020" end="00:31:07.590" style="s2">and was by Petera Biel we were both</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.610" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">speaking at the Rotman Institute in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.590" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">Toronto and he&#39;s been one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">pioneers in deep learning for robots and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">he gave a very honest candid talk and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:17.909" style="s2">said here&#39;s the fundamental issue we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:21.150" style="s2">do all kind of crazy stuff in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.909" end="00:31:22.620" style="s2">like was in his lab but the rubik&#39;s cube</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.150" end="00:31:24.679" style="s2">stuff that people talked about recently</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.620" end="00:31:26.789" style="s2">was an extension of work that he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.679" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">part of the team that developed I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.789" end="00:31:31.620" style="s2">it was his students you know so you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">to remind you that rubik&#39;s cube the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.620" end="00:31:34.470" style="s2">system didn&#39;t actually learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:37.080" style="s2">solve a cube but it did learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.470" end="00:31:39.780" style="s2">the manipulation to turn the faces of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.080" end="00:31:41.220" style="s2">the cube and that&#39;s very exciting but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.780" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t see stuff like that in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">real world so people build laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:47.880" style="s2">demonstrations that rubik&#39;s cube had</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:50.100" style="s2">like sensors inside and you know it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.880" end="00:31:52.400" style="s2">a well-lit room or whatever you build a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.100" end="00:31:55.590" style="s2">robot to go into the real world and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.400" end="00:31:56.970" style="s2">things just don&#39;t work that well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.590" end="00:31:58.530" style="s2">okay maybe in a factory environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.970" end="00:32:00.840" style="s2">where things are very very well</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.530" end="00:32:02.789" style="s2">controlled but more open that ended the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.840" end="00:32:04.890" style="s2">world is which is related to your notion</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.789" end="00:32:07.650" style="s2">of branching factor it&#39;s not identical</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.890" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">to but related to it the more trouble</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.650" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">robots have so you know the best-selling</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:13.230" style="s2">domestic robot of all time is still</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:25.650" style="s2">in it or the famous Steve Wozniak test</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.299" end="00:32:27.659" style="s2">you know I thought this was a very</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:17.870" style="s2">with a long stalk and so you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.560" end="00:33:19.460" style="s2">go over to it decide which access is</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.870" end="00:33:20.900" style="s2">convenient and then grip it and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.460" end="00:33:22.940" style="s2">you&#39;d realize that the bottom piece is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.900" end="00:33:25.520" style="s2">actually just a holder and it would drop</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.940" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">and you&#39;d have to compensate for that be</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.870" end="00:33:36.860" style="s2">we&#39;re a 5 year old kid could do it right</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:38.060" style="s2">no problem I have one so I know it for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.860" end="00:33:40.010" style="s2">fact that she could do that with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.060" end="00:33:42.290" style="s2">problem I remember being five in fact my</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.290" end="00:33:45.560" style="s2">we were out of school I thought it would</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.940" end="00:33:48.890" style="s2">be interesting to teach us how to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.560" end="00:33:50.810" style="s2">housework right and so just like Tom</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.800" end="00:34:07.460" style="s2">which gets to my mind which damn close</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.990" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">to the meat of the matter of the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.460" end="00:34:12.770" style="s2">big step I mean heuristic induction is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">really big one but another one is what</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.100" end="00:34:49.669" style="s2">tried a few supposedly the top ones and</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">minutes what do you think the issues are</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.350" end="00:34:58.490" style="s2">around real language understand what</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:34:59.690" style="s2">real language understanding is what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.490" end="00:35:01.310" style="s2">might see there in the future</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.690" end="00:35:02.930" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been trying to cone a phrase of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.310" end="00:35:05.570" style="s2">deep understanding to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.930" end="00:35:07.160" style="s2">between deep learning so you could say</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.570" end="00:35:09.290" style="s2">that there&#39;s a shallow understanding in</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.160" end="00:35:11.270" style="s2">systems now right so Alexa can</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.290" end="00:35:14.840" style="s2">understand particular requests or you</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.300" end="00:35:21.290" style="s2">baseball it&#39;ll come back with baseball</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.220" end="00:35:23.240" style="s2">related terms or if you talk to it about</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.290" end="00:35:24.530" style="s2">chairs it&#39;ll come back with terms that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.240" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">are chairs so you could say there is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.530" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">superfish</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:27.809" style="s2">understanding but there&#39;s not a deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:30.059" style="s2">understanding there&#39;s no way that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.809" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">system understands that chairs are for</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.059" end="00:35:33.539" style="s2">sitting on or if you took away one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:35.220" style="s2">the legs the chair might fall over and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.539" end="00:35:37.079" style="s2">so it wouldn&#39;t be as good a chair to sit</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.220" end="00:35:38.130" style="s2">on so they&#39;re a couple things that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.079" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">missing one we already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.130" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">these cumulative models of the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what language is about is I build</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:47.309" style="s2">in your head a model of something and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.240" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">then you kind of check your model</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.309" end="00:35:51.809" style="s2">against mine or you elaborate it that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">whole process is missing and then common</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.809" end="00:35:55.260" style="s2">sense is missing so one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:56.519" style="s2">we can do this that I can tell you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.260" end="00:35:57.809" style="s2">you move that chair over there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.519" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">because you know what a chair does and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.809" end="00:36:01.980" style="s2">what it&#39;s for so you know a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">orientation for that chair is with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.980" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">flat surface up so that somebody could</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:07.170" style="s2">sit on it and that&#39;s spinning it upside</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:09.450" style="s2">down so that they would have to sit</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.170" end="00:36:11.190" style="s2">between the feet of the chair is not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.450" end="00:36:12.599" style="s2">reasonable thing because that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.190" end="00:36:16.019" style="s2">accommodate the way that people&#39;s butts</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.599" end="00:36:17.700" style="s2">work and so you know something about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.019" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">the world works and you integrate that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.700" end="00:36:21.809" style="s2">with a model of the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:23.670" style="s2">talking about and that&#39;s what language</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.809" end="00:36:25.799" style="s2">is about and that none of that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.670" end="00:36:28.319" style="s2">there yet so I&#39;m gonna hop ahead on my</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.799" end="00:36:30.029" style="s2">questions list because you opened up</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.319" end="00:36:33.690" style="s2">something that&#39;s interesting which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.029" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">common sense or knowledge engineering as</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.690" end="00:36:38.789" style="s2">we used to call it a good old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:40.980" style="s2">AI or knowledge engineers or the closest</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.789" end="00:36:42.809" style="s2">approximation we had graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.980" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">would create representations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.809" end="00:36:46.799" style="s2">knowledge or common sense within send</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:49.980" style="s2">domain and then we&#39;ve had some larger</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.799" end="00:36:53.309" style="s2">scale projects like psych and concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.980" end="00:36:55.380" style="s2">net and yet none of that seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.309" end="00:36:57.539" style="s2">really gotten the kind of traction that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.380" end="00:36:59.789" style="s2">we need you know any thoughts on why not</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.539" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">and is there something like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.789" end="00:37:05.220" style="s2">brute force way to extract common sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">that deep learning has been able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.220" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">extract statistical regularities well</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:10.859" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:14.519" style="s2">questions there so I may lose some but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.859" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">I&#39;ll start with psych psych is the to my</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.519" end="00:37:17.220" style="s2">knowledge the biggest knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:19.799" style="s2">engineering project of all time although</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.220" end="00:37:21.750" style="s2">there might be some medical taxonomy is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.799" end="00:37:24.509" style="s2">that that are in some way similar in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.750" end="00:37:27.539" style="s2">scope and what Doug Leonard tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.509" end="00:37:29.460" style="s2">and is in fact still trying to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.539" end="00:37:31.529" style="s2">codify much of the world&#39;s knowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.460" end="00:37:33.450" style="s2">a machine interpretable form I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.529" end="00:37:35.549" style="s2">that the specifics of how he did it</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.450" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">maybe aren&#39;t quite what we would do</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.549" end="00:37:42.500" style="s2">today so he did it very much informal</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:44.330" style="s2">logical terms and that may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.500" end="00:37:46.070" style="s2">flexible enough so some things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.330" end="00:37:49.010" style="s2">people would emphasize now would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.070" end="00:37:50.810" style="s2">uncertainty probability distributions so</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.010" end="00:37:52.250" style="s2">when I know about chairs I don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.810" end="00:37:54.050" style="s2">know some formal things about them but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.250" end="00:37:55.220" style="s2">know kind of the distribution of chairs</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.050" end="00:37:56.900" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen before and what their</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.220" end="00:37:59.450" style="s2">properties are that kind of stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.900" end="00:38:02.180" style="s2">believe is not represented in there I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.450" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">think as a system one of the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.180" end="00:38:05.390" style="s2">it has is there&#39;s actually not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:08.030" style="s2">natural language interface it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.390" end="00:38:11.450" style="s2">the formal logic part and it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.030" end="00:38:13.010" style="s2">that taking lenox reasoning system in</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.450" end="00:38:15.170" style="s2">conjunction with a good natural language</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.010" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">interface might actually be very useful</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.170" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">because that doesn&#39;t exist I think it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">limits the utility of what he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.920" end="00:38:22.220" style="s2">generally it&#39;s regarded as a failure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s actually the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.220" end="00:38:25.580" style="s2">interpretation it might be that he</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">solved the piece of the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.580" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">since he hasn&#39;t solved the whole problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not very commercial and then people</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">infer falsely that because he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.620" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">solved the whole problem been a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:36.590" style="s2">commercial success that there&#39;s no value</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:38.180" style="s2">there and that may not be correct as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.590" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">implying I would do it differently</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.180" end="00:38:41.390" style="s2">nowadays I would have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:42.830" style="s2">representation of uncertainty and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.390" end="00:38:45.650" style="s2">got pretty good arguments that you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.830" end="00:38:47.330" style="s2">want the power of a formal logic and not</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.650" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">just a first-order logic you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.330" end="00:38:51.020" style="s2">able to represent things like I believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:52.520" style="s2">that you think that such-and-such is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.020" end="00:38:55.220" style="s2">going on and that requires fairly</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.520" end="00:38:56.740" style="s2">sophisticated logic there is no formal</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.220" end="00:38:59.510" style="s2">argument out there that he&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.740" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are allergic</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.510" end="00:39:03.320" style="s2">to what he did but none of them so far</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:06.050" style="s2">as I know have a serious alternative</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.320" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">maybe the closest alternative is some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.050" end="00:39:09.170" style="s2">the work that agent joy has been doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:11.570" style="s2">recently at University Washington and</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.420" end="00:40:00.110" style="s2">me through some of it and when it works</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.430" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">it&#39;s really impressive how much it can</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.110" end="00:40:03.350" style="s2">infer about like why certain characters</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.350" end="00:40:06.290" style="s2">what&#39;s unimpressive about it is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.030" end="00:40:08.300" style="s2">a lot of it&#39;s a sort of hand written</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.290" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">about Romeo and Juliet so it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.430" end="00:40:17.240" style="s2">knowledge is represented there can make</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.870" end="00:40:18.980" style="s2">much more sophisticated inferences than</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.240" end="00:40:21.530" style="s2">anything else that&#39;s out there and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.980" end="00:40:24.050" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s been miscast at</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.530" end="00:40:26.630" style="s2">least in people&#39;s minds you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.050" end="00:40:29.720" style="s2">it&#39;s really good at I think is making</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.630" end="00:40:32.930" style="s2">logical inferences about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.720" end="00:40:35.150" style="s2">people and actions and their interaction</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.930" end="00:40:37.820" style="s2">with one another nobody else really has</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:39.380" style="s2">that right now it&#39;s not an end-to-end</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.820" end="00:40:41.240" style="s2">system and what people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.380" end="00:40:43.670" style="s2">build now our systems that kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.240" end="00:40:44.990" style="s2">from pixels to action and if we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.670" end="00:40:46.070" style="s2">get those the work that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.990" end="00:40:48.650" style="s2">but the reality is they&#39;re incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.070" end="00:40:50.510" style="s2">fragile that we give in the book the</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.130" end="00:40:58.460" style="s2">plays Atari games and you read the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.660" end="00:40:59.840" style="s2">original paper and it says it learns to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.460" end="00:41:01.490" style="s2">break through the tunnel and have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.840" end="00:41:02.930" style="s2">you know the paddle hits the ball</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.490" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">through the wall and it does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.930" end="00:41:07.970" style="s2">ricocheting thing but that&#39;s that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">illusion of progress and gullibility gap</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.970" end="00:41:10.940" style="s2">just because you see the machine and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:12.170" style="s2">think that that&#39;s what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.940" end="00:41:13.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they do it that&#39;s what the</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.800" end="00:41:19.460" style="s2">in a really cool paper then you see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.260" end="00:41:20.810" style="s2">system doesn&#39;t actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.460" end="00:41:22.490" style="s2">anything at all it doesn&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:31.580" style="s2">mistakes left and right well that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.170" end="00:41:33.380" style="s2">you know reinforcement learning works</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.580" end="00:41:35.150" style="s2">right it just basically takes one step</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.380" end="00:41:37.250" style="s2">after the other and then it figures out</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.150" end="00:41:39.230" style="s2">at the end was there a payoff and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.250" end="00:41:40.730" style="s2">it up boats all those links that led to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.230" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2">a payoff at the end so that&#39;s what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.730" end="00:41:44.840" style="s2">expect and if you have enough data</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:46.790" style="s2">relative of let&#39;s say a particular level</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.840" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">in a video game it can play that game</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.790" end="00:41:51.080" style="s2">better than a human but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.490" style="s2">mean they can play the next level and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.080" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">you could think of this demo was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.490" end="00:41:55.850" style="s2">another level okay we will you know in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:41:57.590" style="s2">level two the battle will be in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.850" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">different place and it&#39;s it&#39;s at a loss</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.590" end="00:42:01.460" style="s2">it has to start over to learn that new</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.180" end="00:42:02.900" style="s2">level it doesn&#39;t have emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.460" end="00:42:05.660" style="s2">something I said earlier transferable</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.900" end="00:42:06.230" style="s2">knowledge about what a wall is or you</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.660" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">know kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.230" end="00:42:10.820" style="s2">physics of that game it just has this</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:12.680" style="s2">narrow knowledge about contingencies</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.820" end="00:42:14.060" style="s2">within this level if you play enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.680" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">times you can get contingencies for</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.060" end="00:42:18.770" style="s2">anything but the question is what do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">do when the world changes yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.770" end="00:42:22.820" style="s2">enough you can do that if the world is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:23.810" style="s2">small enough that&#39;s right and it is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.820" end="00:42:25.220" style="s2">know you&#39;ve made this point and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.810" end="00:42:27.710" style="s2">different different way talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.220" end="00:42:29.000" style="s2">branching factors and so forth and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.710" end="00:42:31.460" style="s2">been talking about narrowness if the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.000" end="00:42:33.380" style="s2">world is potentially complex enough that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.460" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">suddenly is not the right tool for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.380" end="00:42:38.210" style="s2">to use and so there&#39;s been a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">on that line and maybe something will</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.210" end="00:42:41.720" style="s2">come out of it there hasn&#39;t been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">of commercial applications so far and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.720" end="00:42:45.650" style="s2">whether or not people come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.720" style="s2">cool commercial application for it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.650" end="00:42:49.609" style="s2">really not the solution for AI in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.720" end="00:42:52.520" style="s2">open-ended world it&#39;s just not well</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.609" end="00:42:55.310" style="s2">suited to that let&#39;s finish off on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.520" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">psych concept net area I think I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.310" end="00:42:58.580" style="s2">kind of ill-formed question but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:01.970" style="s2">gonna try to form it better do you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.580" end="00:43:04.010" style="s2">any thoughts on how a next step in AI</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.970" end="00:43:06.290" style="s2">research might be able to extract</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.010" end="00:43:09.080" style="s2">common-sense knowledge from the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.290" end="00:43:12.859" style="s2">world in something like a symbolic form</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.080" end="00:43:14.780" style="s2">at least analogously to the way deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.859" end="00:43:18.290" style="s2">learning extracts the statistical</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.780" end="00:43:20.450" style="s2">patterns from example sets I think is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.290" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">probably possible I think that the roots</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.450" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">of that are in things like inductive</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:26.990" style="s2">logic programming but that we need</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.800" end="00:43:29.420" style="s2">richer an eight basis in these systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:31.220" style="s2">so they have prior knowledge about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.420" end="00:43:33.140" style="s2">objects work and people work not</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.220" end="00:43:35.450" style="s2">everything but some like knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.140" end="00:43:38.060" style="s2">objects exist that they persist in time</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.450" end="00:43:39.619" style="s2">and so forth in order to kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.060" end="00:43:42.530" style="s2">scaffolding such that when these</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.619" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">incoming facts arrive that the system</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.530" end="00:43:46.430" style="s2">can do something with it what people</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:47.930" style="s2">have tended to do has no prior knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.430" end="00:43:50.840" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t work very well so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.930" end="00:43:52.970" style="s2">for example Tom Mitchell&#39;s Nobel but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.840" end="00:43:54.680" style="s2">think unsuccessful attempt called nail</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.970" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">never-ending language learner which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.680" end="00:43:58.280" style="s2">guess is still running at Carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:43:59.960" style="s2">Mellon and it tries to extract triples</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.280" end="00:44:01.730" style="s2">from the world and sometimes it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.960" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">with things like you know Barack Obama</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.730" end="00:44:05.740" style="s2">is the President of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:08.150" style="s2">and they&#39;re okay they can be outdated</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.740" end="00:44:10.550" style="s2">sometimes the the facts are really</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.150" end="00:44:12.980" style="s2">really poor because the system doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.550" end="00:44:15.109" style="s2">understand about entity disambiguation</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.980" end="00:44:17.390" style="s2">let&#39;s say so it comes up with facts like</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.109" end="00:44:19.310" style="s2">Barry as a painter and you&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.390" end="00:44:21.500" style="s2">which Barry it doesn&#39;t really tell me</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.310" end="00:44:24.950" style="s2">what kind of painter using our artist</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.500" end="00:44:26.570" style="s2">does he do houses and and so the a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.950" end="00:44:28.180" style="s2">of the knowledge is kind of under</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.570" end="00:44:31.910" style="s2">differentiated in a way that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.180" end="00:44:33.800" style="s2">useless and like the spirit of what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.910" end="00:44:35.870" style="s2">think Mitchell was trying to do is great</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.800" end="00:44:38.780" style="s2">in the age enjoy again is doing some</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.870" end="00:44:40.370" style="s2">stuff in in this vein I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.780" end="00:44:41.690" style="s2">have the tools yet I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.690" end="00:44:46.550" style="s2">great area to try to make some advances</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.120" end="00:44:48.140" style="s2">in yeah it seems to me it&#39;s fairly close</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.550" end="00:44:49.550" style="s2">to the you know again like well along</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.140" end="00:44:51.980" style="s2">with language understanding the core of</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.820" end="00:44:57.410" style="s2">suppose one were to think through a</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:44:59.350" style="s2">project somewhat analogous to psyche but</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.410" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">with everything we know today about</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:05.450" style="s2">and the knowledge we have about</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.450" end="00:45:09.290" style="s2">neuroscience you think it could be</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.450" end="00:45:15.980" style="s2">quickly what could it make sense to do a</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.980" end="00:45:20.990" style="s2">now to start over completely from</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.990" end="00:45:25.490" style="s2">for AI I think be a huge deal I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.140" end="00:45:27.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a five hundred million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.490" end="00:45:29.720" style="s2">project and nobody has the appetite for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.500" end="00:45:31.790" style="s2">it right now I wrote down a billion and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.720" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">I said a billion who cares you know AG</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.790" end="00:45:37.460" style="s2">is worth trillions right I think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:39.860" style="s2">well worth doing and you know after my</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.460" end="00:45:41.570" style="s2">robots a company becomes a huge success</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.860" end="00:45:42.860" style="s2">or maybe as a spin out of it or</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.570" end="00:45:44.990" style="s2">something like that maybe I&#39;ll take that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.860" end="00:45:47.390" style="s2">on well I guess I think about a billion</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.990" end="00:45:49.910" style="s2">your billions what the Europeans wasted</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.390" end="00:45:52.280" style="s2">on their brain initiative right with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.910" end="00:45:54.380" style="s2">original budget was a billion euros yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.280" end="00:45:56.090" style="s2">and as far as I can tell not helped lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.380" end="00:45:58.760" style="s2">came out of that you know think of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.090" end="00:46:01.310" style="s2">Obama stimulus it was seven hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.760" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">billion right take a billion of that put</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.310" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">it in Neos psyche is it&#39;s also less than</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:09.020" style="s2">the investments that say Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">Google / alphabet making AI each here</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.020" end="00:46:13.790" style="s2">but it&#39;s not to their taste yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:15.800" style="s2">contrary to the religion at least that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.790" end="00:46:18.020" style="s2">Google I mean you know Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.800" end="00:46:20.210" style="s2">perhaps a little less monomaniacal but</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.020" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">still mostly dominated in the deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.210" end="00:46:22.610" style="s2">learning approach let&#39;s hop back a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.610" end="00:46:25.010" style="s2">again we hopped around little bit here</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:27.590" style="s2">but that&#39;s part of the fun of doing a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.010" end="00:46:29.190" style="s2">podcast make it somewhat nonlinear we</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.590" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">were talking about language it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.190" end="00:46:33.450" style="s2">that really hopped out and from the book</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">which resonated with me is that you said</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.450" end="00:46:37.650" style="s2">human thought and language or</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.869" style="s2">compositional you know as our by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.650" end="00:46:41.130" style="s2">most good techniques for doing computer</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.869" end="00:46:43.650" style="s2">programming could you tell our audience</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.130" end="00:46:46.050" style="s2">what you mean by compositional and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.650" end="00:46:47.700" style="s2">without why that&#39;s relevant so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.050" end="00:46:50.460" style="s2">actually take a computer programming</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.700" end="00:46:52.290" style="s2">first so the way that we build complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.460" end="00:46:54.060" style="s2">computer systems is we build small</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.290" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">modules and then we but larger modules</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.060" end="00:46:57.480" style="s2">out of those smaller modules you make</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:58.920" style="s2">sure that the small pieces work and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.480" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">you make bigger pieces outside of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.920" end="00:47:03.390" style="s2">so that&#39;s a form of compositionality</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:05.400" style="s2">sentences are the same way so we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.390" end="00:47:07.589" style="s2">small pieces like nouns and verbs and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.400" end="00:47:09.180" style="s2">can make more complex pieces like noun</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.589" end="00:47:10.680" style="s2">phrases and verb phrases and then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.180" end="00:47:12.660" style="s2">make sentences out of those and we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.680" end="00:47:15.660" style="s2">make sentences sub sentences of other</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.660" end="00:47:17.339" style="s2">sentences so I can say I like my new</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.660" end="00:47:19.050" style="s2">iPhone and then I can say you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.339" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2">I like my new iPhone and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.050" end="00:47:22.980" style="s2">your friend thinks that you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.150" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">like my new iPhone and so forth so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:25.560" style="s2">can put together little pieces inside a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:28.349" style="s2">bigger pieces that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.560" end="00:47:30.750" style="s2">compositionality is about for the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.349" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">part the current approaches don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.750" end="00:47:34.920" style="s2">do that they look at all the words in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:37.619" style="s2">sentence before and after and try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.920" end="00:47:39.720" style="s2">find other sentences that have similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.619" end="00:47:41.819" style="s2">vocabulary in them and similar as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.720" end="00:47:43.230" style="s2">of complex notion in these systems but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.819" end="00:47:45.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t really look at structure in</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.230" end="00:47:47.940" style="s2">that way so they don&#39;t come back to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.240" end="00:47:50.430" style="s2">and say that you know this clause is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.940" end="00:47:52.619" style="s2">about somebody&#39;s intention and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.430" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">other clause is about their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.619" end="00:47:56.369" style="s2">on that intention and we&#39;re gonna put it</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">together in order to make this statement</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.369" end="00:48:00.329" style="s2">about the world and we&#39;re gonna derive</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:02.460" style="s2">this cumulative description of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.329" end="00:48:04.050" style="s2">going on that just isn&#39;t really part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.460" end="00:48:05.460" style="s2">the current workflow and they I there</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.050" end="00:48:08.250" style="s2">has been work on that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.460" end="00:48:10.109" style="s2">historically but right now because deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.250" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">learning is making better short term</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.109" end="00:48:14.609" style="s2">results people are focusing there and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:16.740" style="s2">think losing sight of compositionality</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.609" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">as really the the core thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.740" end="00:48:20.609" style="s2">trying to come up with and make a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:23.550" style="s2">distinction for the audience there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.609" end="00:48:27.390" style="s2">storica Leben divided between symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.550" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">AI and sub symbolic AI which deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.390" end="00:48:32.460" style="s2">learning and neural nets are the primary</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:34.530" style="s2">example and historically symbolic AI has</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.460" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">been compositional or at least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.530" end="00:48:39.630" style="s2">could be while mostly sub symbolic has</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:40.619" style="s2">not been compositional the only thing I</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.630" end="00:48:42.930" style="s2">would add to that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.619" end="00:48:44.760" style="s2">distinction itself is confused so</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.930" end="00:48:46.650" style="s2">every neural network that I know has for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.760" end="00:48:48.300" style="s2">example output notes that are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.650" end="00:48:50.490" style="s2">symbols and so nobody&#39;s been ever that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.300" end="00:48:53.190" style="s2">clear to me about what sub symbols</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.490" end="00:48:55.290" style="s2">really mean but it is true that they try</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.190" end="00:48:57.450" style="s2">to make do without certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.290" end="00:48:59.190" style="s2">representations like operations over</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.450" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">variables and structured representations</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.190" end="00:49:03.510" style="s2">at any programming language from</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.510" end="00:49:07.349" style="s2">granted and I think that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.910" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of tying their hands behind</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.349" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">their back taking away one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.559" style="s2">valuable discoveries in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:16.530" style="s2">humanity which is how to write computer</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.559" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">programs compositionally and that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">relatively recent he&#39;ll I&#39;m old enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:21.540" style="s2">that I remember when people wrote these</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">horrifying in fact I did something</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.540" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">myself he&#39;s horrifying 1,500 line</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.490" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">Fortran programs that were just ugly</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.470" end="00:49:29.160" style="s2">bags of spaghetti right yeah I just</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.500" style="s2">write in basic with all these go-to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.160" end="00:49:33.150" style="s2">lines then it was completely not modular</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.500" end="00:49:35.130" style="s2">it was a mess it was hard to debug and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.150" end="00:49:36.510" style="s2">it was hard for someone else to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.130" end="00:49:38.460" style="s2">understand your code if they looked at</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.510" end="00:49:41.250" style="s2">it later because it was not sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.460" end="00:49:42.420" style="s2">modular it&#39;s not even those programs</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.250" end="00:49:44.309" style="s2">though you have to say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:47.099" style="s2">compositional in the sense that even a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.309" end="00:49:49.349" style="s2">line of basic code if a equals B is</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.099" end="00:49:52.230" style="s2">still a symbolic system it wasn&#39;t a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.349" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">well structured symbolic system so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:55.710" style="s2">know there&#39;s symbols at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.400" end="00:49:57.630" style="s2">your basic operations and even basic or</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.710" end="00:49:59.130" style="s2">Fortran or whatever is completely</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.630" end="00:50:01.079" style="s2">symbolic in that sense and deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.130" end="00:50:02.730" style="s2">systems for the most part don&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.079" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">that and you have people like geoff</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.730" end="00:50:06.510" style="s2">hinton trying to say don&#39;t go there</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:08.869" style="s2">don&#39;t look at that kind of stuff it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.869" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">but you know all of the world&#39;s computer</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.130" end="00:50:26.040" style="s2">on top of modules and you have</p>

<p begin="00:50:26.040" end="00:50:31.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s very much from the symbol</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.380" end="00:50:34.470" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna talk about it before</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.059" end="00:50:36.599" style="s2">you do that though you would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.470" end="00:50:38.819" style="s2">how human language is composition let me</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.599" end="00:50:40.500" style="s2">do a little sidebar on something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.819" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">stumbled across recently I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.500" end="00:50:45.269" style="s2">understood it well enough to say this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:47.240" style="s2">accurately so lay it out - you get your</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.269" end="00:50:49.559" style="s2">comments and that&#39;s some of the newer</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.240" end="00:50:52.170" style="s2">forms of neural networks particularly</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.559" end="00:50:54.569" style="s2">graph neural nets and they&#39;re closely</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.170" end="00:50:57.750" style="s2">related message-passing neural Nets seem</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.569" end="00:50:59.869" style="s2">to have some aspects of compositionality</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.750" end="00:51:02.730" style="s2">to them or at least they act upon</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.869" end="00:51:05.430" style="s2">compositional components they&#39;re better</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.730" end="00:51:08.849" style="s2">so the graph networks have a graph</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.430" end="00:51:11.369" style="s2">structure which is from straight symbol</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.849" end="00:51:13.049" style="s2">manipulation and I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.369" end="00:51:15.180" style="s2">prerequisite essentially it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.049" end="00:51:17.309" style="s2">that knowledge is represented as things</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.180" end="00:51:20.250" style="s2">that look like a network or a tree or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.309" end="00:51:22.470" style="s2">graph technical terms and that allows</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.250" end="00:51:24.359" style="s2">you for example to formally specify the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.470" end="00:51:26.910" style="s2">relationships between things you can say</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.359" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">the molle is the father of Gary or</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.910" end="00:51:31.589" style="s2">something like that or my mother if Gary</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.160" end="00:51:33.960" style="s2">excuse me so you can you can make</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.589" end="00:51:35.490" style="s2">specific claims about relations as</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.960" end="00:51:36.569" style="s2">opposed to a lot of neural networks</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:39.960" style="s2">that&#39;s just like character by character</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.569" end="00:51:41.759" style="s2">you feed in a sentence and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.960" end="00:51:44.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a step in the right direction I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.759" end="00:51:45.750" style="s2">think there&#39;s still too little in</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.190" end="00:51:48.059" style="s2">general formal reasoning over those</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.750" end="00:51:49.529" style="s2">systems not a great way of representing</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.059" end="00:51:51.240" style="s2">abstractions as opposed to specific</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.529" end="00:51:51.930" style="s2">facts but I think it&#39;s a step in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.240" end="00:51:54.269" style="s2">right direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.930" end="00:51:56.670" style="s2">okay let&#39;s talk back to human language</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.269" end="00:51:57.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s a composite compositionality</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.670" end="00:51:59.279" style="s2">there we go</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.720" end="00:52:01.319" style="s2">well so I mean I already gave you one</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.279" end="00:52:03.299" style="s2">example of compositionality you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.319" end="00:52:06.599" style="s2">sentence about you know I like an iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.299" end="00:52:08.609" style="s2">so an iPhone is a noun phrase iPhone is</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.599" end="00:52:12.029" style="s2">a noun we&#39;re putting those together to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.609" end="00:52:14.069" style="s2">pick out particular iPhone and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.029" end="00:52:15.930" style="s2">we&#39;re using like as a verb and we make a</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.069" end="00:52:17.789" style="s2">verb phrase like an iPhone that we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.930" end="00:52:19.410" style="s2">a subject to it I like an iPhone and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.789" end="00:52:21.059" style="s2">then we can make that whole Clause part</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.410" end="00:52:23.369" style="s2">of another sentence so I can say you</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.059" end="00:52:26.549" style="s2">know that I like an iPhone and so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.369" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">know you as a noun know as a verb and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.549" end="00:52:31.500" style="s2">then we have this whole clause that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:33.539" style="s2">represents an idea a proposition is as</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.500" end="00:52:35.609" style="s2">some people would call it of I like an</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.539" end="00:52:37.559" style="s2">iPhone and so we have a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.609" end="00:52:40.019" style="s2">verbs that are what we call</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.559" end="00:52:41.849" style="s2">propositional attitude so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.019" end="00:52:43.529" style="s2">I like an iPhone or you deny that I like</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.849" end="00:52:44.740" style="s2">an iPhone or you doubt that I like an</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.529" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.740" end="00:52:48.610" style="s2">and you have all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:50.650" style="s2">possibilities compositionality it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.610" end="00:52:53.980" style="s2">about the whole being computed from</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.650" end="00:52:56.650" style="s2">parts so once I know how verbs like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.980" end="00:52:58.150" style="s2">work and I know how nouns like iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.650" end="00:53:00.310" style="s2">work and I can put together the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.150" end="00:53:02.110" style="s2">sentence you know once I know all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.310" end="00:53:04.600" style="s2">those pieces and I can derive an</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.110" end="00:53:06.369" style="s2">interpretation of something in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.600" end="00:53:09.100" style="s2">how its pieces work which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.369" end="00:53:11.050" style="s2">exactly how you know computer compilers</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.100" end="00:53:13.510" style="s2">and computer interpreters work is they</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.050" end="00:53:16.150" style="s2">make a composition of the components</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.510" end="00:53:18.340" style="s2">that tells them what to do I like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.150" end="00:53:20.410" style="s2">phrase was it the whole being computed</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.340" end="00:53:22.030" style="s2">from the parts that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.410" end="00:53:24.070" style="s2">yeah I love that that should be people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.030" end="00:53:25.030" style="s2">number one takeaway on what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.070" end="00:53:27.010" style="s2">talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.030" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">let&#39;s pop up a level we talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.010" end="00:53:32.680" style="s2">lot of details in and out and around of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">deep learning and kind of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.680" end="00:53:37.300" style="s2">approaches more broadly what are some</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:39.010" style="s2">other approaches to AI that may not be</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.300" end="00:53:41.619" style="s2">getting enough attention in your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.010" end="00:53:43.420" style="s2">well I think that all the action right</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.619" end="00:53:45.190" style="s2">now is actually on hybrid models and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.420" end="00:53:46.540" style="s2">some people are actually building them</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.190" end="00:53:48.220" style="s2">not enough people are talking about why</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.540" end="00:53:50.710" style="s2">they&#39;re important as opposed to deep</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.220" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">learning so I again worry that Geoff</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.710" end="00:53:53.320" style="s2">Hinton has too much influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:55.150" style="s2">field he&#39;s been going around you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.320" end="00:53:57.550" style="s2">he&#39;s the Godfather of deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.150" end="00:53:59.859" style="s2">going around saying that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.550" end="00:54:01.510" style="s2">build hybrid models that we should just</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.859" end="00:54:03.400" style="s2">use deep learning with some simple</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.510" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">manipulation is old-fashioned but if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.400" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">look at what people actually do when</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:08.140" style="s2">they want to get something done they</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.270" style="s2">actually do build hybrid models so</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.140" end="00:54:12.310" style="s2">alphago is an example of this he uses</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.270" end="00:54:14.080" style="s2">deep learning to recognize patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.310" end="00:54:15.580" style="s2">then it uses tree search Monte Carlo</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.080" end="00:54:18.970" style="s2">tree search in particular which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.580" end="00:54:20.890" style="s2">straight symbolic operation to actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.970" end="00:54:22.660" style="s2">search the space of possibilities I go</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.890" end="00:54:24.369" style="s2">there you go there let&#39;s look at a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.660" end="00:54:26.680" style="s2">of different possibilities and add it up</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.369" end="00:54:28.869" style="s2">that&#39;s a symbolic computer program of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.680" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">the classic sort they combine that with</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.869" end="00:54:34.630" style="s2">deep learning so that&#39;s a hybrid model</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:36.550" style="s2">Josh Tenenbaum our mutual friend works</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.630" end="00:54:38.680" style="s2">on hybrid models he&#39;s got one on vision</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.550" end="00:54:41.590" style="s2">recently with a bunch of people on IBM</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.680" end="00:54:43.990" style="s2">where you use deep learning to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.590" end="00:54:45.430" style="s2">parts of images but then you do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.990" end="00:54:46.840" style="s2">reasoning about what those parts of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.430" end="00:54:49.330" style="s2">those images are and what they relate to</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.330" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">uses a lot of symbolic operations in</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.970" end="00:54:55.210" style="s2">order to do that so that half of the</p>

<p begin="00:56:32.190" end="00:56:35.819" style="s2">but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a huge bias and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:38.010" style="s2">how these things are reported</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.819" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">similarly the open AI when they talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.010" end="00:56:41.609" style="s2">about the rubix system said a pair of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:43.290" style="s2">neural networks learns to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.609" end="00:56:44.849" style="s2">such-and-such and you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.290" end="00:56:46.619" style="s2">read the fine print to realize that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.849" end="00:56:48.450" style="s2">not just the neural networks that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.619" end="00:56:51.290" style="s2">doing the system here but there&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.290" end="00:56:54.750" style="s2">algorithm that&#39;s kind of at the core of</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.750" end="00:56:58.470" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of hype around neural</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.940" end="00:57:00.450" style="s2">networks and people present their</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.470" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">systems that way even when there&#39;s other</p>

<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:06.030" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m funny I had a conversation no</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.030" end="00:57:10.770" style="s2">people in the world I would say not in</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.920" end="00:57:20.580" style="s2">days was deep learning I was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.930" end="00:57:21.900" style="s2">shocked I had to disabuse them of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.580" end="00:57:24.300" style="s2">notion it&#39;s a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.900" end="00:57:26.070" style="s2">misunderstanding in part because the</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.140" end="00:57:37.860" style="s2">non-profit so that fits under that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.090" end="00:57:39.690" style="s2">umbrella so Zack Lipton called a</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.860" end="00:57:41.910" style="s2">weapons-grade PR so you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.690" end="00:57:44.610" style="s2">weapons great PR behind neural networks</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.910" end="00:57:46.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s a nice story to tell the media</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.610" end="00:57:47.820" style="s2">about hey these are like brains and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.230" end="00:57:49.380" style="s2">work great but they&#39;re not really that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.820" end="00:57:50.820" style="s2">much like brains and it turns out you</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.380" end="00:57:52.320" style="s2">need other systems to kind of prop them</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.820" end="00:57:53.850" style="s2">up and so forth but that&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.320" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">complicated story and people aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.850" end="00:57:57.240" style="s2">receptive to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:58.650" style="s2">what about evolutionary approaches and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.240" end="00:58:00.600" style="s2">happens to be something dear to my heart</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.650" end="00:58:02.280" style="s2">you know my deepest grounding at a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.600" end="00:58:05.670" style="s2">scientific field is evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.280" end="00:58:07.470" style="s2">computing and as early as 2001 I did</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.670" end="00:58:09.300" style="s2">some work with evolutionary neural nets</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.470" end="00:58:11.010" style="s2">and other evolutionary approaches to</p>

<p begin="00:58:11.010" end="00:58:15.960" style="s2">going on in evolutionary AI these days I</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.280" end="00:58:18.630" style="s2">think it&#39;s a lot of potential but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.960" end="00:58:20.070" style="s2">hasn&#39;t succeeded and my take on it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.630" end="00:58:22.470" style="s2">because everybody&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.070" end="00:58:26.070" style="s2">recapitulate the period between the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.470" end="00:58:29.460" style="s2">beginning of life and getting to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.070" end="00:58:31.560" style="s2">know dog cognition and what they want is</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.460" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">not dog cognition they really want human</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.560" end="00:58:35.340" style="s2">cognition but starting from pre</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">bacterium isn&#39;t going to get there so</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.340" end="00:58:38.490" style="s2">you start with systems that are total</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:41.310" style="s2">blank slates they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.490" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">equivalent of a genetic basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.310" end="00:58:45.840" style="s2">vertebrate brain plant for example you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:48.120" style="s2">know it took close to a billion years of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.840" end="00:58:50.850" style="s2">evolution to get a vertebrate brain plan</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.120" end="00:58:52.320" style="s2">this is a very hard one evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.850" end="00:58:55.110" style="s2">struggle if I can anthropomorphize a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.320" end="00:58:58.230" style="s2">little bit and then things pick up and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.110" end="00:58:59.700" style="s2">pace from there but the AI systems that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.230" end="00:59:02.070" style="s2">people build are like the you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.700" end="00:59:03.750" style="s2">bacteria or pre bacteria level so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.070" end="00:59:04.950" style="s2">have a grad student work on it for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.750" end="00:59:06.330" style="s2">year and at the end they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.950" end="00:59:08.820" style="s2">much to show for it because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.330" end="00:59:10.740" style="s2">basically started from zero you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.820" end="00:59:12.150" style="s2">most interesting thing in my view and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.740" end="00:59:13.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit species chauvinist but</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.150" end="00:59:15.090" style="s2">the most interesting thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.980" end="00:59:17.250" style="s2">in evolution in the last few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.090" end="00:59:19.500" style="s2">million years is the evolution of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.250" end="00:59:21.270" style="s2">because people have such a different</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.500" end="00:59:22.950" style="s2">niche from other creatures and they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.270" end="00:59:24.450" style="s2">these amazing means of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.950" end="00:59:25.349" style="s2">transmission that you know they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.450" end="00:59:26.819" style="s2">little dim reflector</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.349" end="00:59:28.410" style="s2">than other primates but there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.819" end="00:59:30.660" style="s2">something special have this language</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.410" end="00:59:32.609" style="s2">thing but the whole thing didn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.660" end="00:59:34.829" style="s2">that long to evolve you know maximally</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.609" end="00:59:37.079" style="s2">seven million years and maybe as few as</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.829" end="00:59:39.299" style="s2">like a few hundred thousand well why did</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.079" end="00:59:42.269" style="s2">it happen so fast is because the primate</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.299" end="00:59:43.799" style="s2">brain plan on which the human brain plan</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.269" end="00:59:45.809" style="s2">evolved was already incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.799" end="00:59:48.059" style="s2">sophisticated so it already had color</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.809" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">vision it already had you know very</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.059" end="00:59:53.729" style="s2">sophisticated obstacle avoidance very</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:55.109" style="s2">sophisticated social cognition maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.729" end="00:59:57.029" style="s2">as sophisticated as ours but still</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.109" end="00:59:59.069" style="s2">pretty sophisticated and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.029" end="01:00:00.479" style="s2">evolve from a primate brain plant you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.069" end="01:00:03.450" style="s2">get all kinds of interesting things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.479" end="01:00:04.979" style="s2">happen if you if all from a bacterium</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.450" end="01:00:07.259" style="s2">it&#39;s just gonna take a long time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.979" end="01:00:09.769" style="s2">not impossible but you know you need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.259" end="01:00:12.989" style="s2">have a lot of kind of lucky selections</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.769" end="01:00:15.509" style="s2">or it may be not lucky you know natural</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.989" end="01:00:18.119" style="s2">selection you know very fit selection</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.509" end="01:00:19.499" style="s2">you need a lot of them to get from point</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.119" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">A to point B which is why I took you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.499" end="01:00:23.099" style="s2">know so many hundreds of millions of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:26.190" style="s2">years actually took longer than you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.099" end="01:00:29.549" style="s2">think life&#39;s at least 3.5 billion years</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.190" end="01:00:31.529" style="s2">old and the vertebra lines didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.549" end="01:00:35.670" style="s2">get rollin till the Cambrian explosion a</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.529" end="01:00:37.950" style="s2">mere 550 million years ago so the single</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.670" end="01:00:40.229" style="s2">cell and the colonial species were</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.950" end="01:00:42.539" style="s2">basically doing their thing for almost 3</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.229" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">billion years that&#39;s early and and most</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.539" end="01:00:46.469" style="s2">of the work is recapitulating that 3</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.869" style="s2">billion and most of the interest would</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.469" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">be in recapitulating the more recent 500</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.869" end="01:00:52.289" style="s2">million yeah and that goes to your</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:54.900" style="s2">earlier suggestion and hint that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.289" end="01:00:57.059" style="s2">the answer is building you know these</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.900" end="01:00:59.759" style="s2">structures from which to let ai&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.059" end="01:01:01.469" style="s2">from these databases of what is known</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.759" end="01:01:03.630" style="s2">about the worldwide well I have to learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.469" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">all that stuff the hard way right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.630" end="01:01:06.059" style="s2">so you know I wrote a book about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:07.769" style="s2">called the birth of the mind which was</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.059" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">about how a small number of genes builds</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.769" end="01:01:12.329" style="s2">a complex brain and then part of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:14.819" style="s2">basic takeaway was that let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.329" end="01:01:16.979" style="s2">vertebrate brain plan is a very complex</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.900" end="01:01:39.569" style="s2">useful whereas if you look at a bacteria</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.999" end="01:01:40.920" style="s2">there&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:01:45.569" end="01:01:51.809" style="s2">you have to reinvent a lot I think</p>

<p begin="01:01:58.619" end="01:02:03.509" style="s2">things like sore and akhtar etc is there</p>

<p begin="01:02:12.420" end="01:02:17.549" style="s2">looking at I think that the general</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.630" end="01:02:20.099" style="s2">issue is first of all those things were</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.549" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">mostly built originally for cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.099" end="01:02:23.880" style="s2">psychology rather than AI in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">discussion right now is mostly around AI</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.880" end="01:02:29.999" style="s2">another issue in psychology is they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:31.979" style="s2">might be true insofar as they go but in</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.999" end="01:02:33.390" style="s2">a way they go too far so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.979" end="01:02:36.119" style="s2">compatible with a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.390" end="01:02:38.459" style="s2">things I think that&#39;s okay but people</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.119" end="01:02:40.890" style="s2">are expecting that if I choose soar than</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.459" end="01:02:42.180" style="s2">automatically or akhtar whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.890" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">that gives me the answer to cognition</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.180" end="01:02:46.829" style="s2">whereas it&#39;s kind of like a notation</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.640" end="01:02:48.569" style="s2">that could allow you to build a model of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.829" end="01:02:51.869" style="s2">cognition rather than the full model of</p>

<p begin="01:02:51.869" end="01:02:57.749" style="s2">far as I know all that practical right</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.410" end="01:02:59.579" style="s2">now I think that the intuitions behind</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.749" end="01:03:00.779" style="s2">what those people are trying to do are</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.579" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">good though and I think that there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.779" end="01:03:05.459" style="s2">lessons to be learned from looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.150" end="01:03:08.819" style="s2">how they go about problems like how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.459" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">you train a person to fly an airplane or</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.819" end="01:03:12.390" style="s2">learn algebra what are the steps that a</p>

<p begin="01:03:17.190" end="01:03:20.519" style="s2">in the process of learning these higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.569" end="01:03:23.279" style="s2">order skills might be very helpful</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.020" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">because there was bias on the part of</p>

<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:17.980" style="s2">love this point that you made which I</p>

<p begin="01:10:15.160" end="01:10:19.090" style="s2">true that has to be happening right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.600" end="01:10:20.380" style="s2">or because it has particular examples I</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.090" end="01:10:21.850" style="s2">think we gave unless this was in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.380" end="01:10:25.180" style="s2">article that we wrote and not in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.850" end="01:10:27.490" style="s2">book it was about translation and so you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.180" end="01:10:29.860" style="s2">know some translations are done by</p>

<p begin="01:10:33.840" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">to google translate yeah it crystallizes</p>

<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:41.130" style="s2">would imagine that&#39;s right right you did</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.300" end="01:10:42.930" style="s2">have that example in the book all right</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.130" end="01:10:45.090" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna head for the home stretch here</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.930" end="01:10:48.360" style="s2">and talk a little bit about artificial</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.090" end="01:10:51.540" style="s2">general intelligence when I look at the</p>

<p begin="01:10:59.970" end="01:11:06.750" style="s2">GI to me yeah I mean the if you had a GI</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.590" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">you in a bottle it would do all of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.750" end="01:11:11.250" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a GI in a bottle and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:12.210" style="s2">nobody does then you can try to take</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.250" end="01:11:13.860" style="s2">steps towards it</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.210" end="01:11:16.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not promising that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.860" end="01:11:18.150" style="s2">deliver a GI anytime soon of course we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.200" end="01:11:20.280" style="s2">like to position ourselves to you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.150" end="01:11:24.270" style="s2">be able to help in that discovery I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.280" end="01:11:27.000" style="s2">think each of those criteria are steps</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.270" end="01:11:29.820" style="s2">towards a GI or you know our metrics</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.000" end="01:11:32.970" style="s2">that could measure progress towards a GI</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.820" end="01:11:35.580" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find commercial cases</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.970" end="01:11:37.650" style="s2">that are steps along the way you know we</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.580" end="01:11:39.930" style="s2">can&#39;t promise that we&#39;re gonna solve all</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.650" end="01:11:42.570" style="s2">of it in a day but if we can make robots</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.930" end="01:11:44.310" style="s2">that are noticeably more flexible than</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.570" end="01:11:46.260" style="s2">the robots that we have now and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.310" end="01:11:48.660" style="s2">noticeably more reliable then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.260" end="01:11:50.760" style="s2">obviously gonna really expand the scope</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.660" end="01:11:54.120" style="s2">of application of robotics and right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.760" end="01:11:55.950" style="s2">robots have to be in you know in cages</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.120" end="01:11:58.260" style="s2">or they have to be in very carefully</p>

<p begin="01:13:21.210" end="01:13:26.370" style="s2">proto AGI and the things you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.240" end="01:13:28.260" style="s2">about there strike me exactly as proto</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.370" end="01:13:30.900" style="s2">AGI and I think that&#39;s gonna be a very</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.260" end="01:13:32.580" style="s2">hot area for companies in the coming few</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.900" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">years certainly hope so</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.580" end="01:13:35.610" style="s2">hahaha I think you&#39;re right well being</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:37.320" style="s2">right place let&#39;s bump it up a little</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.610" end="01:13:39.450" style="s2">bit you have to have thought about AGI</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.320" end="01:13:41.760" style="s2">what are your thoughts about time frame</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.450" end="01:13:43.200" style="s2">they&#39;re really getting days yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.760" end="01:13:46.200" style="s2">hard to know for sure I mean I always</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.200" end="01:13:48.600" style="s2">think about like in the you know early</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.200" end="01:13:50.280" style="s2">90s nobody had any idea how big the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.600" end="01:13:52.260" style="s2">internet would be and they had no idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.280" end="01:13:54.840" style="s2">that you know social networking would</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.260" end="01:13:57.900" style="s2">change national politics and all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.840" end="01:13:59.370" style="s2">of stuff so you know it&#39;s hard to really</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.900" end="01:14:00.540" style="s2">predict the future the example we gave</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.370" end="01:14:02.310" style="s2">in the book is in Blade Runner</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.540" end="01:14:04.980" style="s2">they have androids that are you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.310" end="01:14:06.540" style="s2">fully able to blend in with human beings</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.980" end="01:14:09.240" style="s2">and at one point they stopped at a</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.540" end="01:14:12.030" style="s2">payphone and this is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.240" end="01:14:14.310" style="s2">astonishingly anachronistic because you</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.030" end="01:14:15.990" style="s2">know cell phones were basically became</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.310" end="01:14:18.750" style="s2">widespread in the year 2000 and these</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.990" end="01:14:21.000" style="s2">robots are ways off so predicting is</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.750" end="01:14:23.280" style="s2">very hard but we can say for sure I</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.000" end="01:14:24.630" style="s2">think is no commercial system is</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.280" end="01:14:26.760" style="s2">remotely close to natural language</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.630" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">understanding which is certainly a</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.760" end="01:14:31.320" style="s2">prerequisite of AGI no commercial system</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.760" end="01:14:33.960" style="s2">is remotely close to the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.320" end="01:14:36.570" style="s2">flexible dynamic reasoning that people</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.960" end="01:14:38.670" style="s2">can do no current commercial system is</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.570" end="01:14:40.170" style="s2">close to being able to transfer between</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.670" end="01:14:42.210" style="s2">different tasks in the way that you were</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.170" end="01:14:44.760" style="s2">from one war game to another these</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.210" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">things don&#39;t exist yet they may exist in</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.760" end="01:14:49.500" style="s2">somebody&#39;s lap but they&#39;re not widely</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:51.030" style="s2">known and so it&#39;s gonna be a while you</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.500" end="01:14:53.160" style="s2">know that much we can be sure it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.030" end="01:14:55.350" style="s2">happening next week it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.160" end="01:14:57.690" style="s2">happening in five to ten years it might</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.350" end="01:15:00.449" style="s2">happen in 20 it&#39;s really hard to project</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.690" end="01:15:02.039" style="s2">and it might happen in 100</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.449" end="01:15:05.249" style="s2">because the problems are really really</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.039" end="01:15:07.380" style="s2">hard nobody has a bead on how to develop</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.249" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">enough understanding of the world in</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.380" end="01:15:11.039" style="s2">machine interpretable form right now for</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.840" end="01:15:14.039" style="s2">example there are a lot of problems that</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.039" end="01:15:15.510" style="s2">have to be solved so you know my guess</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.039" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">is somewhere between twenty and a</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.510" end="01:15:20.190" style="s2">hundred years maybe closer to fifty and</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:22.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a wide confidence interval people</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.190" end="01:15:23.820" style="s2">always want you know a number like</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.289" end="01:15:25.559" style="s2">reycarts while loves to say like a two</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.820" end="01:15:27.239" style="s2">thousand thirty one anybody that gives</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.559" end="01:15:28.619" style="s2">you a precise number is bullshitting you</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.239" end="01:15:31.139" style="s2">it has to be a confidence interval</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.619" end="01:15:33.449" style="s2">meaning you know within these boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.139" end="01:15:36.179" style="s2">with some likelihood we can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.449" end="01:15:40.519" style="s2">the way I satirize raise estimate as I</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.179" end="01:15:44.579" style="s2">say yeah February 26th at 11:30 p.m. in</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.519" end="01:15:46.889" style="s2">2042 we will achieve AGI right on West</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.579" end="01:15:48.989" style="s2">5th Street in Dallas right I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.889" end="01:15:50.639" style="s2">hyper precision makes it compelling to</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.989" end="01:15:52.349" style="s2">many people but it&#39;s actually a clear</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.639" end="01:15:54.389" style="s2">sign that it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.349" end="01:15:55.530" style="s2">about the error bars right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.389" end="01:15:57.630" style="s2">worried about with you it&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.530" end="01:15:59.670" style="s2">between 15 and a hundred and if I had to</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.630" end="01:16:01.860" style="s2">put down a small bed I&#39;d say forty to</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.670" end="01:16:03.659" style="s2">fifty something like that but who the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.860" end="01:16:05.039" style="s2">hell knows good happened tomorrow well</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.659" end="01:16:06.420" style="s2">no it couldn&#39;t happen tomorrow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.039" end="01:16:08.579" style="s2">the one thing that you really can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.420" end="01:16:10.199" style="s2">it&#39;s just not happening tomorrow five</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.579" end="01:16:12.599" style="s2">years this is probably the shortest</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.199" end="01:16:13.920" style="s2">possible period but I shouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.599" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">short as possible anyway let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.920" end="01:16:18.630" style="s2">speculate any further we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:21.329" style="s2">uncertain not tomorrow but probably</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.630" end="01:16:24.209" style="s2">within the lifetime of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.329" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">already alive which is interesting which</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.209" end="01:16:27.389" style="s2">brings us to the topic that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:29.639" style="s2">talk about at least a little bit even</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.389" end="01:16:31.619" style="s2">though I&#39;m bored to tears with it is AGI</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.639" end="01:16:33.659" style="s2">safety what are your thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.619" end="01:16:35.999" style="s2">I mean the line we have in the book is</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.659" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">is don&#39;t worry about killer robots at</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.999" end="01:16:39.780" style="s2">least any time soon first of all they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:42.119" style="s2">never shown any interest in our affairs</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.780" end="01:16:44.280" style="s2">or impacting us so worried about bad</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.119" end="01:16:46.590" style="s2">actors misusing AI but don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.280" end="01:16:50.159" style="s2">the robots rising up and second if they</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.590" end="01:16:51.749" style="s2">do come an attack lock your door and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.159" end="01:16:53.340" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work climb a tree because</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.749" end="01:16:55.349" style="s2">robots don&#39;t happen doors they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.340" end="01:16:57.300" style="s2">know how to climb trees they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.349" end="01:16:59.010" style="s2">not that bright right now so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.300" end="01:17:01.320" style="s2">have anything in the near-term to worry</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.010" end="01:17:02.880" style="s2">about alrighty I think we will wrap it</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.320" end="01:17:04.559" style="s2">up unfortunately we had lost some time</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.880" end="01:17:06.090" style="s2">with technical difficulties had about</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.559" end="01:17:07.590" style="s2">three or four more questions but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.090" end="01:17:10.170" style="s2">alright this has been extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.590" end="01:17:12.179" style="s2">interesting extraordinarily useful</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.170" end="01:17:13.650" style="s2">and I would strongly encourage people</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.179" end="01:17:15.870" style="s2">that are interested in questions like</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.650" end="01:17:17.190" style="s2">this to go out and Gary&#39;s book dari</p>
