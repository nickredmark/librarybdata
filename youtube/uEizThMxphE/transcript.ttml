<p begin="00:01:39.280" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">example about myself you know i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">in a close-in suburb of dc we figured we</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">were seven</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">miles as a crow flies from the white</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">house i was in fourth grade during the</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">in that place will likely never</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">forget and i was quite interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">topic of nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">i think part of it coming from my hobby</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">of playing war games the old avalon hill</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">war games that me and my friends played</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">from the time i was 10 years old</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">by the age of 12 i&#39;d read herman khan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">two books thinking about the unthinkable</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">and even that fat old tome on</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">thermonuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">you know i was one of those nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">nerds that could tell you that our icbm</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">force consisted of a thousand minute men</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">and 54</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">titans how about that i could even tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">you that the titans had 20 megaton</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">city buster warheads and i even visited</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">a decommissioned titan launch silo and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">command center outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">tucson which by the way i&#39;d strongly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">recommend as an interesting tourist</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">attraction should you be in the area</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">i even knew we had 41 poseidon subs</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">later traded in for</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">what was it 18 or 20 tridents so i was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">nuclear war nerd</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">but even i more or less had forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">that these things were out there</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">until i read your book isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating and not surprising jim</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">we kind of came at this uh be for</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">exactly that reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">that that we perceive as you do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">people have largely forgotten about</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">nuclear weapons and the nuclear threat</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">and so really our effort here to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">remind people</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">that although the cold war went away uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">and the weapons have declined in number</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">they&#39;re still there</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">the policies that make them dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">are still in place and so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">bring some new attention to these issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">to try to make them safer yet jim not</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">only the nuclear weapons still there</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">but in my judgment in tom&#39;s judgment the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">of a nuclear catastrophe today is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">actually higher than it was during the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">cold war higher than during the time you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">had doctor under the desk</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">and the that adds a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">note of dangerous situation and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">really motivated tom and me</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">on an education program in which this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">book is a part</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">and actually it makes sense you know as</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">a former corporate executive i know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">what you pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">your organizations tend to do pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">well but i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">if nuclear weapons are you know not in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">front and center of attention well</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">obviously they are the people who run</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">the programs</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s quite possible that the operations</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t nearly as first class as they</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">were during the cold war which</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">by itself raises risks and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">later about shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">personnel risks associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">current epoch</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">before we get into those risks though</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">let&#39;s maybe inform our audience a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">bit about where we stand</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">today you know i talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">thousand-minute men and the 54 titans</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">41 poseidons and all that stuff what do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">our strategic</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">nuclear forces look like today well just</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">to give a brief overview</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">both the united states and russia are</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">abiding by</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">something called the new start treaty</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">this was negotiated between the united</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">states and russia during the obama</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">administration</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">and it limits both sides to about 1550</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">strategic deployed nuclear weapons and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">by that i mean the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">out in service on a day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">basis so that&#39;s 1550</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">but there are other ones there are other</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">ones that are not counted</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">uh by that treaty that are in storage uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">and held in reserve</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">so we would say there&#39;s about on each</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">000 nuclear weapons still today with</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">another 2 000 or so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">uh in in reserve or or in queue for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">retirement</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a long way from the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">where both sides had in excess of 30</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">000 nuclear weapons so we&#39;ve come a long</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">but from our perspective uh it only</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">takes a few hundred to destroy the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">and we have real dangers of accidental</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">launch</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">that could result in nuclear use so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">have we have some distance yet to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">yep and then we should also note that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">there are a lot more nuclear powers</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">these days than there were</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">during the height of the cold war at</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">least you know we had uk and france back</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">in those days and china</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">but now we have israel and india and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">pakistan</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">and a source of mind swears that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">switzerland has had nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">since 1962</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not but</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">he swears it and unless they&#39;re crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">the japanese and taiwanese likely have</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">quickly assembled nuclear kits</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">so we live in a multi-polar nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">world where the game theory in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">could get pretty damn complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">now the other thing that you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">in your book which i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">i suppose i knew this but again i had</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">allowed it to slip into the background</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">is that the president of the united</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">remains the sole command authority for</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">our nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">could you all comment upon that a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">bit this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">one of the most dangerous aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">current situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">the president and the president alone</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">can order a nuclear strike</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">he can do it for it any reason or with</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">no reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">he can consult with others but he does</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">not need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">he can consider for two hours to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">consider for two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">in any event if he decides to launch</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no legal way of stopping him</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">from doing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">this is i think a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">situation particularly since our forces</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">are deployed</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">so that it can quickly be quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">launched in other words if the president</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">decides to launch a nuclear weapon</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">they can be off in the air in a matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">of a few minutes and then if he changes</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">his mind or if he gets decide the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">information that he had was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of calling them back</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re on the way you cannot call them</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">you cannot destroy them in flight you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">will have started a nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">yeah and i think that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">for people to realize you know again as</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">a somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">at least a hobbyist level student i knew</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">there was no call back button for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">obvious reason right that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">awful valuable target for somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">to capture but we should realize that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">the balloon ever goes up there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">calling it back which means that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">to think through these policies</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">because the risks are really high you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">also point out in your book that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">of the air force and presumably the navy</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">kind of reinforce this you talk about an</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">officer herring who during his training</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">in the air force as a nuclear missile</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">launch officer</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">asked his instructors how can i be</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">certain that any launch order i receive</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">comes from a sane president rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">provide an</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">answer to his questions the air force</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">simply fired him</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right jim i mean i think in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">air force there&#39;s an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">that rules and orders shall be followed</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">so i know that some people think that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">a president</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">say president trump were to make an</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">order of nuclear launch</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">that seemed unreasonable that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">might be someone in the military chain</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">of command that would choose not to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">follow that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">order to me that is not reassuring at</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">uh one because the military culture is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">to follow orders</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">but two you know that shouldn&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">insurance policy that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">that we have for ourselves if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">feel that a president</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">is capable or qualified to make a launch</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">all by himself uh then we need to change</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">the policy</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re certainly using president</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">trump here</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">to highlight the dangers of sole</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want to single him out he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">not the only one</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">there have been other presidents for</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">example president nixon</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">who was known to be drinking very</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">heavily at the end of his term</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">uh and as well as president reagan</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">who was known to have dementia at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">end of his term and even president</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">kennedy who was known to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">taking heavy pain medications at certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">so certain presidents at certain times</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">have shown behaviors that we would think</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">would give us cause for concern</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">about giving this much authority to one</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">and this is a great example of a policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">that should have changed at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">that is 30 years ago but we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">really taken the time to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">and say you know we had all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">policies like sole presidential</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">authority in the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">which may or may not have made sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">then but they certainly don&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">now uh we&#39;re in a very different day the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">risks are very different the dangers are</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">why do we still have these policies well</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">primarily because we&#39;ve never taken the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">to go back and look at them uh and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">it&#39;s high time that we did because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">risks are just too great</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">yeah and i would also add as people</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">listen to the show know i often describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">as a madisonian as in james madison the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">chief architect of our constitution</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">and what i loved about him was despite</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.399" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">being a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">unlike most revolutionaries he was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">very cynical guy</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">he knew that human nature was weak and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">variable</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">and inevitably we would elect somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">not suitable for the job in fact in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">book you quote general maxwell</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">taylor as to those dangers arising from</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">irrational american president the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">protection is not to elect one</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">well james madison would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">inevitable that we will elect one</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">so it seems to me amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">irresponsible that we still have</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">a command and control system based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">that we won&#39;t elect one you know again</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:29.040" style="s2">just from an</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">american history of constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.040" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">theory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">and jim since you raised the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">constitution let me just say that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">know the constitution says that congress</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">shall declare war</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">uh not the president and clearly if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">president uses nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">first on his own authority without</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">consulting congress</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">we would say that is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.800" style="s2">declaration of war</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">so we see presidential sole authority as</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.800" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">unconstitutional</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">as well as as extremely dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">for both reasons would like to see it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">fixed</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">and you mentioned in passing something</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">that i noticed in your book and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">again vaguely recall this but again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">not front and center this nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">amnesia is a real thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">i hope your book wakes people up from</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">and that is the united states has not</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">yet renounced first use of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">you know obama considered doing so but</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">he never did</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">why is that and should we renounce first</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">the answer the second question is yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">the first question</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">every administration when summoned into</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">office prepares what&#39;s called a nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">posture review in which it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:37.920" style="s2">thinks through reconsiders and delivers</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.920" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">nuclear policy one of those every new</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">administration is considered</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">no first use and when i was a secretary</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">of defense from the clinton</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">administration</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">we had a very serious consideration of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">it and we were close to deciding it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">in our case the tipping factor against</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">was that two of our allies two of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">people to whom we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">provided what&#39;s called extended</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">deterrence objected</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">they felt that that would weaken the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">guarantee we&#39;d made to them that we will</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">come to their aid if they&#39;re attacked</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">so for whatever reason it has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">considered by each administration</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">and each time it has been rejected in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">the case of the clinton administration</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">and obama administration</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">it was a very close call now there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">a new opportunity perhaps in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">january for the president then to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">reconsider you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">go through their nuclear policy with you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">a very appropriate time</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">this time to make the right decision and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">to decide in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">having and no first years i might say</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a matter of declaring</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">no first use for it to have any meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">you have to change your policies and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">and your procedures to make that evident</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re not going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">europeans first now for one thing having</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">forces deployed so they can be launched</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">in a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">is not consistent with the new first use</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">yes and also having a single</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">command authority weakens you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">belief in the credibility of that claim</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">as well you know if it had to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">you know the president and two</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">congressional leaders</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">that would make the statement more</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">credible it would seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">exactly jim can i do that a word here</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">absolutely uh no first use i mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">real paradox of history that we still</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">have the u.s possibility the first use</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">of nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard to imagine a president</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">ever exercising</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">that authority the only time the united</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">states used nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">first of course was was you know world</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">ii in japan and hiroshima and nagasaki</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">uh no president has used nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">since and there&#39;s a good reason for this</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">is their presidents</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">really sort of just are repelled by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">of nuclear use and particularly first</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">uh you know any first use of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">weapons particularly against another</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">nuclear weapons state</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">would bring destruction upon the united</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">and for the president who would unleash</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">create a reputation for them in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">history books that they certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">remembered for so from our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">we can&#39;t imagine a rational president</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">using nuclear weapons first so then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">question is why do presidents</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">not get rid of this authority well part</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">of it is that you know presidents don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">like to give up any authority</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">that they have but in this case i would</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">say it has a lot to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">that presidents haven&#39;t been willing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">spend the political capital</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">because it would be a heavy lift to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">that policy announcement</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">uh and then go out and seek american and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">international support</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">for that a president would have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">some time doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">i would have to spend some political</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">capital getting it done</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the reasons why president</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">obama considered it</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">and then turned away it wasn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">he didn&#39;t believe in no first use</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">it was because he wanted to spend his</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">time doing other things and it was going</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">to be something that was hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">so this is part of the reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">feel we need american public support</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">for these policies and that presidents</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">at least it&#39;s not absurd germany it just</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">seems absurd right</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">well i mean again you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to us why</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">weapons uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re in a major crisis situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">uh we will come to your defense</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">that isn&#39;t a commitment to use nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a commitment to come to your aid</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">weapons but nowhere in there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">promise for the first use of nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">and i frankly can&#39;t imagine that our</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">allies would consider a threat to use</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">nuclear weapons first</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">as even credible or that they would want</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">it because then we would be introducing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">nuclear weapons into</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">their region uh first and and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">escalating what could then turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">be a broad widespread nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">and that makes good sense even if it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t become widespread i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">you&#39;re germany do you really want</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">nukes landing on your territory i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">now you know first use is certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">bad thing but let&#39;s now get on to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">one that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">scary and you know as a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">played quite a bit with game theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">and simulations of prisoners dilemma and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">things of this sort as i focused on</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">this my hair stood up on the back of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">neck and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">is the danger of launch on warning</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">could you explain to our audience what</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">that is and to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">does that potential still exist today</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:15.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it still exists today launch on</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">warning means</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">that if our command system detects</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">a launch underway against us</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">then their concern is that that launch</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">undoubtedly directed at our icbms in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">their silos</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">and their thought was we want to launch</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">our icbms before this lands</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">now considering the flight time of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">missile coming from say russia to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">there&#39;s not much time to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">from the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">the missiles launched at the time they</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">detected it can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">five six seven minutes at the time that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">they actually get the word through the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">command through to the president</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">the order&#39;s due to the president then</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">that can be another couple of minutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">it comes down the president will have</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">about five six seven minutes</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">to decide to launch once he gets this</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">warning so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">launch on warning means if he gets a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">warning</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">then an attack on the united states is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">underway then he&#39;s going to launch his</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">missiles in a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">so that they will not be destroyed in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">the silos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the thesis it assumes</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">it assumes that russia is launching</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">a surprise attack against the united</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">states specifically for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">taking out</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">our icbms and this is the threat that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">now the assumption i think is is insane</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">uh there&#39;s no way i can believe that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">russia would see any</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">any advantage of that if they did it uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">it would surely lead to their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">i met many russians in my time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">including all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">leaders of russia and one thing like two</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">things i can say with great confidence</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">is versus the russians are not stupid</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">and secondly the russians are not</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">suicidal therefore they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">be doing that so we have a policy</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s based on really an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">assumption namely that the russians are</p>

<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">you know the argument that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">irrational it&#39;s you know i agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">and the bolt from the blue theory has</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">you know sort of a preemptive strike</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">rather than losing their capabilities i</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">mean in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:58.039" style="s2">people can make strange decisions you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">know i remind people of july</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.039" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">1914. that was the argument made during</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">the cold war and perhaps it made some</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">sense then</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">even if it made sense then it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">does not make sense today</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">and the second point is that even if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">believe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">remote likelihood of russia making a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">surprise attack against us</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">and you say that&#39;s something we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">the provisions we make for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">put us in a position where we are highly</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">vulnerable to launching by mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">and so you have to weigh which of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">two dangers is more realistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">the danger the russia is going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">surprise attack on us</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">or the danger because of the policies</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve set up our lunch on warning our</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">quick launch policy that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">have blunder into a nuclear war we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">going to have a launch by accident</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s of course the key point that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">you guys make later in the book which</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">that okay what are the risks of some</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">real crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">and again post-cold war probably small</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">but all the risk of error is still there</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">you know one of the things we did with</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">the book is is we we put in a preface</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">where we tried to lay out what we saw as</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">the doomsday</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">scenario uh of of things that could</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">happen with our existing</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">policies and that is that there could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">a cyber attack right and most people</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">don&#39;t realize that our nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">systems command and control systems are</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">networked are based on computers and are</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">vulnerable to cyber attack</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">so imagine for a moment that that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">was a cyber attack by some</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">adversary who manipulated our</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">early warning systems to show that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">was a nuclear attack</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">underway against the united states from</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">russia</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">and the president would be given just</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">five minutes to decide</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">whether to launch a nuclear response or</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">and that the pressure to launch a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">response is increased by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">land-based ballistic missiles icbms</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">that are in the ground vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">attack</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">and so the advisors might say look mr</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t launch within the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">we are going to lose our our land-based</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">ballistic missiles</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">and this is the use them or lose them</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">that increases the pressure on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">president to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">to launch but of course realize back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">the launch on warning</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">posture that we were discussing before</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">if the president decides to launch</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">that would be before the incoming attack</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">if it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">would have landed and so the president</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know at that point whether the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">attack is false</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">or real and one of the main things we</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">want to get across</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">in the book is that if there is an alarm</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">of a possible attack</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">the president because of the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">of false alarms which we&#39;ve had before</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">cyber attacks on our commanding control</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">the president really has to assume that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">any warning an</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">attack is false until proven otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">and the president cannot rationally</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">launch a retaliation</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">until he knows that the attack is real</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">and so the main thing we want to do here</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">give the president more decision time</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">take away the options that allow for</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">quick</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">decisions and quick launch because that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">is how we will blunder into nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">and start nuclear war by mistake</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">jim i want to remind you and your</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">listeners that when we first built</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.880" style="s2">our long-range missiles or icbms we put</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">them in silos</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.880" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">and the reason we put them in silos is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">that we wanted to protect them</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">from a surprise attack and back when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">were building those</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">missiles in those silos the silos did</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">protect them in attack</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">because an attacker had to make a direct</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">hit on the silo and neither they</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">in order to take the missiles the silos</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">are built lots of concrete and still</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">they&#39;re very difficult to destroy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">for many decades</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">missiles were invulnerable in the silos</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">but technology moves on what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">since then</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">is that both first united states and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">then russia developed</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">the guidance the technology the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">government guided systems that are so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">accurate</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">that they can destroy the silos even</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">though they have all this concrete stone</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">so what was it the ninja originally an</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">invulnerable basing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">of the site in the silos now has become</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">highly vulnerable basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">in effect our icbms are sitting ducks</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">waiting to be shut down</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">though i think just to be fair it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">true that as i recall one of the new</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">start provisions is we got rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">mervs which</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">really made the game theory of use it or</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">lose it</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">high stakes so with only single warheads</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">on the missiles they&#39;re unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">able to take all of our icbms out</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">well our point here is that it it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">um we don&#39;t need icbms for deterrence</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">we have weapons on invulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">submarines based at sea</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t need icbms for</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">deterrence and all they do</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">for us frankly is create this false</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">alarm</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">stumble into nuclear war danger so one</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">of the recommendations we make in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">is that we should get rid of our icbms</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t need them at all we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">them for deterrence because the subs</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">are out there and they create the false</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">history of the issue in your book</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">you guys state that both reagan and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">carter</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">remained ambiguous about whether their</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">policy was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">launched on warning hinting that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">probably wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">but they believed that the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">ambiguity was useful</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">we then get to bush and obama and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">talked about that it was morally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">to be at launch on warning and yet once</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">they got in office</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">neither of them actually took the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">missiles off alert</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">could you say a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">history and again the dynamics on</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">why we&#39;re still here where we are 40</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">years after the end of the cold war i</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">think a lot of it goes down to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">back to this paradox that i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">about which is that presidents</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">want the flexibility to threaten</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">to use nuclear weapons first but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">don&#39;t actually want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">um there&#39;s this there&#39;s this old phrase</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">that the united states uses all the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">which are</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">all options are on the table right if</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">someone ever says well how about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">united states respond militarily in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">the response is all options are on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">table and that is a veiled nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">threat what that&#39;s saying is we might</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">use nuclear weapons without using those</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">exact words</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">and if you have a no first use policy</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">all of a sudden your</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">threat to use nuclear weapons first uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">is less credible</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">but the argument i would make is that a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">u.s threat to use nuclear weapons first</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">is already not credible we haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">it in 75 years</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">no rational president would do it he</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">would either invite nuclear retaliation</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">against the united states</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">or make the united states into nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">pariah attacking a non-nuclear state</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just a step that no president would</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s time for a president to sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">of cash in the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">of announcing a no first use policy</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">which in in our view would be reducing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">the chances</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">of blundering into nuclear war because</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">we think that the russians uh do believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">that the united states could launch a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">surprise attack against them</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">and therefore they&#39;re on the hair</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">trigger uh in a way that makes it much</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">more dangerous for us because there</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">could be a mistaken launch</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">from russia because of their hair</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">trigger</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">status so both sides would be safer if</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">we moved away</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">from earth use uh and we certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">see any realistic process that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">united states would ever benefit from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.279" style="s2">first use</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">jim i want to add i want to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.279" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">that even</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">if a president sees some benefit to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">these policies</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">he has to consider what am i paying for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the loss what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">what&#39;s the risk in these policies and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">the point of our book is to convince him</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">that the risk</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">is that it increases the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">an accidental war it increases the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">you&#39;re going to blunder into nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">and we think that is the more likely</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">consideration</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">and that he has to have that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">whatever benefits he thinks he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">from not going</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">no first use whatever benefits he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">he&#39;s getting from having our missiles on</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">on a quick launch and allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">launch on warning to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a cost to that and the cost is</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">an increased risk</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">of blundering into a nuclear war and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">that to me is the real danger we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">facing in the world today</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s a perfect time because i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">about to move into your chapter</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">titled blundering into nuclear war it</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">was hair raising</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">you opened it up with a description of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">the hawaiian</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">faults alarm that we recently had could</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">one of you guys to run that through for</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">our audience</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">tom why did you do the hawaiian and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">i&#39;ll follow up with my own</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">experience with false alarms sure uh you</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">having talked to people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">lived through this in hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">it was quite terrifying um it was an</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">otherwise beautiful day</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">in an otherwise beautiful place on</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">and then people started getting these</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">text messages on their</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">cell phones uh saying that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">incoming</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">missile strike and this was right at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">when people were very concerned uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">that north korea might attack the united</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">states this was this was at the time of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">fire and fury</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">where president trump uh was exchanging</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">uh sort of escalatory words</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">with kim jong-un from north korea</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">about whose nuclear button was bigger</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">and it was a scary time</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">and it was right in the middle of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">that this uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">false alarm came through in hawaii where</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.039" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">people really thought</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">that they were um about to get attacked</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">with nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">and so they for you know a good part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">an hour scurried around</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">trying to find their loved ones and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">trying to find shelter</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">until it was finally declared that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">was a false alarm</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">and so the main point here is that false</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">alarms</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">are real uh they do happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">luckily that was not a false alarm</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">situation that went to the central</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">command</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">or to the president of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">but it could have</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">and so the question is if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">false alarm that actually goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">what does the president do and it&#39;s our</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">quickly happily he quickly went on that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">he had concluded it was a false alarm</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">so that was that that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">clear indelible impression on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">of the danger of lunch on warning</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">because of the possibility of falsehood</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">we have had the total of between</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">ourselves and russia five false alarms</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">that i am aware of</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">could happen because of human error</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">they happen because machine era humans</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">do air and machines do air so it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">and the question is what do we do about</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">it and the answer in our mind is we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">away from this quick launch that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">launched on warning</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">possibly which could lead us all into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">nuclear disaster absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">though of course again to be fair and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">honest we would not have launched on</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">warning in the hawaiian case because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">just thought to be the north koreans and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">probably two or three missiles and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">know we can absorb that hit and still</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">knock the out of them if we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">jim i just want to say the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">for bringing up the wine is not because</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">that was a real danger of a fault of a</p>

<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">just just to remind people the the false</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">alarms can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">indeed and i i understood that i was</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:59.599" style="s2">just clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">the point that the two issues of false</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.599" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">alarm and launch on warning while</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">in that particular case weren&#39;t linked</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">now as you go into this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">section of your book you basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">divide the categories of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">errors that could lead to blundering</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">three categories one actually what do</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">you guys talk about the three categories</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">hell it&#39;s your book you can do a better</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">job than i can i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">well first of all we can have a false</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">we can have a mistaken launch an</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">accidental launch</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">in response to a false alarm we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">already talked about that in some way</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">you can also have a nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">blundering a nuclear war by a political</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">miscalculation</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">the process of a child in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">replica for a political miscalculation</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">is the cuban missile crisis where</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">neither president kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">nor president kakusha wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">awards were doing everything they could</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">to prevent us nuclear women we almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">plundered into one</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">because of bad information that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">president has had</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">lack of information in the first case</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">but what some of the information he had</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">was actually bet</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">for example well after the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">president kennedy said that he thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">he thought there&#39;s about one chance in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">three that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">cuban missile crisis would result in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">nuclear catastrophe one chance and three</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">where the outcome would be basically the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">destruction of a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">but when he said that he wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">aware of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">that besides the medium-range missiles</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">russians had deployed in cuba not yet</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">operational</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">they also had tactical nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">in cuba they were operational and ready</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">to go with the warheads</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:41.599" style="s2">and so if kennedy had accepted the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">unanimous recommendation of his joint</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.599" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">chiefs of staff</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">for a military attack on cuba a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">conventional military attack on cuba</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">our troops were met on the beachhead</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">when decimated on the beachhead</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">with the nuclear weapons and the general</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">nuclear war would surely have followed</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">so this in my mind is an example of how</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">you can blunder into a war through a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">political miscalculation in this case</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">mainly through bad information and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">as we&#39;ve discussed this very briefly</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a possibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">lapse of rationality on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">president trump&#39;s already mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">the case historical cases which give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.320" style="s2">some concern about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">the most dramatic one being the last few</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.320" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">months of nixon&#39;s presidency</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">very heavily drinking sometimes at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">point of being not fully competent</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">now at that time the then secretary of</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">was so concerned so concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">policy whether nixon might do something</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">that he called the general the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">air command and told him</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">do not take any action if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">launch order</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">from the president check with me first</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing for him to say that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">reflects how concerned he was but in</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">fact he had no legal authority for doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:53.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.440" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">the general would have followed his</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">guidance the general would undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">instead take instructions from the</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">yeah and we have a situation like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">today at least we may well have</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">and it highlights these risks that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">talking about so you had a recap for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">audience basically three categories you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">incomplete information like in the cuban</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">you could have a unstable or even insane</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">or you could have what we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">earlier you know cyber attacks</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">failed 46 chips etc that are providing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">false information</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">and you know all three of those are ways</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">that you know if the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">signal were dire enough we actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">literally could stumble into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">full-fledged nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">at least so long as we have launch on</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">warning as our policy</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">at any time that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">jim if i could just add to that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t have to be that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">is not capable all of the time it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">their president might not be up to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">for one five-minute period out of their</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">entire four years in office</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">right because you never know when this</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">alarm will happen when there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">false alarm</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">the president would have five minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s that five minutes that concerns</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">right is the president in a bad mood</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">during that five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">has the president been drinking uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">during that five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s in a crucial five</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">minutes and you want him and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of what underlies our</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">working assumption here that that no</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">president uh i don&#39;t care which one it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">is from history</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">no matter how great they were no</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">president can be counted on to make that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">kind of decision at any moment at any</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s just too much responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">put on one</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">fallible human being and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">certainly no reason why</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">we still do it we simply don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">understand it and just to add to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">historical</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">uh case you know we tend to think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">presidents have perfect information</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">um that they always have the up-to-date</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">information to know what&#39;s going on but</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">you know as as bill talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">case of the cuban missile crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">uh it&#39;s simply not true and another</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">story i would just add here which i</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">just only discovered in the course of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">writing the book was when</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">president truman was considering using</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">against japan the historical record</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">certainly strongly implies that he</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">didn&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">that hiroshima was a city and not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.119" style="s2">in his mind might have been a military</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.119" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">he didn&#39;t understand the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">civilians</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">that were involved and therefore that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">actually most of the casualties of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">hiroshima would be civilian and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">military so we have a number of examples</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">where presidents are</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">grossly misinformed and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">is that the kind of situation that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">want to put a president into to make a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">decision of that magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">on such short notice let that be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">warning to us all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">before we turn to what we should do in</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">some detail</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">let&#39;s update the current state of play</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">and things</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">nuclear you know in your book you call</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">out the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">one big decision that was made in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">early part of the century</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">was us withdrawing from the abm treaty</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">you know we say it&#39;s for defense against</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">north korea or iran</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">and the russians assume the worst what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">been the result of that with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">the nuclear posture of the u.s and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">russia</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">well jim great point um you know the abm</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">treaty just so the listeners understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">was negotiated by the nixon</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">administration</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">way back in 1972 with russia</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">and it basically said that neither</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">would deploy a nationwide defense</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">against nuclear attack now that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">to most people to be counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">right why would you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">uh prohibit yourself from deploying a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">defense</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">well the reason is is that at the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">and i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">still today we don&#39;t have the technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">to make a missile defense effective</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">now you can still deploy one and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">the united states has</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">uh deployed missile defenses but that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to work</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">and what happens is certainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">russian case</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">the way that the russians respond is</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">that they will leave themselves enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">margin to have enough offensive missiles</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">to overwhelm any defenses we deploy</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">and so what this has done is created a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">floor</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">below which the russians simply are much</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">more resistant to reduce their nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">so we are in a situation now where</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">russia is resisting</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">reducing nuclear weapons that pose a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">uh and present danger to the united</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">because we&#39;ve deployed missile defenses</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">that in our view</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">don&#39;t work and wouldn&#39;t be effective</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">against that threat</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">and the reason we did this is politics</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">right it&#39;s very hard to or</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">argue with the american people we shall</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">remain defenseless</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">we shall not build missile defenses but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">the reality is that that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">should do</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">because the technology doesn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">by deploying them</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve only increased the nuclear forces</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">uh aimed against us or</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">i should say prevented russia from going</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">as far</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">as they might otherwise go with nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">reductions</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">jim i want to elaborate on one point</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">here policy missile defense systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">do work in the sense that if a missile</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">is fired</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">at the united states we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">have a missile defense intercept to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">after and have a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">of hitting it but that&#39;s assuming</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">a single warhead but our system or any</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">such system can be saturated you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">more than</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">one maybe five or ten or a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">we have no possibility of defending</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">against a mass attack like that and to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">further elaborate that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">even in a country like north korea which</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">does not have that many</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">missiles to attack us with they can put</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">t coils up as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">and the system we have is vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">to decoys so launching if north korea</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">say could launch</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">five or ten missiles at it it would look</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">it could look to the fence system like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">500 or a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">and so any defense system can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">saturated</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">and this system is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">susceptible to saturation because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">so easy and simple</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">to build realistic looking decoys</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">for an intercept that&#39;s going to occur</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">in outer space which is where our system</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">sorry about getting into a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">technical detail on that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">important to understand that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">just that our system</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">wasn&#39;t designed right it&#39;s just every</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">system in that sort is capable of being</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">saturated</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">being defeated by being saturated and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to saturate with putting</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">decoys</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">along with your missiles yep and i love</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">you make that point i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">i as a you know civilian nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">hobbyist in the 1980s did a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">of math and realized</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">that mid-course abm could never work for</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">exactly that reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">you know in space where there&#39;s no air</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">drag to separate a heavy warhead from a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">you know a light mylar balloon they both</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">move at the same speed</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">the opportunity to out decoy is always</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">going to dominate the ability</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">to knock down missiles in the mid-course</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">i mean at launch you have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">take them out and terminally you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">chance to take them out</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m frankly amazed that a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">smart folks</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">who made the decision to proceed with</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">mid-course interception</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t do the simple math and realized</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">that it was an impossible</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">project that&#39;s the fundamental point</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">and i would elaborate on that point by</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">saying that the tactical missile defense</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">systems we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">which defend our troops in the theater</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">at the terminal end of the in support</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">where that&#39;s no longer no longer true so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">we do have</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">effective missile defense systems in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">tactical field</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">but as long as our strategic systems the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">ones that defend against the icbm attack</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">as long as they&#39;re designed to operate</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">in outer space they will be highly</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">susceptible to decoys</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">for the reason you describe yep and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">while terminal defense is</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">at least theoretically possible we had</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">the what was it the sprint system at one</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">point that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">a terminal defense system i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">whatever became of that my calculations</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">in 1985</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">said that&#39;s at least possible unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">mid course which is just a fool&#39;s errand</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">and yet nonetheless how many billions of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">dollars did we spend on it a shitload</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">as far as i can recall let&#39;s see moving</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">on to other current events before we</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">turn</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">to what to do about it the russians seem</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">rather blatantly violating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">intermediate-range nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">forces treaty the inf treaty so-called</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">and they&#39;ve also oddly i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">this is about have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">violating the open skies treaty and has</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">basically pushed the u.s to withdraw</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">from open skies</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">what are the russians up to why are they</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.839" style="s2">doing this and what does it mean for our</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">strategic posture</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.839" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">the russians have been bad actors in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">many respects i think even more</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.880" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">importantly</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">is the bad actions in ukraine but on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">other hand the russians also have</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">4 000 nuclear weapons of which 1550 are</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:15.760" style="s2">deployed</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">and presumably muslim deployed against</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.760" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">so we have they&#39;re the only country in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">the world as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">one of their commentators once said on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">russian television</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">that can turn the united states into</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">radioactive ash</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s a reality we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">the russians</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s so hard to do them is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">because their actions are so bad in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">other fields</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">so the the only solution i can see to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">is we have to be able to separate out</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">those two variables we have to separate</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">the bad actions in one field from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">strategic nuclear field where we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">common interests</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">the common interest not to have a</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">not to have nuclear terrorism so we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">that we can deal with them and should be</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">dealing with them in the nuclear field</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">if we can only get that decoupled from</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">the bad behavior in other fields which</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">we rightly uh poor</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">of course the inf violations are coupled</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">to the nuclear posture and that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">threaten our</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">core allies in europe and as at least as</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">about why is he doing this</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why he&#39;s doing it but i can</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">tell you that our response to that which</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to build the same weapons is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">not a good response either for russia or</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">we need to find a way of getting back to</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">ever agreed to and giving that up was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">so whatever they&#39;re doing in that field</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">whatever the motivation they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">for doing that we need to find a way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">getting back and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">discussing and debating this with them</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">and see if we can find a way again</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">getting this situation because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">bad result both for russia</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">and the united states and therefore that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">gives us a basis i think for negotiating</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">yeah i would hope so because you know at</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">least it seems to me unless we can get</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">past this inf</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">issue it doesn&#39;t seem to be any hope for</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">renegotiating the new start treaty which</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">expires next year i believe and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">been a cornerstone of our nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">you know strategic nuclear arms control</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">can you talk a little bit about where</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">new start is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">and what do you think is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">well on you start i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">the good news is that the inf fallout uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">has not</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">infected the new start situation quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">so much there&#39;s been no</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">evidence of russian cheating or u.s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">cheating for that matter on new start so</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">you know that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">to the good but the new start treaty</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">expires</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">next february and it can be extended</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">unconditionally for about up to five</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">and so we strongly support uh that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">trump administration</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">should work with russia to extend new</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">uh for up to five years unconditionally</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">and that could be done right</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">now because russia has been very clear</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">that they support the unconditional</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">extension of the treaty</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">unfortunately the trump administration</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">has been dragging its heels</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">and has been not willing to support a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">a unconditional extension and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">has been putting conditions</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">i would say unrealistic conditions on</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">the extension uh first you know they</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">china to be part of of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">any uh follow-on treaty or extension</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">china has basically said no to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">because they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">so much fewer nuclear weapons than the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">united states and russia</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">uh about one-tenth or fewer nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">weapons than</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">than we do that they made the argument</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s just not realistic</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">for china to be involved in this point</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">uh and the trump administration seems to</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">have accepted that point</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">but the trump station is still asking</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">changes to the new star treaty in terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">of the weapons it covers</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">um or the inspection procedures now you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">simply can&#39;t extend new start and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">change it at the same time if you change</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">the treaty then you have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">the senate</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">and get a new ratification which we</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">so the simple thing to do here is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">extend new start without any changes</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">a clean extension as they say for up to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">five years and then once you have that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">go try to negotiate which we fully</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">support a follow-on treaty</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:40.160" style="s2">that could have better verification it</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">could go after</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.160" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">a wider range of nuclear weapons for</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">shorter-range nuclear weapons that both</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">the united states and russia have that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">are not captured by the current treaty</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">uh we support that too and eventually to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">talk with</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">china uh although again their numbers</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">are so so much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">that it&#39;s not clear that they have an</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">incentive to get involved at this point</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">but the key thing is that either the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">trump administration or</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">if if vice president biden wins the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">election in november</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">uh the buy administration move very</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">quickly to extend new start so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">maintain</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">limitations on long-range nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">weapons and then move to negotiate a new</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:20.319" style="s2">follow-on agreement</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">if we move forward the way trump</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.319" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">describes</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">there is a way of dealing with the china</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">issue which is we could invite</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:29.920" style="s2">china to sit in as an observer to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">new to the new start follow on</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.920" end="00:52:35.119" style="s2">2d talks and then at such time as we get</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">closer to them in the number of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">then they can ease in to become regular</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">part of the negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">but being part of the negotiation today</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">that makes no sense even for the next</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">few years but we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">be able to have them in the city as</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">observers so if we reach a stage</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">where their missiles get large enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">for our missiles get small enough that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">then they&#39;d be able to move right into</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">the talks with us okay well i think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">have set the stage of where we are today</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">and you guys have hinted at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">solutions let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">down to it what should we do as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">to address these various risks that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">lurking out there and which frankly most</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">of us aren&#39;t even aware that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">about what should we do well uh jim i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">kick it off and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">uh bill will we&#39;ll follow on you know i</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">our highest recommendation is that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">should increase the amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">that a president has to make a launch</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">decision uh that we&#39;re in real danger</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">of rushing the president into a decision</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">uh that could be in response to a false</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">alarm that will lead us to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">blunder into a nuclear war that is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">highest</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">potential danger that we see to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">united states right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t see a great danger of an</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">intentional nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">because that would be suicidal for both</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">the united states and russia</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">but we do see a great danger in in</p>

<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">bumbling into nuclear war by mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">there&#39;s three key</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">things that we would like to see happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">to increase the amount of time that a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">president has</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">of the blue and it would be nice if</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">russia responded to that reciprocated in</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">policy more credible is</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">to retire the weapons that we would use</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">in a first launch situation</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:11.520" style="s2">and to us the the first weapons that a</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">president would reach to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.520" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">uh particularly in a false alarm</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">scenario would be the land-based</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">ballistic missiles because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">uh to first strike they&#39;re vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">being destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">quickly so and as we&#39;ve said before we</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">don&#39;t need those weapons for deterrence</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">we have submarine weapons that can do</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">that uh so we would seek</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">to retire the land-based</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">ballistic missiles and now is a great</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">time to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">because the air force just last week</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">agreed to a contract with northrop</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">grumman</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:47.680" style="s2">which is a down payment on a new uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">generation of land-based ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.680" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">missiles these missiles will cost</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">the taxpayer upwards of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">and that is money we would much rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">see spent on higher priority</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">threats to united states for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">the coronavirus or addressing climate</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">uh or fixing racial injustice these are</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">the things that our nation should be</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">worried about</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">uh and we shouldn&#39;t be spending that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">money on weapons that we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">all right a good concise statement now</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">how do we do them let&#39;s think about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">details</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">how do we go from soul authority to some</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">kind of multi-key authority</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">as i understand it at least the soviets</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still the russian</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">doctrine but the soviets had some kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">three-key system didn&#39;t they something</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">like that bill</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">yes they did they had it both tactically</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">and strategically</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">for example during the cuban missile</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">they nuclear the soviets had submarines</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">uh out patrolling the area</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">and their submarines had unknown to us</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">that submarines had</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">nuclear torpedoes and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">three-key system before they could be</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">launched that&#39;s a damn good thing they</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s one of those submarines</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">came under attack</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">i thought it was under attack from one</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">of our destroyers</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">and he was getting ready to torpedo that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">destroyer the skipper was but he could</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">not get the other two to agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">that would surely have caused a general</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">and so we just missed that one by a hair</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">so they had this three key system then</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">for the tactical system maybe still</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">and they also had a three-key system for</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:25.839" style="s2">their strategic weapons</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">we understand that today although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.839" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">hard to be certain about this but we</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">understand that they have abandoned that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">for the strategic weapons</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">and then now president putin has the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">sole authority just as president trump</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:39.359" style="s2">in the united states he&#39;s nasty but at</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">least he&#39;s not crazy right</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.359" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">at least we don&#39;t think so so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:44.880" style="s2">we went with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">three key strategic system in the united</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">states who would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">plausible additional signers that would</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">be required and you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">wonderfully today we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">lots of very advanced multi-key</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">cryptography where we could literally</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">impossible for anybody to forge these</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:01.359" style="s2">signatures</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">what are the other two signatures that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.359" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">you think we should add to the president</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">to launch</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">i think for to make any sense jim it has</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">to be from the uh from the congress</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">that it has to be somebody representing</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">the car not somebody that works for</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">reports to the president</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">but somebody in a different branch of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">government and you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">various ways you could have the two</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">leaders at the congress have uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">you want to be bipartisan so that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">takes it up to four</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">so the minimum would be the house</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">majority leader</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">the the leading democrat in the house</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">leading with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">in the senate leading republicans in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">house lead republican center that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">minimally four people and those people</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">then could</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">have to sign off long ago we would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">so we would have a five key system</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">because of our two-party system instead</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">of a three-key system</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">okay and that by itself of course would</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">slow things down quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">of course it would and then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">reason you&#39;re often given for not doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:55.359" style="s2">it where to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">that&#39;s an that&#39;s an advantage of it one</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.359" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">thing we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:58:59.920" style="s2">whoever makes the decision we want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">slow it down we do not want a quick</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">about ending the world as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">let&#39;s think about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">let&#39;s spend a little time into a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">consultation</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">let&#39;s do a little analysis before we</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">if we would if we in russia would</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">and results would be destruction of our</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.839" style="s2">it could be long enough to cause what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">would be approximately what happened 66</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">million years ago when an asteroid hit</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="00:59:59.839" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">killed many of the animals instantly but</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.839" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">the reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">that we had a mass extinction the reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">all the dinosaurs died for example</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">was because of the smoke and so it took</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">it up in the air worked their way into</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">its way into the stratosphere circled</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">the planet and eventually cut off the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:16.720" style="s2">sun long enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">to kill most of the vegetation on earth</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.720" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">yep yeah certainly you know i always</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">figured the number was around 300. we</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">want to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:24.799" style="s2">total number of nukes on earth well</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">below 300</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.799" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t stumble into those</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">kinds of scenarios and we&#39;re a long way</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">from there unfortunately right</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:34.400" style="s2">so a five key system i could see that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">being useful</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.400" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">do we need to eliminate the icbms under</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">that scenario</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">because there&#39;s no first launch</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">capability there&#39;s no insane or drunk</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">president problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">it would certainly take more than six</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">minutes for the five people to decide</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">do we still need to eliminate the icbms</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">and if so why</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">because they are an attractive nuisance</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">and they are so powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">and so vulnerable that they just invite</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.720" style="s2">an attack they&#39;re sitting ducks</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">and for that reason alone i think we</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.720" end="01:01:05.599" style="s2">ought to get rid of them whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">deterrence capability we think we need</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.599" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">however many nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">we think ought to be in the you know in</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">our inventory an arsenal</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">ought to be deployed on submarines and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">obama&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:20.079" style="s2">not on icbms of course there is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">so-called sponge theory which says</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.079" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">oh yeah they&#39;re kind of vulnerable but</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">they&#39;ll suck up and basically just blow</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">up a bunch of empty corners of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">wyoming and north dakota any nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">weapons targeted the united states so</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">for that reason alone</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">having even a very very vulnerable icbm</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">has strategic value well you know jim i</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">think that the sponge theory as you lay</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t make any sense right i</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:45.359" style="s2">mean why would we want to draw a nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">attack</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.359" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">to the united states uh and you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">upper midwest</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">has has really good people and i hate to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">put a nuclear target</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">on their backs particularly when you</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">that you know if there were a nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">attack against the midwest that would</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">not expend</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">all of the nuclear weapons that russia</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">has russia could attack the midwest</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">as well as the coasts uh they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">to make a choice</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.079" style="s2">in that regard uh and so the sponge</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.079" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">you know i think it doesn&#39;t hold up to a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:19.680" style="s2">simple analysis</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">which said we didn&#39;t have the icbms at</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.680" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">would we be worse off and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">no you know if we didn&#39;t have the icbms</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">russia or another country would still be</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:32.839" style="s2">deterred because we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">invulnerable weapons deployed on</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.839" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">submarines at sea</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.559" style="s2">and they can&#39;t attack those weapons if</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">they&#39;re deployed at sea</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">so they simply would not attack us at</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">all which is exactly what we want</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:46.799" style="s2">and so having some sort of nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">sponge or nuclear sink</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.799" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">out in the midwest to me doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">any sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">it unnecessarily draws a nuclear attack</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.520" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">to the united states which to me is is</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">incredibly counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">and justifies land-based ballistic</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">missiles which we don&#39;t need and as we</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">see now</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">are going to cost us 100 billion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">to replace</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:10.240" style="s2">and from a you know game theory</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">perspective can we do it unless the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:13.119" style="s2">russians do it too</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">if we both did it i could see how it</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">makes sense but if the russians still</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">all their icbms and now they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">re-target those that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:23.200" style="s2">headed for the missile fields and put</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.520" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">them on our industrial centers and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:26.480" style="s2">population centers instead</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">you know they now have a quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.480" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">significant advantage</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">i think jim the idea of an advantage is</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">misleading</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:37.280" style="s2">the russians have enough nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">and we have enough nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to choose uh in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">scenario i mentioned to you a while back</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">each side uses 10 of the nuclear forces</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">that&#39;s enough to destroy both countries</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">so we have so many nuclear weapons so</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:54.240" style="s2">many nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:56.079" style="s2">that the idea of advantage doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.240" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">any sense with the over cures</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.079" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">is more than submerged in the quantities</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">of nuclear weapons we have in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:04.799" style="s2">destructive power</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">that they have okay yeah it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.799" end="01:04:07.280" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">let&#39;s go down to the next argument</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.280" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">traditionally for keeping the icbms</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">which is the so-called triad theory</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">that we can&#39;t be sure of the future we</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">think our subs are undetectable</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">maybe they are today but suppose</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">somebody develops an efficient neutrino</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">detector or something and suddenly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">subs are blazing red on the screen from</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">an orbiting satellite is it really</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">prudent to put all of our eggs in</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">basically one basket</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">you know jim back in the 1970s when i</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">was the under secretary of defense</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">for research and engineering we worried</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:41.599" style="s2">a lot about that argument and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">in those days the thing we were worried</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.599" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">about was no neutrinos but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">uh blue-green lasers and satellites</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">detecting them</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.039" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">there&#39;s always been some theory about</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">how we&#39;re going to detect submarines at</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">sea and basically what it comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:57.599" style="s2">major counter-measure approach that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">technology is developing new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.599" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">attacking submarines</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">our technology is developing new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:02.960" style="s2">defending submarines but from back and</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.960" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">but over that 40-year period that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.559" end="01:05:07.680" style="s2">describing the submarines have always</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">had the advantage and i believe they</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.680" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">will continue in the future</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">we cannot relax and say submarines can</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">never be attacked</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">we have to continue to put a major part</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:18.240" style="s2">of our emphasis</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">a major part of our defense emphasis on</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.240" end="01:05:21.039" style="s2">protecting the invulnerability of our</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">submarines</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.039" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">and i think it becomes a technological</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">battle and i think the united states is</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">a pretty good position to win that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">back and forth yeah i mean in addition</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">to a healthy r d</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">program the bill describes we also have</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">an insurance policy uh which is nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">armed bombers</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">so if the subs ever did uh you know if a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">problem did develop with the subs</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">we have the bombers that can be deployed</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">and so the icbms come an insurance</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:52.880" style="s2">policy on an insurance</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">policy uh and a very expensive insurance</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.880" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">at that and one that increases the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:59.359" style="s2">danger of accidental war so i think when</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">you put all that together</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.359" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">it breaks makes a pretty compelling case</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">that that we don&#39;t need them</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">jim i would add to that that if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:08.880" style="s2">going to get rid of our icbms</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:10.799" style="s2">putting all that weight on suddenly not</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.880" end="01:06:13.599" style="s2">only do we have to have a robust</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:15.920" style="s2">robust technological program in it in</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.599" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">the field of anti-submarine warfare</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.920" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">but we probably want to put our bombers</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">on on air alert</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:24.799" style="s2">because if they&#39;re sitting in the bases</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">there&#39;s vulnerables the icbms are</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.799" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">so the disadvantages of an airborne</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">alert which is why we don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">but we did it for good many years during</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">the cold war so it can be done</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">yep that was the old having a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">wings of them up in the air at all times</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">i remember those days</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">they&#39;re not good days i hope we never</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">have to go back to that but they can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">okay i think you guys have answered the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">objections and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">therefore so order it boom all right</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">let&#39;s hope for the next president is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">sane and reasonable person and reads the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">book and decides to do these things</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:00.960" style="s2">all right this gets us so far but it</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really get us to where we need</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.960" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">the real answer to me seems to be to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">rid of these damn things</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">or at least to build them down to a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">level you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">a hundred worldwide something like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">they&#39;re not an existential threat to our</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">advanced civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">because no matter how careful we are you</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">know think july 1914</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">nobody wanted to go through what they</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.039" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">went through and yet they stumbled into</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">it anyway</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:31.039" style="s2">remember january 1861</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:33.280" style="s2">if anybody had any idea that we were</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.039" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">about to kill the equivalent of six</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.280" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">million</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">contemporary americans the path of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">history would have been very different</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">so how do we really do what gorbachev</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:44.960" style="s2">and reagan</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">talked about doing which is to you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.960" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">either get rid of the nukes or get them</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">down to a level</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">where they&#39;re not an existential threat</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">to advance civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">you know one of the persons with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:57.520" style="s2">reagan and gorbachev reykjavik was</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">george schultz who was secretary of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.520" end="01:08:01.599" style="s2">state at the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">and 20 years on the 20-year anniversary</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:04.960" style="s2">of the reykjavik he convened a small</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">group of us to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.960" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t it time to revisit the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.559" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">just getting rid of the damn things</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">and we agreed and the four of us wrote</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:15.039" style="s2">an op-ed in the wall street journal</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:17.279" style="s2">proposing just that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.039" end="01:08:19.679" style="s2">citing the nuclear dangers and proposing</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.279" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">that we abolish nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.679" end="01:08:22.839" style="s2">and for about four or five years we had</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.839" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">a pretty good run in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">including president obama when he was</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:28.319" style="s2">elected</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">stating in his first foreign policy</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.319" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">address and made in prague right after</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.560" style="s2">just a few months after he took office</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">that he was committing the united states</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">to seek the peace and security of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:40.719" style="s2">world without nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">well he failed on that and he failed i</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.719" end="01:08:43.920" style="s2">think because</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">he could not get support for congress he</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.920" end="01:08:47.839" style="s2">almost couldn&#39;t get new start treaty</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">ratified by the congress and he just</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.839" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">decided he was going to give up it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">worth the effort</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">my view on that is that that is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">solution of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">we tried very hard schultz and kissinger</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:00.159" style="s2">and none of myself to try to promote</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:01.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.159" end="01:09:03.199" style="s2">and after a few years finally gave that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.839" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">up but i think we cannot give up</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.199" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">and so i backed off thinking we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:11.520" style="s2">do that now what can we do now what we</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:14.319" style="s2">can do now is take</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.520" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">reasonable sensible steps to decrease</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">the danger</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">the risk to the social nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">to make it less likely</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.560" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">that we&#39;ll blunder into a nuclear war</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re promoting now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">not giving up and do not give up the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">idea of eventually being able to abolish</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:30.239" style="s2">nuclear weapons but i&#39;m putting my</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.560" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">efforts now on the thing where i have</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.239" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">a chance for political success that can</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:36.319" style="s2">actually be implemented another these</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:38.640" style="s2">particular proposals</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.319" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">to take actions to reduce the danger of</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">tom what do you want to add to that well</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">i i would i would just add that there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a hopeful uh development</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">happening internationally</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:51.839" style="s2">which is that there is a new treaty that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">was approved a few years ago by the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.839" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">united nations</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">which would prohibit nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">and make them illegal under</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">international law</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">and this is the same approach that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">world has taken to uh chemical weapons</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">uh which are prohibited internationally</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">and biological weapons and those are the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">other weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:14.840" style="s2">and if we take the same approach to</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">nuclear weapons uh prohibit them</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.840" end="01:10:17.920" style="s2">internationally</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">and my guess is that treaty will go into</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">force probably sometime next year</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:25.679" style="s2">then that increases the international</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:27.440" style="s2">pressure on the states that have nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.679" end="01:10:30.159" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.440" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">to get rid of them now this will not be</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.159" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">a quick</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">process none of the states that have</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">uh have signed on to the nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:42.640" style="s2">prohibition treaty but</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a start and again it&#39;s it&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.640" end="01:10:46.560" style="s2">other weapons</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:47.360" style="s2">of mass destruction were ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.560" end="01:10:49.199" style="s2">banned</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.360" end="01:10:51.040" style="s2">um and i think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a promising</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.199" end="01:10:53.120" style="s2">direction i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.040" end="01:10:54.239" style="s2">jim i entirely agree with what tom has</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.120" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">just said</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.239" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">but i would point out it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">long process</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a long five years ten years</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:03.520" style="s2">a long process</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">in the meantime we should do everything</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.520" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:08.560" style="s2">to lower the risk of blundering into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">nuclear war</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.560" end="01:11:13.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what this book is about well</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">thank you gentlemen for an incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.600" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">interesting and stimulating conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">you know to recap for the listeners the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">proposal to correct me if i&#39;m wrong are</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">basically to do the following</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:27.280" style="s2">one is to eliminate first use by the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">united states presumably by legislation</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:31.520" style="s2">two is to go to a five-key system</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">approximately where it would take five</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.520" end="01:11:35.120" style="s2">key decision makers</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">to be able to launch a weapon it would</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.120" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">have to be cryptologically secure so</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">that indeed all five would actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">have to do so eliminate the icbms</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">because they&#39;re asymmetry about risk</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">versus power makes them attractors for</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:50.800" style="s2">drawing</p>

<p begin="01:11:53.920" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">and perhaps put our strategic bombers at</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.239" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">least in part back</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">on air alert is that the proposal</p>

<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">and the proposal on the air alert is</p>

<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">in the contingent that that needs and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">only after the icbms are gone</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">okay let&#39;s make that clear alrighty any</p>
