<p begin="00:00:10.980" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.960" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">like it looks some rustic yes old stone</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">house kind of in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:22.949" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually I&#39;ve just my car broke</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">down a week couple of weeks ago and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.949" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">gonna try living here without a car and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:28.670" style="s2">rely on the kindness of neighbors and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">that kind of thing but I need to move</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.670" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">and see I mean it seems I use it like</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">once a week it seems ridiculous to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">all that rubber and glass and metal and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">whatever you know it I mean just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">there most of the time when I hardly use</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:41.700" style="s2">it so I&#39;m gonna try I&#39;m gonna try if</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">it&#39;s intolerable then I&#39;ll get another</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.700" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">car but I&#39;m gonna see how it goes nice</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">yeah I mean obviously my my guess not</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">obviously to my my mind leaps as you say</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">all that rubber and glass and steel and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">aluminium and gasoline just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">sitting there slowly oxidizing my mind</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">a driver show up with a coach or a wagon</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">possible to maybe have a local farmer</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">who has one and that individual could</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">bring and you can borrow that when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">needed it and then of course the pop</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">imagine that where you are is what makes</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">need to have access to a vehicle to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">into town and that&#39;s all I need</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">yep that&#39;s right and I mean you should</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:13.630" style="s2">get I did a little bit of research on</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:15.160" style="s2">this a while ago actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.630" end="00:02:17.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten I know some numbers there</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:20.350" style="s2">are 32 million vehicles registered in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.110" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">the UK and at any given moment in time</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.350" end="00:02:26.530" style="s2">between 80 and 99.9% of them are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:27.940" style="s2">being used you know and so not only is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.530" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">all of that waste of resources but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.940" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">they&#39;re sitting there parked on the side</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:33.370" style="s2">of the road blocking you know blocking</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:34.900" style="s2">potential access for traffic so you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.370" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">all those cars off the road double the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.900" end="00:02:39.820" style="s2">road with effectively immediately right</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">you know it&#39;s yeah the access versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.820" end="00:02:42.430" style="s2">ownership thing but you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:43.480" style="s2">this is actually one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.430" end="00:02:45.160" style="s2">want to talk to you about today is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.480" end="00:02:47.170" style="s2">is the my head you get a head you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.160" end="00:02:49.510" style="s2">over these mindset which is so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.170" end="00:02:51.640" style="s2">ingrained hah my right you know owning a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.510" end="00:02:53.830" style="s2">car so yeah I&#39;d like to get onto that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.640" end="00:02:55.300" style="s2">little bit later but yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.830" end="00:02:57.400" style="s2">really very much for making the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.300" end="00:02:59.890" style="s2">against talk to me I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.400" end="00:03:01.420" style="s2">it and since I last spoke to you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.890" end="00:03:03.460" style="s2">actually discovered that game B is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.420" end="00:03:04.780" style="s2">just I thought it was like a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.460" end="00:03:07.720" style="s2">framework that you would create it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.780" end="00:03:09.070" style="s2">order to you know explain the precipice</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.720" end="00:03:11.620" style="s2">that we were approaching in there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.070" end="00:03:13.240" style="s2">the profound type of change that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.620" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">necessary in the way we go about things</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.240" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">in you know in order to in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:18.340" style="s2">avert that but actually it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">than that right it&#39;s it&#39;s actually sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.340" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">of a movement and a project and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:26.440" style="s2">wonder if you could just briefly outline</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.910" style="s2">the history of it how it came about you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.440" end="00:03:28.360" style="s2">know what was the impetus for getting it</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.910" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.360" end="00:03:36.700" style="s2">Wow okay great so let&#39;s see well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:38.320" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to do first is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.700" end="00:03:41.140" style="s2">and this is a bit of a quibble but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.320" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">like it I think it&#39;s a useful quibble to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:46.990" style="s2">make a distinction between the concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.670" style="s2">known as movement and the concept that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.990" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">we&#39;re going to introduce I&#39;ve introduced</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.670" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2">elsewhere and you may already be</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:55.960" style="s2">familiar with it obscene yes yes I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.420" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">seen videos aeneas yeah so - so baby as</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.960" end="00:04:00.330" style="s2">a senior&#39;s not a movement and I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:03.520" style="s2">say that in fact run by proposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.330" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">every movement is in fact what happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.520" end="00:04:09.790" style="s2">when you intent to formalize and market</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">a scene yes the moment where a scene is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.790" end="00:04:14.710" style="s2">becomes captured into something that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:17.260" style="s2">not it but is a simulation of it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.710" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">can be sold at a profit that is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.260" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:23.220" style="s2">I think this explains a lot about how</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">and why the things that have been in his</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">movements in the past have done what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">they&#39;ve done but I&#39;ve also failed to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:34.200" style="s2">almost universally what they most fully</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:35.970" style="s2">intended yeah so consciously right</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.200" end="00:04:37.530" style="s2">consciously it would be a sad thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.970" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">if gaming workers become a movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.530" end="00:04:40.410" style="s2">which of course it could it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">captured in a moment but it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.410" end="00:04:44.010" style="s2">endeavoring to be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">possibility of that and to maintain its</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.010" end="00:04:47.190" style="s2">integrity as its seen yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">so I already begins to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.190" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">question so this is very much an</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">exercise of discovery there was a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">or less the way this began let me see if</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.440" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.500" end="00:05:05.949" style="s2">a couple of threats</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.529" end="00:05:08.989" style="s2">interesting so maybe I&#39;ll just identify</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.949" end="00:05:10.459" style="s2">three I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many many many</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.989" end="00:05:12.829" style="s2">many but I&#39;ll do three this seemed</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.459" end="00:05:17.689" style="s2">useful one</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.829" end="00:05:19.879" style="s2">Mia&#39;s around 2007 I was introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.689" end="00:05:22.939" style="s2">her about a book called demon by Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.879" end="00:05:26.019" style="s2">Suarez which is a sort of science</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.399" end="00:05:46.789" style="s2">thinking because Daniel Suarez the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.559" end="00:05:48.229" style="s2">author did a hell of a good job</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.789" end="00:05:49.879" style="s2">predicting the future including things</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.569" end="00:06:08.739" style="s2">framing of the game was quite helpful</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">and you might there&#39;s a gentleman named</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.389" end="00:06:25.380" style="s2">together by the book Damon and even some</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:26.850" style="s2">of the early writings in deep code are</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.380" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">actually just cut and paste of some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.850" end="00:06:34.740" style="s2">the stuff that we did so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:37.410" style="s2">thread the second thread was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.740" end="00:06:41.130" style="s2">work that I had begun doing on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.410" end="00:06:43.669" style="s2">nature of money in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.130" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">financial crisis and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.669" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">practically curious and I was in a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.320" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve mentioned this before and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:54.630" style="s2">think it David one of the ripa wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.320" end="00:06:55.979" style="s2">interviews I was in a place but most</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.630" end="00:06:57.750" style="s2">notably in this case but the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.979" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">Institute and the Aspen Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.750" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">other places like the Perimeter</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:05.760" style="s2">Institute to just have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:07.889" style="s2">with people who knew a lot more and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.760" end="00:07:09.270" style="s2">should have known a lot lot more and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.889" end="00:07:11.669" style="s2">I got this really interesting capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.270" end="00:07:13.740" style="s2">to have pretty quickly get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.669" end="00:07:15.450" style="s2">what was the real state-of-the-art in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.740" end="00:07:17.720" style="s2">thinking about this particular most</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.450" end="00:07:22.280" style="s2">meaningful and at the time quite salient</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.720" end="00:07:25.260" style="s2">question that it was shockingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.280" end="00:07:27.570" style="s2">incoherent hmm and then started looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.260" end="00:07:29.099" style="s2">at it myself mostly reading three books</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.570" end="00:07:30.750" style="s2">so he was called the origin of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.099" end="00:07:34.950" style="s2">which is a complex complexity approach</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.750" end="00:07:38.190" style="s2">to economics a book by a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.950" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">conservative British guy something about</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:41.310" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:44.909" style="s2">Ian something maybe and then graters</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.310" end="00:07:48.509" style="s2">book about thousand years of not of debt</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.909" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">which is awesome and this begin the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.509" end="00:07:50.849" style="s2">process of leading me down the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:54.360" style="s2">hole and I should say by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.849" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">just even background on that an early</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.360" end="00:08:00.990" style="s2">dose of a who I think it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:04.529" style="s2">highest bang for the buck like most</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:09.270" style="s2">obscure and most useful philosopher like</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.529" end="00:08:11.159" style="s2">I named Manuel de langue de like I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.270" end="00:08:13.770" style="s2">I would guess that that&#39;s the name that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.159" end="00:08:15.659" style="s2">is the most likely that nobody&#39;s heard</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.770" end="00:08:16.979" style="s2">of him when I say it and would be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.659" end="00:08:20.969" style="s2">most valuable for literally everybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.979" end="00:08:24.389" style="s2">who have to read it with those two</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.969" end="00:08:26.309" style="s2">curves right so del andhe and the two</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.389" end="00:08:27.689" style="s2">books that are most specific here is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.309" end="00:08:29.849" style="s2">war in the age of intelligent machines</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.689" end="00:08:32.250" style="s2">it was his first book and I think like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.849" end="00:08:34.199" style="s2">95 and the second one is a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.250" end="00:08:36.599" style="s2">years of nonlinear history and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.199" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">guy who innovated or at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.599" end="00:08:39.389" style="s2">meaningfully innovate something called</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2">assemblage today or that he calls</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.389" end="00:08:44.009" style="s2">assemblage theory and anyone who is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">thinking about complexity like complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.009" end="00:08:50.130" style="s2">systems science who hasn&#39;t fully</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.130" end="00:08:53.069" style="s2">planks in their mind so I had done that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.810" end="00:08:57.779" style="s2">like I&#39;d already done all that work</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.069" end="00:08:59.490" style="s2">through 1999 to 2007 so that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.779" end="00:09:01.500" style="s2">in the background so that I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.490" end="00:09:04.199" style="s2">this experience with Suarez I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:07.380" style="s2">this experience with Graber and then my</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.199" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">my friend Jim rut who was at the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.380" end="00:09:12.300" style="s2">the chairman of the board of the Santa</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">Fe Institute and I just start having a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.300" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">dialogue literally just like a coffee</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:18.589" style="s2">breaks between board meetings where it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:20.069" style="s2">becomes clear that we both had a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.589" end="00:09:22.350" style="s2">significant sense of there being</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.069" end="00:09:25.139" style="s2">something rotten in the state of Denmark</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.350" end="00:09:26.339" style="s2">something corrupt in the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.139" end="00:09:31.139" style="s2">society that we have a to find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.339" end="00:09:34.339" style="s2">in and and Jim is a very action-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.139" end="00:09:37.470" style="s2">individual but he has sort of the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.339" end="00:09:39.180" style="s2">sort of doing energy remember the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.470" end="00:09:42.449" style="s2">most of anybody who I have ever met and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.180" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s senior to me he&#39;s I think if</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.449" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">I&#39;m 48 he&#39;s probably Gashi maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:51.810" style="s2">pushing 70 started if I&#39;m if I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:54.510" style="s2">aging you I apologize but he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.810" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2">in that zone and he did like his wave of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.510" end="00:09:57.329" style="s2">entrepreneurship he&#39;s a high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:09:58.170" style="s2">entrepreneur very successful high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.329" end="00:09:59.520" style="s2">entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.170" end="00:10:02.610" style="s2">so his wave of entrepreneurship was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.520" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">exactly one shift before Matt like when</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.610" end="00:10:06.690" style="s2">I was a kid working on BBS as he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:08.460" style="s2">just in early entrepreneur creating BBS</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.690" end="00:10:11.220" style="s2">software for example and then he created</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.460" end="00:10:14.310" style="s2">or was was the CEO of the company that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.220" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">did DNS which was didn&#39;t the platform</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.310" end="00:10:21.030" style="s2">the internet upon which I did my work so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">as a consequence of our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.030" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">one of the things that showed up is he</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">was the guy who presented this concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:29.460" style="s2">which we later named the Jubilee which</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:32.840" style="s2">by the way Cohen said it&#39;s sort of nice</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.460" end="00:10:35.130" style="s2">than with grey bears on propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.840" end="00:10:36.510" style="s2">began to conceptualize well what might</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:37.770" style="s2">we actually do so if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.510" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">rotten the state of Denmark what do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.770" end="00:10:42.570" style="s2">do about it and gender is elitist</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:43.950" style="s2">so he took the lead in his mental model</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.570" end="00:10:46.440" style="s2">was actually just through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.950" end="00:10:49.620" style="s2">politics like how could we actually do a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.440" end="00:10:51.840" style="s2">political intervention with very high</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.620" end="00:10:53.700" style="s2">leverage meaning not just policies that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.840" end="00:10:55.080" style="s2">are sort of fun and nice but actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.700" end="00:10:57.090" style="s2">policies that are very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.080" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">designed from a complexity perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.090" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">to generate trophic cascades in the con</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.980" style="s2">and the complex systems feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:08.820" style="s2">of society so that it we actually did</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.980" end="00:11:10.470" style="s2">move things meaningfully and if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.820" end="00:11:12.390" style="s2">think about that as they abstract intent</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.470" end="00:11:14.690" style="s2">things begin to actually make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.390" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">so the the artifact or the way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.690" end="00:11:19.380" style="s2">embodying that intent initially was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">political party initially I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.380" end="00:11:23.400" style="s2">calling the new day party that he got</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.110" style="s2">rebranded as the emancipation party I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.400" end="00:11:29.460" style="s2">think you can still find the website if</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.110" end="00:11:30.840" style="s2">you google it and we spent meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.460" end="00:11:33.840" style="s2">amount of time with a pretty good group</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.840" end="00:11:37.020" style="s2">of people thinking in the in the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.840" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">mall or the frame of policies and trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.020" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">to create policies that were very</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:43.530" style="s2">thoughtful and for example we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:47.190" style="s2">proposing universal basic income way</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.530" end="00:11:52.770" style="s2">back then this is probably 2011 2012</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.190" end="00:11:53.310" style="s2">2010 somewhere in that timeframe and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.770" end="00:11:55.470" style="s2">proceeded for</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">and there was you know some momentum but</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.470" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">as we continue to maneuver we noticed</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:07.880" style="s2">two different things one was that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">forum the forum of political party and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.880" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">in fact the form of politics in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">domain of democracy seemed very much not</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:19.280" style="s2">to be the right structure a way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:21.500" style="s2">putting it is Millennials don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.280" end="00:12:23.320" style="s2">politics and so if you&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.500" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">something that is going to be ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.320" end="00:12:27.950" style="s2">landing on Millennials and the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">younger than them and if they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.950" end="00:12:32.540" style="s2">politics this is back in 2010 2011 then</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.100" end="00:12:34.400" style="s2">politics the political structure is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.540" end="00:12:37.010" style="s2">the right approach certainly a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.400" end="00:12:38.930" style="s2">political party it&#39;s not even just about</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.010" end="00:12:41.570" style="s2">that though is it I mean the the very</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.930" end="00:12:44.780" style="s2">council&#39;s of party is exclusionary right</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.570" end="00:12:46.370" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s only in the realm of rival</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.780" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">ristmas and this is one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.370" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">things to get away from right right</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.870" end="00:12:50.900" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:54.970" style="s2">so in fact so this is the second piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.900" end="00:12:59.390" style="s2">the second piece was as people began to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.970" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">participate who were but people like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.390" end="00:13:05.300" style="s2">Brett Brett Weinstein and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:08.780" style="s2">determinant Sebastian Coquet a number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.300" end="00:13:11.450" style="s2">folks who were oriented towards a more</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.780" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">theoretical perspective and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.450" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">theoretical basis you know as I said we</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:16.130" style="s2">were trying to do things that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:17.660" style="s2">fundamental and so we were constantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.130" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">trying to figure out what would it mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.660" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">to do something this one minute which</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:22.940" style="s2">means they were actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">fundamental theory and this is where Jim</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.940" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">had actually specifically assigned me</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:28.460" style="s2">the responsibilities of what he called</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:30.290" style="s2">deep code you keep doing the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.460" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">theory until we have something we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.290" end="00:13:34.250" style="s2">actually use to build things on top of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:36.520" style="s2">it those before you almost all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.250" end="00:13:39.550" style="s2">that I&#39;ve shared online was either</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.520" end="00:13:42.620" style="s2">figured out by me or discovered by me or</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.550" end="00:13:46.640" style="s2">shared with me by various people during</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.620" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">this time for more or less mostly but</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.640" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">they&#39;re mostly shared</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.730" end="00:13:54.839" style="s2">and so the theoretical foundation began</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.399" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">to actually point out a lot of stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.839" end="00:13:59.730" style="s2">were talking about like the concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:01.380" style="s2">rivalries and anti drivers simply hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.730" end="00:14:03.480" style="s2">been part of the mindset until around oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.380" end="00:14:05.220" style="s2"> this is more fundamental Campos</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.480" end="00:14:06.750" style="s2">like complex and complicated weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.220" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">part of the mindset so as the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.750" end="00:14:12.360" style="s2">theoretical foundation began to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">require a design it became increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.360" end="00:14:16.920" style="s2">evident the design of a political party</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">was just the wrong tool and there was an</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.920" end="00:14:20.459" style="s2">an intermezzo where there was a okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.600" end="00:14:22.649" style="s2">well maybe it&#39;s the wrong tool but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.459" end="00:14:25.139" style="s2">it&#39;s a transition or a useful tool like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.649" end="00:14:25.529" style="s2">we can use it to create space to do the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.139" end="00:14:27.480" style="s2">next thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.529" end="00:14:30.120" style="s2">but then practically would it look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.480" end="00:14:31.620" style="s2">well gee is more or less they won&#39;t land</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.120" end="00:14:33.630" style="s2">like the idea of a new political party</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.620" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">just literally is not a real idea nobody</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.630" end="00:14:38.579" style="s2">will participate in it then even that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">argument went away and this thing gave</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.579" end="00:14:42.209" style="s2">birth to the concept of game be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:46.139" style="s2">say okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.209" end="00:14:47.370" style="s2">Paul I was Greenhill at the time if</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.139" end="00:14:49.290" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be doing a political</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.370" end="00:14:52.139" style="s2">party what is something that might work</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.290" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">so just start thank you figuring that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.139" end="00:14:58.139" style="s2">out just think about it and and we had</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.149" style="s2">these gatherings in Virginia so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.139" end="00:15:01.620" style="s2">like a city in Virginia called Staunton</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.149" end="00:15:06.329" style="s2">Virginia so extended one two three four</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.620" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">five and so it&#39;s ten four when she had</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.329" end="00:15:10.980" style="s2">two really important presentations one</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:13.410" style="s2">by Brett and one by myself and Jim made</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.980" end="00:15:16.319" style="s2">the third but the first two by Brett and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.410" end="00:15:20.370" style="s2">myself were really the the kernel of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.319" end="00:15:21.870" style="s2">game B you can imagine Brett coming from</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.370" end="00:15:24.269" style="s2">his background he was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.870" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">describing how could we design something</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.269" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">that would not that would it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:31.500" style="s2">evolve to towards the solution towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:33.180" style="s2">the thing that we&#39;re looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.500" end="00:15:35.940" style="s2">then I came at it from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.180" end="00:15:38.279" style="s2">of what is the meta design of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.940" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">of thing and how does it relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.279" end="00:15:41.760" style="s2">circumstances we find ourselves in and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:43.829" style="s2">think that should both those</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.760" end="00:15:45.779" style="s2">presentations are still you know exists</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.829" end="00:15:46.949" style="s2">somewhere in the digital memory there</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.779" end="00:15:50.819" style="s2">may even be a video of me given the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.949" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">presentation and that was at Stanton for</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.819" end="00:15:59.699" style="s2">I want to say maybe 2012 and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:16:01.380" style="s2">Stanton 5 was a substantial expansion so</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.699" end="00:16:03.449" style="s2">it between Snoopy had a huge little</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.380" end="00:16:04.620" style="s2">conversation and a lot more people were</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.449" end="00:16:08.970" style="s2">beginning to be part of this prod</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.620" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">maybe 100 ish and that is maybe 70 in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.970" end="00:16:15.030" style="s2">base camp remember that was before slack</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:16.080" style="s2">and a lot of conversation covering a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.030" end="00:16:19.860" style="s2">of territory and trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.080" end="00:16:21.990" style="s2">how to do this work and that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.860" end="00:16:24.150" style="s2">end of the naming of it is well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.990" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">I named it game B earlier but beginning</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.150" end="00:16:29.220" style="s2">the the real precision and articulation</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:31.500" style="s2">and standing v was a a real gathering</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.220" end="00:16:35.460" style="s2">that included folks like Bruce Kunkel by</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.500" end="00:16:39.540" style="s2">the way who I see a lot on the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:42.330" style="s2">and we need a Roy who&#39;s that it was at</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.540" end="00:16:44.640" style="s2">that gathering really Kerr trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.330" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">deep and got a matsuhiko camera was</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.640" end="00:16:51.870" style="s2">there gosh I hope I&#39;m not creating a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:53.400" style="s2">list of folks to kill and if so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.870" end="00:17:00.390" style="s2">everything I just said is a very big lie</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.400" end="00:17:04.020" style="s2">and none of those people were there just</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.390" end="00:17:05.820" style="s2">a little bit may you characterized as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.020" end="00:17:07.410" style="s2">result of all of your research just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.820" end="00:17:09.180" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong the basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.410" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">characteristics of game a and hence game</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.180" end="00:17:16.760" style="s2">B is the opposite of that is complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.760" style="s2">rather than complex rival ruse and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.940" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">top-down broadcast in natures is that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:24.780" style="s2">that basically the core of it is is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:26.580" style="s2">the essence of it well let me just fire</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.780" end="00:17:28.110" style="s2">up a bunch of other words and we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.580" end="00:17:30.060" style="s2">if they reduce to those three I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.110" end="00:17:34.490" style="s2">think my basic answer is yes let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.060" end="00:17:36.779" style="s2">some other ones so formal</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.490" end="00:17:38.399" style="s2">but that could be identified as</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.779" end="00:17:41.909" style="s2">complicated I think that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.399" end="00:17:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a better yes hierarchical again</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.700" end="00:18:04.610" style="s2">not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to try</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.350" end="00:19:45.879" style="s2">the in the air in the sky for the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.570" end="00:19:48.909" style="s2">part right but of course the location on</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.879" end="00:19:51.580" style="s2">that continuum is a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.909" end="00:19:53.139" style="s2">the presence of the phenomenon and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.580" end="00:19:54.850" style="s2">demand of the phenomena all right so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.139" end="00:19:56.889" style="s2">you add enough people into the equation</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.850" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">who are breathing air eventually all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.889" end="00:20:00.009" style="s2">air in the sky is no longer in Punta</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">dude is now in scarcity where as you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.009" end="00:20:04.659" style="s2">kind of snap back and forth and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:06.629" style="s2">other continuum and by the way like</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.659" end="00:20:09.159" style="s2">might put non-rival risk is kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.629" end="00:20:10.809" style="s2">net terms and then on the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.159" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">continuum we have the anti robberies</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.809" end="00:20:17.860" style="s2">continuum and so this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:19.889" style="s2">calculus or geometry or literally</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.860" end="00:20:23.470" style="s2">anything that lives in pure pattern</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.889" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">we&#39;re on the far you know the far far</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.470" end="00:20:31.300" style="s2">right hand side we have the fully</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:36.490" style="s2">unmediated potentia that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.300" end="00:20:39.700" style="s2">utterly unconsumed in its being help you</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:40.630" style="s2">when I tell you something right now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:43.000" style="s2">I just tell you what I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.630" end="00:20:44.560" style="s2">you&#39;re actually providing the resource</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.000" end="00:20:47.850" style="s2">the scarce resource which is your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.560" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">neurology and then the pattern is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.850" end="00:20:54.610" style="s2">scarce at all so tabbed all over to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.540" style="s2">right and we can tag even all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.610" end="00:20:57.160" style="s2">the right of those are those</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.540" end="00:21:00.040" style="s2">characteristics of anti drivers that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.160" end="00:21:03.340" style="s2">generative meaning that when shared</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.040" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">their potency for producing more</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.340" end="00:21:09.310" style="s2">antirattle ristmas is actually increased</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:10.930" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got this whole if you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.310" end="00:21:11.890" style="s2">about the logic of network effects you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.930" end="00:21:15.550" style="s2">can actually think about those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.890" end="00:21:17.260" style="s2">that there are sort of all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.550" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">the right of that we can go down some</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.260" end="00:21:20.710" style="s2">real interesting powerful detail because</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:23.560" style="s2">that&#39;s science the science of the entity</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.710" end="00:21:25.540" style="s2">rivalries is kind of like mine well done</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.560" end="00:21:26.830" style="s2">Honda it&#39;s sort of obvious that the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.540" end="00:21:29.590" style="s2">important thing that you could really be</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">thinking about if you care about being</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.590" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">effective and is the area that is very</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:35.980" style="s2">rarely thought about so we can go there</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:37.150" style="s2">if you&#39;d like but on the left hand side</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.980" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">of the anti driverís</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">is those things that our media are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:46.930" style="s2">mediation the things that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:49.620" style="s2">use the minimum viable mediation to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.930" end="00:21:52.390" style="s2">able to have an amount of anti robberies</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.620" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">so for example your mind your brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.390" end="00:21:57.250" style="s2">there&#39;s only so much anti reverse</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:22:01.540" style="s2">pattern that your neurology can actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:22:03.820" style="s2">hold and so there is a real rivalry that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.540" end="00:22:06.430" style="s2">is in relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:07.450" style="s2">fundamentally anti rivalries and you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.430" end="00:22:10.210" style="s2">move back and forth on that continuum</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.450" end="00:22:12.520" style="s2">and then by the way just to be complete</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.210" end="00:22:14.590" style="s2">when you think that whole can go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.520" end="00:22:16.330" style="s2">continuum and those are both talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.590" end="00:22:17.860" style="s2">about the anti robbers and rivalries and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.330" end="00:22:21.570" style="s2">the point of view of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.860" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">phenomenology like phenomena in world</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.570" end="00:22:28.210" style="s2">objective real things we can also talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:31.240" style="s2">about those in terms of dispositions or</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.210" end="00:22:33.220" style="s2">our ways of behaving in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.240" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">real things so I can have a rival wrist</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.220" end="00:22:36.760" style="s2">disposition or I can have an anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:39.700" style="s2">roberts disposition or we have a non</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.760" end="00:22:41.620" style="s2">rivals disposition and again there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.700" end="00:22:43.240" style="s2">continua and these things relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:44.950" style="s2">other so there&#39;s like this structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:45.250" style="s2">which may be a nine a three by three I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.950" end="00:22:48.940" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.250" end="00:22:50.530" style="s2">you know they talked about how the kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.940" end="00:22:52.050" style="s2">of the complex dynamics of where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.530" end="00:22:54.370" style="s2">find yourself and how you show up</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.050" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">creates so the ways that things these</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.370" end="00:22:59.320" style="s2">things only do is are back before a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:03.850" style="s2">rival risk disposition in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.320" end="00:23:08.050" style="s2">a non rival rest a plenitude will put</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.850" end="00:23:10.090" style="s2">you in a tragedy of the Commons which</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.050" end="00:23:14.560" style="s2">will eventually lead to actual scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.090" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">for example a rival wrist disposition in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.560" end="00:23:19.810" style="s2">the context of the anti robberies will</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.110" end="00:23:22.150" style="s2">lead to trying to fence in the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.810" end="00:23:23.890" style="s2">create for example intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.150" end="00:23:25.570" style="s2">which will move something from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.890" end="00:23:28.630" style="s2">fundamental unity rather listen to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.570" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">simulated scarcity for example so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.630" end="00:23:35.830" style="s2">can do that kind of work okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:38.680" style="s2">the end of that the grand vision of The</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.830" end="00:23:41.350" style="s2">Venus Project wasn&#39;t it that you created</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.680" end="00:23:43.930" style="s2">the ultimate anti rivalries domain</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.350" end="00:23:46.330" style="s2">globally because everybody contributes</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.930" end="00:23:48.100" style="s2">not for what they can get but to add to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.330" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">the Commons and everybody has access to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.100" end="00:23:52.030" style="s2">the Commons and as the Commons gets</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:53.380" style="s2">richer everybody benefits from it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">can contribute more because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.380" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">living in a healthier environment and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:23:59.620" style="s2">on and so on so on and as far as like</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:03.010" style="s2">this oh no for sure I mean I actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.620" end="00:24:04.990" style="s2">came to rebel wisdom and game being all</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.010" end="00:24:07.900" style="s2">of this via the zeitgeist movement of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.990" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">The Venus Project and Jacque fresco</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.900" end="00:24:12.100" style="s2">talks in very very similar terms I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:14.590" style="s2">actually hear you guys and him using</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.100" end="00:24:16.540" style="s2">much of the same language but for him it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.590" end="00:24:17.920" style="s2">was the monetary system which created</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.540" end="00:24:20.110" style="s2">the rivalries but I think the rivals</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.920" end="00:24:21.640" style="s2">it&#39;s deeper than they stick right under</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.110" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">pins money doesn&#39;t it the rival the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.640" end="00:24:26.440" style="s2">rival was dynamic while I was not</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:27.130" style="s2">directly influenced by Jacque Fresco&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:29.950" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:33.550" style="s2">I was bizarrely enough influenced by his</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.950" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">aesthetics meaning that I had at a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.550" end="00:24:37.690" style="s2">young age come across images that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:39.880" style="s2">been produced by him and they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.690" end="00:24:43.150" style="s2">connected with me in a way that was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.880" end="00:24:45.000" style="s2">compelling and so even what many years</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.150" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">later I found myself doing a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.000" end="00:24:49.990" style="s2">weird search through what was what could</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:51.460" style="s2">have generated these these images in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.990" end="00:24:53.220" style="s2">mind like hey I kept having these images</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.460" end="00:24:56.050" style="s2">pop up but aesthetically matched the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.220" end="00:24:57.910" style="s2">sensibility of game B what are these</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.050" end="00:24:58.610" style="s2">things I was like okay looks at 70s I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.910" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">had a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.610" end="00:25:02.809" style="s2">when it was encountered it like 70</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.220" style="s2">science fiction top what was this and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.809" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">turned out it was actually not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.220" end="00:25:10.370" style="s2">but a decent amount of it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:12.350" style="s2">his stuff from a physical way it looked</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.370" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">yeah I was never able to really get</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.350" end="00:25:15.230" style="s2">enough of a handle on where it is he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.880" end="00:25:18.350" style="s2">proposing in terms of resource of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.230" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">economy so it feel I kind of got it but</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.350" end="00:25:23.210" style="s2">at the aesthetic level it totally landed</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:26.809" style="s2">so so then what happens we had this sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.210" end="00:25:27.910" style="s2">of a burst of energy in game be building</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.809" end="00:25:29.750" style="s2">had a whole bunch of different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.910" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">most of which were very poorly</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.750" end="00:25:34.970" style="s2">articulated probably named and roughly</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:36.020" style="s2">hewn but seems like like we&#39;d go back</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.970" end="00:25:37.790" style="s2">and take a look at it&#39;s like yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.020" end="00:25:40.010" style="s2">were giddy got had some very good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.790" end="00:25:42.500" style="s2">done then and we decided at this point</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.010" end="00:25:44.600" style="s2">that Jim and I could no longer or did</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.500" end="00:25:46.460" style="s2">not know looker chose to fund it out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">our own pocket and it was time to go out</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.460" end="00:25:50.690" style="s2">and see if other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna buy into this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.690" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">think part of this was also Jim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:57.500" style="s2">instincts that how do you avoid becoming</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:59.179" style="s2">a navel-gazing how do you avoid drinking</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">this is where we discovered the in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:16.820" style="s2">the answer was no we did I&#39;d say like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:19.340" style="s2">hundred different conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.820" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">people many of whom really should have</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.340" end="00:26:26.059" style="s2">been able to get it and and sort of long</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.700" end="00:26:27.590" style="s2">story short nobody did and I can go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.059" end="00:26:29.570" style="s2">detail exactly what we learned from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.590" end="00:26:31.190" style="s2">would happen in that context and in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.570" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">meantime because you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.190" end="00:26:35.980" style="s2">articulating it as clearly as you do now</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:38.230" style="s2">having having thought it through better</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.980" end="00:26:40.770" style="s2">I would say I would say three things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.230" end="00:26:43.320" style="s2">roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.770" end="00:26:44.909" style="s2">maybe for one is we were not</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.320" end="00:26:51.630" style="s2">articulating it anywhere near as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.909" end="00:26:53.399" style="s2">as we are now maybe 10% which if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.630" end="00:26:58.500" style="s2">think about how unclear it is right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.399" end="00:27:00.840" style="s2">that&#39;s rather impressive to was almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.500" end="00:27:04.710" style="s2">nobody was prepared to hear it and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.549" end="00:27:17.090" style="s2">consciousness and into the minds that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.799" end="00:27:21.380" style="s2">makes it much easier to bridge the gap</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.090" end="00:27:24.440" style="s2">three the proposition that game a was</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.380" end="00:27:27.450" style="s2">fragile getting more fragile and was</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.450" end="00:27:32.370" style="s2">viscerally realistic seven years ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.880" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">okay the 2008 financial crisis if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.370" end="00:27:34.110" style="s2">kind of solved that we&#39;re all world with</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.179" end="00:27:43.950" style="s2">Google guys saying that and of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.020" end="00:27:45.720" style="s2">most of the people who were speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.950" end="00:27:48.299" style="s2">with had some vested interest in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.720" end="00:27:49.320" style="s2">not being the case you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.299" end="00:27:50.850" style="s2">talking to people who at least in</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.320" end="00:27:53.820" style="s2">principle could fund something so they</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.850" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">had one game a to some level or if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.820" end="00:27:58.919" style="s2">couldn&#39;t find it they were at least able</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:28:01.919" style="s2">to be they had legitimacy they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.919" end="00:28:05.220" style="s2">winners in gaming in some fashion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.919" end="00:28:08.190" style="s2">then the fourth was something along the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.220" end="00:28:10.649" style="s2">lines of and kind of because of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.190" end="00:28:13.559" style="s2">third people hadn&#39;t gone to the grieving</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.649" end="00:28:15.990" style="s2">process and so what would happen is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.559" end="00:28:17.549" style="s2">often we actually just see that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.990" end="00:28:19.799" style="s2">could get it they&#39;d sense it they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.549" end="00:28:22.470" style="s2">realize it but then it immediately shut</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.799" end="00:28:24.360" style="s2">down and not absorb it because you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.470" end="00:28:26.549" style="s2">it&#39;s a tough thing to to chew on you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.360" end="00:28:27.270" style="s2">scare yeah it&#39;s big and scary and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.549" end="00:28:29.789" style="s2">that was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.270" end="00:28:31.590" style="s2">and so in and by the way so on the one</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.789" end="00:28:33.390" style="s2">hand the outward facing Keene</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.590" end="00:28:35.580" style="s2">this isn&#39;t landing and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.390" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">the inward facing is I think Jim talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.580" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">about in a podcast there was a schism on</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">the inside the group between those</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">people who were coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:50.860" style="s2">perspective of work on the interior and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:54.710" style="s2">people remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.860" end="00:28:57.590" style="s2">to work on the exterior so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.710" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">a generation gap here too my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.590" end="00:29:02.419" style="s2">that the boomers have a bad have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">mapping they were kind of burned by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.419" end="00:29:07.789" style="s2">failure of the consciousness experiment</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:09.740" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s and they have look</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.789" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">like little petulant toddlers it just</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.740" end="00:29:13.970" style="s2">because they it up means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:15.799" style="s2">impossible and I would say like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.970" end="00:29:16.820" style="s2">saying that kind of mean okay and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:18.350" style="s2">could definitely say they it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.820" end="00:29:20.360" style="s2">but on the other hand just cuz it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:21.649" style="s2">work then means it&#39;s impossible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.360" end="00:29:24.049" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s reasonable to say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.649" end="00:29:26.260" style="s2">lots of good stuff happened then onto</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.049" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">beds to that but lots of good stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.260" end="00:29:33.559" style="s2">these sort of things are hard so we had</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:36.890" style="s2">a kind of a visceral response and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.559" end="00:29:38.990" style="s2">part of exterior oriented boomers who</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.890" end="00:29:41.539" style="s2">are like not at all interested in any</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.990" end="00:29:43.070" style="s2">kind of consciousness raising talk even</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.539" end="00:29:45.590" style="s2">language to talk about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.070" end="00:29:46.669" style="s2">people have an interior at all and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.590" end="00:29:48.649" style="s2">a cohort of people who are just coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.669" end="00:29:50.840" style="s2">from that land and so they&#39;re more and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.649" end="00:29:52.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a bias in that direction to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.840" end="00:29:54.529" style="s2">bias towards hey let&#39;s not worry about</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.730" end="00:29:56.210" style="s2">institutions we just need to give his</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.529" end="00:29:59.690" style="s2">consciousness raised which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.210" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">also not reasonable and so that schism</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.690" end="00:30:03.260" style="s2">was happening and I noticed it been</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.490" style="s2">created a D cohered the system pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.260" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">quickly actually and it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.490" end="00:30:08.419" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting too that while we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.549" style="s2">a brief moment like a little summer of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.419" end="00:30:12.350" style="s2">love for like a night a year like six</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.549" end="00:30:13.580" style="s2">months where there&#39;s a while a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.350" end="00:30:15.230" style="s2">creative activity a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.580" end="00:30:20.360" style="s2">pouring energy in its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.230" end="00:30:23.720" style="s2">decohere around somewhat who cares like</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.360" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re relevant or bad distinctions was</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.720" end="00:30:29.000" style="s2">also quite notable and so Jim and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.620" style="s2">agreed and by the way not without now</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.000" end="00:30:33.020" style="s2">with an effort of consensus both of us</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.620" end="00:30:34.460" style="s2">just said hey you know my energy to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.020" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">karaoke push this thing forward is no</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.460" end="00:30:41.090" style="s2">longer enough said okay let&#39;s move this</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.200" style="s2">into spore mode that&#39;s not let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.090" end="00:30:43.820" style="s2">what happens if we just sort of each</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.200" end="00:30:46.130" style="s2">individual who&#39;s been part of it takes</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.820" end="00:30:47.809" style="s2">what they take it goes out and we kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.130" end="00:30:50.330" style="s2">of go out and try to carry the ethos and</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.809" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">the aesthetics and the sense of ability</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.330" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">out into the world what happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:31:00.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s what happened that&#39;s way too</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.750" end="00:31:01.610" style="s2">so call it 2013 ish maybe I&#39;m often the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.020" end="00:31:05.180" style="s2">dates by the way I don&#39;t claim anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.610" end="00:31:06.740" style="s2">vaguely like chronological precision</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.180" end="00:31:08.390" style="s2">it definitely wasn&#39;t 1920 and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.740" end="00:31:11.270" style="s2">definitely wasn&#39;t 2300 somewhere between</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.390" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">those two sport mode with kicked in and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.270" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">I went off and by the way Bonanza who</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:18.470" style="s2">was part of it as well went up on our</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:19.910" style="s2">journey and everybody else kind of did</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.470" end="00:31:21.470" style="s2">their thing and it&#39;s interesting like if</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.910" end="00:31:23.150" style="s2">you tracked the people in their journeys</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.470" end="00:31:24.350" style="s2">they&#39;ve been interesting very</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.150" end="00:31:25.700" style="s2">interesting journeys that each of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.350" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">individuals are many of the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.700" end="00:31:32.630" style="s2">have taken in that time frame you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">Brett for example has had a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.630" end="00:31:38.300" style="s2">move from a painfully obscure</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:42.140" style="s2">evolutionary theorist and it painfully</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.140" end="00:31:47.570" style="s2">who&#39;s you know schooling Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.390" end="00:31:49.970" style="s2">and I think finally at long last the</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:54.860" style="s2">the more fundamental concepts that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.070" end="00:31:56.270" style="s2">been holding now for two decades seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.860" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">to be coming right it&#39;ll be great</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.270" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">because its major upgrades are possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:04.190" style="s2">right now in his discipline and he has</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.750" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">them so him sharing there would be I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.190" end="00:32:08.510" style="s2">think quite useful</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:10.280" style="s2">what brought you sort of out into the</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.690" end="00:32:26.650" style="s2">how does anything happen and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.659" style="s2">to answer the question I think what</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.460" end="00:32:37.020" style="s2">occurred to me this is never get to this</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.659" end="00:32:39.299" style="s2">self referential one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.020" end="00:32:45.210" style="s2">happen in the context of my journey in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.299" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">sport mode was a nearly reckless</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.210" end="00:32:55.230" style="s2">commitment to Reno vation diving in to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">the possibilities of growth possibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:33:03.419" style="s2">of change which you&#39;ve opposed</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:05.640" style="s2">personally yeah personally yeah listen</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.419" end="00:33:08.659" style="s2">pretty soon pretty intensely I was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.640" end="00:33:08.659" style="s2">of commitment let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.770" end="00:33:15.270" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like as a question as an</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.260" end="00:33:17.250" style="s2">inquiry it&#39;s like what&#39;s possible in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.270" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">this direction like coming largely from</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.250" end="00:33:25.169" style="s2">the background that would have said</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:26.789" style="s2">interior is medium interest exterior is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.169" end="00:33:30.090" style="s2">most of the heavy lifting lives but</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.789" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">actually finding myself very aware of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.090" end="00:33:32.610" style="s2">the meaningfulness of always being</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:33.990" style="s2">scented by the folks who are speaking</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.610" end="00:33:35.610" style="s2">with the interior so that I&#39;ll just do</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.990" end="00:33:36.090" style="s2">it it I&#39;ll dive in I&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.610" end="00:33:37.289" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.090" end="00:33:38.190" style="s2">sorry just back sigh can you get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.289" end="00:33:40.110" style="s2">little bit I&#39;m curious about one thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.190" end="00:33:43.350" style="s2">do you think you were drawn to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.110" end="00:33:45.510" style="s2">intense inner work that you were drawn</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.350" end="00:33:47.250" style="s2">to as a consequence of the schism that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.510" end="00:33:49.890" style="s2">appeared in gang be between the inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.250" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">yeah for sure yeah there are three</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.890" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">things going on one was my own outer</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">life was falling apart so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:59.640" style="s2">having a divorce and a lots of others</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:03.720" style="s2">sort of fall out so I was painfully</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.640" end="00:34:05.610" style="s2">aware of the fact that who I was how I</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.720" end="00:34:07.020" style="s2">was showing up in the world was not</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.610" end="00:34:09.629" style="s2">working so there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.020" end="00:34:11.250" style="s2">interior that either this whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.629" end="00:34:13.619" style="s2">just a show we all kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.250" end="00:34:14.820" style="s2">or you can&#39;t actually change something</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.619" end="00:34:16.679" style="s2">about yourself and you can actually live</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.820" end="00:34:18.450" style="s2">a life that feels meaningful and at</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.679" end="00:34:21.570" style="s2">least Pleasant so that&#39;s one part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.450" end="00:34:23.820" style="s2">super intense right and that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.570" end="00:34:25.139" style="s2">happening in this same timeframe for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.820" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">long time it&#39;s been happening but it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.139" end="00:34:30.780" style="s2">kind of becoming increasingly intense so</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:35.399" style="s2">the second is that now I&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.780" end="00:34:37.859" style="s2">context where by the way the the ability</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.399" end="00:34:42.929" style="s2">to turn away from that was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.859" end="00:34:44.909" style="s2">increasingly dishonorable now in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.929" end="00:34:48.839" style="s2">context what we&#39;re doing in game be it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.909" end="00:34:51.330" style="s2">was not just you know my happy home it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.839" end="00:34:52.919" style="s2">was 2 degree to which I&#39;m playing a role</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.330" end="00:34:54.300" style="s2">or trying to participate in something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.919" end="00:34:54.899" style="s2">that may actually be much larger than</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.300" end="00:34:58.980" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.899" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not just dishonouring my own life</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.980" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">and my family I&#39;m also dishonouring</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.570" end="00:35:07.250" style="s2">whatever this might be and that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:10.250" style="s2">another heavy thing and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.250" end="00:35:13.130" style="s2">to encounter people who are connecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.250" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">with me at a very human level and was</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.130" end="00:35:17.030" style="s2">awakening in media with the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:19.250" style="s2">that you know small shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.030" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">relationality can actually make huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.250" end="00:35:23.420" style="s2">differences in who you are which can</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">make huge differences in how you show up</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.420" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">which then makes huge differences in</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:29.630" style="s2">what you actually end up bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:32.090" style="s2">world so all those were coming in at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.630" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">same time and then a heavy dose of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.090" end="00:35:36.619" style="s2">was then Vanessa coming in with a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2">similar arc and she also having a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.619" end="00:35:43.190" style="s2">divorce in more or less the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.660" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">timeframe and she came in with a huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.190" end="00:35:48.530" style="s2">amount of self change that wanted needed</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">to happen and so our relationship was</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.530" end="00:35:52.820" style="s2">sort of like on that like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:54.230" style="s2">co-evolutionary commitment of let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.820" end="00:35:57.410" style="s2">know put all the chips in and see what</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.230" end="00:36:00.050" style="s2">happens that must be awesome that must</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.410" end="00:36:01.490" style="s2">be good great foundation for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.050" end="00:36:02.690" style="s2">relationship right it really gets to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.490" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">know each other well quickly I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:07.580" style="s2">imagine yeah absolutely yeah it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:09.890" style="s2">eye-opening actually just to do the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.580" end="00:36:11.300" style="s2">Delta between how much you really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.890" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">get to know someone how much you can get</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.300" end="00:36:15.109" style="s2">to know yourself hmm and even just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:16.220" style="s2">the simple insight bit until you truly</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.109" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">have learned how to love yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.220" end="00:36:21.349" style="s2">cannot love someone else like until you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.310" end="00:36:22.820" style="s2">actually have that hit like whoa and of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.349" end="00:36:24.230" style="s2">course once you do get that hit and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.820" end="00:36:26.570" style="s2">realize the difference between that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.230" end="00:36:31.010" style="s2">I guess you would call it narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.570" end="00:36:32.210" style="s2">which is the simulation of that those</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.010" end="00:36:33.710" style="s2">are all things that come when you hit</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.210" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">the you know the temperature levels high</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.710" end="00:36:36.500" style="s2">enough things melt and getting the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:38.300" style="s2">temperature high enough boom the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.500" end="00:36:38.690" style="s2">crucible opens and then real things come</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.300" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.690" end="00:36:42.710" style="s2">no and one of the things that happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:45.770" style="s2">the consequence of that a journey was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.710" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">building of a particular capacity of how</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.770" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">to sense what is the the choice that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:58.710" style="s2">the most effective in the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.500" end="00:37:02.339" style="s2">might call it apply to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.710" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">or something like that I think recently</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.339" end="00:37:07.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve been calling it flowing in hyper</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:10.230" style="s2">complexity or flexing the muscles of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.980" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">hyper complexity like I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">in a conversation with a guy sends stock</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.180" end="00:37:18.150" style="s2">a few days ago and so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:21.330" style="s2">like that capacity that that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.150" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">how to sense what is being called for in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.330" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">the moment on the basis of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:28.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m perceiving the whole perception</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:30.990" style="s2">that I have and the basis of how my</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.470" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">relevance realization system identifies</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.990" end="00:37:36.390" style="s2">that so the end the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:38.099" style="s2">question is it may not be satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.390" end="00:37:39.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of generally true to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.099" end="00:37:42.839" style="s2">every possible version of that question</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.980" end="00:37:46.460" style="s2">but I could just say like the the local</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.839" end="00:37:46.460" style="s2">reality I&#39;ll give you an example I</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.490" end="00:37:55.190" style="s2">hadn&#39;t written anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.060" end="00:37:59.990" style="s2">publicly and Vanessa said I should write</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.190" end="00:38:00.790" style="s2">something publicly and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.990" end="00:38:02.080" style="s2">initially</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.790" end="00:38:04.420" style="s2">took a couple of the articles that I had</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.080" end="00:38:07.300" style="s2">written and shared them on a a group</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:11.290" style="s2">called deviant art because my friend</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.300" end="00:38:12.730" style="s2">Angela created deviantART and is both</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.290" end="00:38:13.960" style="s2">there was some interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.730" end="00:38:15.550" style="s2">there was also a lot of not interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.960" end="00:38:19.090" style="s2">conversation so I wasn&#39;t super motivated</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.550" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">and then another buddy of mine I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.090" end="00:38:23.590" style="s2">be GK more left at the same time nudged</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:25.990" style="s2">me as well and there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.590" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">the synchrony of the timing like there</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.990" end="00:38:31.210" style="s2">was no obvious background behind both of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">them and the way that they show up is</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.210" end="00:38:34.840" style="s2">very different but he was a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.950" style="s2">mine from fourth grade and bio</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.840" end="00:38:37.600" style="s2">collaborator in a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.950" end="00:38:39.970" style="s2">initiatives I&#39;ve done in my adult life</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.600" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">and you know she&#39;s my my life partner</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.970" end="00:38:43.450" style="s2">they both the way they kind of nudged me</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:45.030" style="s2">kicked me into an energy level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.450" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">endeavor and to actually write something</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.030" end="00:38:50.140" style="s2">or the purposes of being received by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:53.140" style="s2">public but I&#39;m very experimental I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.140" end="00:38:55.390" style="s2">tell you I was very it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.140" end="00:38:58.330" style="s2">truculent and in stepping into that like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.390" end="00:39:02.500" style="s2">I had no the opposite of desire to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.330" end="00:39:04.380" style="s2">actually be successful well sorry to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.500" end="00:39:07.690" style="s2">popular is that their way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.380" end="00:39:08.770" style="s2">if four or five people read it and felt</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.690" end="00:39:10.870" style="s2">like it was useful that was I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.770" end="00:39:12.970" style="s2">consider that success is a million</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.870" end="00:39:16.090" style="s2">people read it and just made in they</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.970" end="00:39:17.470" style="s2">completely it made them less effective</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.090" end="00:39:21.700" style="s2">or they actually took it the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.470" end="00:39:23.500" style="s2">so that would be terrible and so and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.700" end="00:39:25.860" style="s2">here&#39;s the case then of that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.500" end="00:39:31.330" style="s2">feeling like how do you actually follow</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.860" end="00:39:32.530" style="s2">the Equality of rightness and noticing</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.330" end="00:39:34.600" style="s2">and I mean and I think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.530" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">actually take a look at my writings and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.600" end="00:39:39.790" style="s2">by the way if you just take a look like</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:41.230" style="s2">literally Who I am my participatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.790" end="00:39:44.990" style="s2">knowing how I am showing up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.230" end="00:39:45.980" style="s2">because now there&#39;s a enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.990" end="00:39:51.230" style="s2">trace of that that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.980" end="00:39:54.760" style="s2">witness it publicly the feeling of when</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.230" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">a particular mode of expression created</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.760" end="00:39:59.300" style="s2">possibilities of relationality meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:01.580" style="s2">people responded in a way that had an</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.300" end="00:40:04.430" style="s2">increasing feeling of rightness in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.580" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">way that they responded oriented me more</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.430" end="00:40:09.109" style="s2">towards how to hone and shift my own who</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:11.710" style="s2">I was so that I could continue to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.109" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">express more in a way that increased the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.710" end="00:40:14.869" style="s2">quality of the way that it landed which</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:16.520" style="s2">increased the quality of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.869" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">they responded and who they were and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.520" end="00:40:21.980" style="s2">their own participatory knowing and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:24.170" style="s2">then becomes a co-evolutionary dance and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.980" end="00:40:28.190" style="s2">you get this sort of triadic movement</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.170" end="00:40:32.089" style="s2">where there&#39;s a my discernment increases</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.190" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">my capacity which then increases my</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.089" end="00:40:36.770" style="s2">expression which then to some extent to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.240" end="00:40:39.470" style="s2">degree which my quality of expression</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.770" end="00:40:42.830" style="s2">solid increases the capacity in the in</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.470" end="00:40:47.230" style="s2">the other which then generates in them a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.830" end="00:40:49.550" style="s2">response which then my discernment can</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.230" end="00:40:51.530" style="s2">signal-to-noise differentiate it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.550" end="00:40:52.910" style="s2">in some way which increases my</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.530" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">discernment because I now have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.910" end="00:40:57.109" style="s2">differential between input and output my</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.710" end="00:41:00.950" style="s2">destroyer was like oh okay it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.109" end="00:41:02.630" style="s2">looks then it creates a loop and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.950" end="00:41:04.070" style="s2">it&#39;s notice the coordination there</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.630" end="00:41:06.040" style="s2">between we were saying earlier with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.070" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">Venus Project</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.040" end="00:41:09.970" style="s2">Oh what they&#39;ve self-reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:11.860" style="s2">feedback loop into the Commons and ants</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.970" end="00:41:14.260" style="s2">again sort of thing yeah yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.860" end="00:41:15.670" style="s2">mapping it&#39;s actually a mapping so one</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.260" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">The Venus Project is talking about it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.670" end="00:41:19.660" style="s2">the context of energy and here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:22.210" style="s2">talking about in the context of say</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.660" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">pattern or discernment um communication</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.210" end="00:41:26.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a mapping that they&#39;re identical</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">to the same topology and then something</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.890" end="00:41:32.890" style="s2">like rebel wisdom shows up like I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:34.810" style="s2">go out to David you know who he was at</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">all he reached out to me I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.810" end="00:41:38.760" style="s2">remember exactly what the context wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:38.760" style="s2">he was an email</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.530" end="00:41:42.620" style="s2">can we chat it would be interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.240" end="00:41:44.330" style="s2">us to chat here&#39;s something that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.620" end="00:41:46.190" style="s2">and here&#39;s what I did</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.330" end="00:41:47.960" style="s2">I&#39;m meditated I meditate every day and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.190" end="00:41:49.880" style="s2">in the context of my meditation I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.960" end="00:41:52.280" style="s2">sort of brought in the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.880" end="00:41:53.510" style="s2">that and felt that it feel like it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.280" end="00:41:54.860" style="s2">the rightness to it could it feel like</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.510" end="00:41:56.120" style="s2">there was a rightness to it and was</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.860" end="00:41:58.550" style="s2">there any boundary conditions like did</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.120" end="00:42:00.920" style="s2">some part of myself back but some part</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.550" end="00:42:03.710" style="s2">of me like not really could I say with</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.920" end="00:42:05.900" style="s2">like a whole wholeness of self I say yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.710" end="00:42:07.790" style="s2">to this possibility with the wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.900" end="00:42:10.190" style="s2">of self and what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.790" end="00:42:11.780" style="s2">this is that it&#39;s not magic like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.190" end="00:42:14.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually know he&#39;s gonna record</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.780" end="00:42:15.500" style="s2">the damn thing I didn&#39;t know that he was</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.360" end="00:42:17.300" style="s2">making a documentary and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.500" end="00:42:18.950" style="s2">documentarian I didn&#39;t know that he was</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.300" end="00:42:21.260" style="s2">gonna take me like I don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.950" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">sitting out of my front stoop with my</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.260" end="00:42:26.090" style="s2">laptop wearing my bathrobe spewing</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:28.130" style="s2">whatever nonsense happened to come to my</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.090" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">mat face at the moment and appended to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.130" end="00:42:31.070" style="s2">the beginning of the documentary that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:32.120" style="s2">was making that Jordan Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.070" end="00:42:36.340" style="s2">thought we were just having a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.120" end="00:42:39.170" style="s2">conversation so it&#39;s not like I knew</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.340" end="00:42:41.600" style="s2">that it was a good idea but what I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.170" end="00:42:45.230" style="s2">say is that my wisdom the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.600" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">which I had perceived what degrees I had</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.230" end="00:42:49.310" style="s2">good perception which in this case was</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:52.010" style="s2">clearly wanting and the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.310" end="00:42:53.360" style="s2">I can build good instincts definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.010" end="00:42:54.830" style="s2">left me to a wholeness of self saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.360" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">yes maybe no part of me given what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.830" end="00:42:58.190" style="s2">knew is saying no and some part of me</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.920" style="s2">probably should&#39;ve asked better question</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:03.670" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a learning but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.920" end="00:43:05.260" style="s2">they ask better questions but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.670" end="00:43:06.970" style="s2">net-net it seems like it kind of worked</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.260" end="00:43:08.920" style="s2">out so maybe I&#39;m okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.970" end="00:43:10.810" style="s2">and I they&#39;re just the part of me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.920" end="00:43:14.500" style="s2">would ask better questions mmm still</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.810" end="00:43:19.750" style="s2">hasn&#39;t grown any we call it strength in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.500" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">the larger society of selves so and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.750" end="00:43:22.330" style="s2">conversation is to that point exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:25.120" style="s2">like you&#39;ve actually had things</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.330" end="00:43:26.140" style="s2">mentioned many times and I imagine this</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.120" end="00:43:28.270" style="s2">is actually something having to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.140" end="00:43:31.240" style="s2">your own interior and your sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.270" end="00:43:33.010" style="s2">but you know why am I having this</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.240" end="00:43:34.510" style="s2">conversation with you yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.010" end="00:43:37.000" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.510" end="00:43:38.650" style="s2">thousands and millions of viewers so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.000" end="00:43:41.080" style="s2">here&#39;s some thing because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.650" end="00:43:43.090" style="s2">question you&#39;re asking actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.080" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">us here brings out some stuff that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.090" end="00:43:47.250" style="s2">because my prove useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:49.470" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.250" end="00:43:56.090" style="s2">so one of the things that I noticed when</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.470" end="00:43:59.640" style="s2">you contacted me was something about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.090" end="00:44:02.250" style="s2">it&#39;s weird it&#39;s like the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.640" end="00:44:03.450" style="s2">language you can tell the difference I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.250" end="00:44:05.580" style="s2">think it&#39;s this is not even slightly</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.450" end="00:44:07.790" style="s2">ambiguous you can tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.580" end="00:44:07.790" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.140" end="00:44:13.970" style="s2">a marketer and somebody who is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.750" end="00:44:15.380" style="s2">communicating with you you can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.970" end="00:44:17.090" style="s2">you can absolutely feel it but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.380" end="00:44:19.700" style="s2">consciousness that is behind something</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:21.560" style="s2">is evident into something it bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.700" end="00:44:25.550" style="s2">between the letters in between the lines</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:28.510" style="s2">yeah yeah and so when I when you I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.550" end="00:44:32.630" style="s2">wrote to me I&#39;m pretty sure you wrote I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.510" end="00:44:34.100" style="s2">could feel that the consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.630" end="00:44:37.750" style="s2">was expressing itself through those</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.100" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">words to me was a consciousness that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.750" end="00:44:43.300" style="s2">well at the very least worth taking the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:48.530" style="s2">risk of communicating with a little more</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.300" end="00:44:51.740" style="s2">right and then in every interaction that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.530" end="00:44:53.270" style="s2">I had with your consciousness mediated</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.740" end="00:44:56.590" style="s2">by the various expressions that you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.270" end="00:44:58.840" style="s2">I think I watched</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.590" end="00:45:01.960" style="s2">one video that you did maybe I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.840" end="00:45:03.460" style="s2">even do that okay I contacted you to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.960" end="00:45:05.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve used some of your ideas in a video</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.460" end="00:45:07.540" style="s2">if you want to take a look at yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.290" end="00:45:09.370" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right I did and as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.540" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">listened to it what I felt was integrity</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.370" end="00:45:13.120" style="s2">and what I mean by integrity what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:16.330" style="s2">is that the things that you that I had</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.120" end="00:45:19.000" style="s2">shared that you are now sharing back had</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.330" end="00:45:20.860" style="s2">maintained their truth to the readers I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.000" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">was expressing truth at all you were not</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.860" end="00:45:25.300" style="s2">diluting but we&#39;re in fact reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:27.490" style="s2">and increasing that truth for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.300" end="00:45:29.500" style="s2">it like at that point I&#39;m done I will</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.490" end="00:45:31.510" style="s2">definitely support that in world and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.500" end="00:45:34.150" style="s2">anybody who can do that to the rich I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.510" end="00:45:36.280" style="s2">have the resources to do so you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.150" end="00:45:37.000" style="s2">have so many minutes in the day and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.280" end="00:45:38.590" style="s2">would support that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.000" end="00:45:39.940" style="s2">and so then it&#39;s a yes the whole list of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.590" end="00:45:42.520" style="s2">stuff actually left it to it yes so for</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.940" end="00:45:44.170" style="s2">me this has not been a question of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.520" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">begrudging it&#39;s more than a question of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:50.290" style="s2">here I don&#39;t have a good sort of reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:52.270" style="s2">for why we would have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.290" end="00:45:56.200" style="s2">but I know that it&#39;s a good idea okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.270" end="00:45:56.950" style="s2">good good enough for me that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.200" end="00:45:58.330" style="s2">enough for me too</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.950" end="00:46:01.090" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve done quite a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.330" end="00:46:03.910" style="s2">few broadcasts of one kind or other</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.090" end="00:46:05.350" style="s2">podcasts or YouTube interviews with like</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.910" end="00:46:08.320" style="s2">me people who have very very small</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.350" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">audiences so yeah I mean I it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.320" end="00:46:12.850" style="s2">small sports he&#39;s spreading all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:14.380" style="s2">spools around on you you&#39;ve your</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.850" end="00:46:17.050" style="s2">mushroom is spreading more spores around</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.380" end="00:46:19.600" style="s2">I guess something like that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.050" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh you know how do you what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.600" end="00:46:23.140" style="s2">just what&#39;s the right thing to do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.890" style="s2">to me it&#39;s as simple as that like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.140" end="00:46:28.390" style="s2">not I&#39;m not trying to plan anything well</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.890" end="00:46:29.470" style="s2">I am planning some things but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.390" end="00:46:31.330" style="s2">in this demand I&#39;m not planning anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.470" end="00:46:32.350" style="s2">and I&#39;m just trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.330" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">the right thing to do they just tried</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.350" end="00:46:36.089" style="s2">always go in that direction of what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">the right choice</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.089" end="00:46:41.099" style="s2">and it&#39;s not easy now all the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:44.130" style="s2">recent example is that when a guy and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.099" end="00:46:48.539" style="s2">were talking he asked to record it and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.130" end="00:46:49.949" style="s2">said sure and in during most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.539" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">frame that we were talking it was very</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.949" end="00:46:53.819" style="s2">much an intimate her stood a person</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.969" style="s2">conversation it was very intimate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.819" end="00:46:58.739" style="s2">yeah and the feeling like the container</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.969" end="00:46:59.880" style="s2">was the container there was just an</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.739" end="00:47:02.969" style="s2">Internet person to person conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.880" end="00:47:06.390" style="s2">and but as we got to the end I had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.969" end="00:47:08.039" style="s2">distinct feeling of well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.390" end="00:47:13.259" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot of stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.039" end="00:47:14.819" style="s2">there that is let&#39;s call it messy or</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.259" end="00:47:17.969" style="s2">what unattractive might be another term</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.819" end="00:47:21.229" style="s2">so part of me feels each with that being</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.969" end="00:47:23.700" style="s2">out there but on the other hand if he</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.229" end="00:47:25.230" style="s2">earnestly felt you</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.700" end="00:47:26.579" style="s2">his you know in his wisdom from his</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.230" end="00:47:29.490" style="s2">perspective that it was worth and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.579" end="00:47:30.990" style="s2">reasonable to share that I would support</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.490" end="00:47:33.060" style="s2">that and so of course I specifically</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.990" end="00:47:34.349" style="s2">said that near the end and then he did</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.060" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">and I know how many people who watched</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.349" end="00:47:37.560" style="s2">it they may only been like nine people</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:40.760" style="s2">but the point is it&#39;s out there right</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.560" end="00:47:40.760" style="s2">and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:46.180" style="s2">is a tightrope walk this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.210" end="00:47:48.430" style="s2">thing where it&#39;s like parenting a child</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.180" end="00:47:52.270" style="s2">where you&#39;re definitely it up</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.430" end="00:47:54.430" style="s2">all the time and hopefully also you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.270" end="00:47:55.960" style="s2">getting it right all the time and your</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.430" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">job is just to try to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.960" end="00:47:59.980" style="s2">continue to sort of get better as it</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:01.960" style="s2">gets hard move forward so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.980" end="00:48:06.760" style="s2">ahead of the curve and you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.960" end="00:48:08.890" style="s2">like on some up gradient yeah what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.760" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">liked about that conversant all of it I</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.890" end="00:48:11.619" style="s2">watched about half an hour forty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">of it something like that it&#39;s only been</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.619" end="00:48:14.890" style="s2">up a couple of days I just stumbled</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.839" style="s2">across it yesterday what I like about</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.890" end="00:48:21.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not the content so much but what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.839" end="00:48:23.950" style="s2">liked about it was the the very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.430" end="00:48:28.510" style="s2">and deliberate effort that both of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.950" end="00:48:30.130" style="s2">were making to recognize fully the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.510" end="00:48:34.119" style="s2">and what they were saying and what they</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.130" end="00:48:36.819" style="s2">were feeling and vocalizing what your</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.119" end="00:48:40.150" style="s2">emotional response was and how that then</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.819" end="00:48:42.339" style="s2">leads to a more sort of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.150" end="00:48:44.890" style="s2">response and and so even though the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.339" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">content of what you said was I must</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.890" end="00:48:47.799" style="s2">admit I can&#39;t remember a single thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:49.329" style="s2">that you said in terms of what you said</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.799" end="00:48:52.230" style="s2">but I bet I remember very clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.329" end="00:48:54.460" style="s2">the feeling of the exchange and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.230" end="00:48:56.859" style="s2">even though as you say in places it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.460" end="00:49:01.150" style="s2">feels a bit I don&#39;t know awkward clumsy</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.859" end="00:49:03.010" style="s2">embarrassing whatever but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.150" end="00:49:03.940" style="s2">think that modality is really important</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.010" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.940" end="00:49:08.770" style="s2">rule Omega and tell me tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">think of this because I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.770" end="00:49:11.770" style="s2">been sort of phrasing this for a while</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:17.160" style="s2">so tell me what you think of this that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.770" end="00:49:20.380" style="s2">rule Omega is one of the or perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.160" end="00:49:23.170" style="s2">generator function which if installed</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.380" end="00:49:27.789" style="s2">and run and sufficient nodes in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.170" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">network would bring about the playing of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.789" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2">game B yeah absolutely and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2">you said it was just right</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.650" end="00:49:38.999" style="s2">yeah so I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.900" end="00:49:41.730" style="s2">modality of communication even though</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.999" end="00:49:43.499" style="s2">it&#39;s to me personally and this is my</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.730" end="00:49:46.380" style="s2">thing I completely get that to me first</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.499" end="00:49:49.410" style="s2">personally it feels a little bit overly</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.380" end="00:49:52.980" style="s2">touchy feely new agey kind of creepy</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.410" end="00:49:55.859" style="s2">sometimes you know what I mean but but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.980" end="00:49:59.220" style="s2">get that discomfort is entirely my</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.859" end="00:50:03.150" style="s2">internal thing I I do get that I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.220" end="00:50:05.940" style="s2">a lot of work to do in that area and but</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.150" end="00:50:07.650" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d but I do know Sookie crucial so</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.940" end="00:50:09.150" style="s2">yeah even if you don&#39;t feel great about</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.650" end="00:50:11.309" style="s2">I think it&#39;s important stuff that kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.150" end="00:50:14.339" style="s2">of thing well yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.309" end="00:50:16.380" style="s2">you&#39;re the way I think you said it just</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.339" end="00:50:18.539" style="s2">right and everything I had quite liked I</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.380" end="00:50:20.490" style="s2">had a strong positive feeling as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.539" end="00:50:22.279" style="s2">were talking and actually several</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.490" end="00:50:24.660" style="s2">distinct it&#39;s a strong positive to them</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.279" end="00:50:26.759" style="s2">and I think that this distinction made</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.660" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">between the content and the maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.759" end="00:50:32.460" style="s2">form of the the Wayne asst I think you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">nailed it exactly like the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.460" end="00:50:35.999" style="s2">that we talked about may have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:37.980" style="s2">particularly meaningful to us and it may</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.999" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">not be meaningful to anybody else but in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.980" end="00:50:43.589" style="s2">particularly the way the guy was doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:45.569" style="s2">what he was doing I am I was quite</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.589" end="00:50:47.339" style="s2">touched by like Wow holy cow at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.569" end="00:50:49.650" style="s2">masterful level as far as in my own</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.339" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">personal experience he was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.650" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like really allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:57.210" style="s2">space of the conversation to be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.799" style="s2">perceiving the things that I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.210" end="00:51:00.539" style="s2">perceive to allow it to actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.799" end="00:51:02.670" style="s2">continue to open and deepen and become</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.539" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">more and more rich and then I think has</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.670" end="00:51:07.259" style="s2">actually been a stronger characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">a rule Amega I was like I swear to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.259" end="00:51:13.890" style="s2">good dance partner something like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:15.480" style="s2">whoo yeah that was great so that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.890" end="00:51:17.549" style="s2">was actually specifically it that I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.480" end="00:51:19.499" style="s2">hoping would land if he decided to share</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.549" end="00:51:22.710" style="s2">it I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that I or he</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.499" end="00:51:27.470" style="s2">said anything that was specifically at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.710" end="00:51:27.470" style="s2">Content level needing to be shared but</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.559" end="00:51:32.839" style="s2">more being able to do the thing he was</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.300" end="00:52:54.590" style="s2">culture and the phrase this sounds and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.180" end="00:52:56.930" style="s2">possibly pompous which I suppose there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.930" end="00:52:59.410" style="s2">well for sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.890" end="00:53:03.339" style="s2">I would go the opposite direction which</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.269" end="00:53:26.460" style="s2">about will find themselves more easily</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.430" end="00:53:28.869" style="s2">brought into the world you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.460" end="00:53:30.729" style="s2">having like an adequate level of</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.729" end="00:53:37.499" style="s2">think is yours to share but the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.890" end="00:53:39.999" style="s2">not to have the self doubt or self</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.499" end="00:53:41.979" style="s2">limiting narrative that prevents you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.999" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">from sharing it but the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.979" end="00:53:49.299" style="s2">humility the truth that you are only a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:50.619" style="s2">vessel and you are here really just to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.299" end="00:53:51.519" style="s2">do the work of making it possible for</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.619" end="00:53:54.940" style="s2">that which wants to express itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.519" end="00:53:56.920" style="s2">through you to be truly heard and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.940" end="00:53:58.809" style="s2">have nothing to do with it so get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.920" end="00:54:01.660" style="s2"> out of the way and let that come</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.809" end="00:54:03.999" style="s2">through that&#39;s what you&#39;re here for</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.660" end="00:54:05.340" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe a way of getting through</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.999" end="00:54:07.620" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.340" end="00:54:09.540" style="s2">yeah I get that it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.620" end="00:54:11.550" style="s2">easy to recognize that which is coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.540" end="00:54:14.010" style="s2">through from that which is your own</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.550" end="00:54:16.110" style="s2">stuff but yeah that&#39;s bad that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.010" end="00:54:19.230" style="s2">skill that&#39;s real if you can get there</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.110" end="00:54:22.380" style="s2">then it hits nicely that&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.230" end="00:54:24.090" style="s2">thing to be able to share - yeah I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.380" end="00:54:24.890" style="s2">really so launches to do another one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.090" end="00:54:27.750" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.890" end="00:54:29.190" style="s2">yes that&#39;s nice let&#39;s do it well long</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.750" end="00:54:31.020" style="s2">the pace is probably gonna slow down a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.190" end="00:54:33.720" style="s2">bit because I&#39;ve got some other things</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.020" end="00:54:37.230" style="s2">coming under my under my calendar like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.720" end="00:54:41.360" style="s2">said my expectations are low so alright</p>
