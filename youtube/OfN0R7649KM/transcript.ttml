<p begin="00:00:33.830" end="00:00:39.980" style="s2">managerial guff that overlays the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.640" end="00:00:42.710" style="s2">reality and vividness and vitality of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.980" end="00:00:45.500" style="s2">our lives and come down to the brass</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.710" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">tacks of what&#39;s important and stand up</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.500" end="00:00:49.579" style="s2">for it so thank you to everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:50.810" style="s2">tuned in to livestream last night and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.579" end="00:00:52.630" style="s2">also thank you to everyone who came to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.810" end="00:00:55.190" style="s2">the event we sold out which was great</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.630" end="00:00:56.810" style="s2">the level of conversation in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.190" end="00:00:59.180" style="s2">livestream was brilliant was actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.810" end="00:01:00.860" style="s2">really funny lots of fun and the quality</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.180" end="00:01:03.290" style="s2">of the questions was also excellent and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.860" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">we actually asked Ian some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.290" end="00:01:07.310" style="s2">questions from the live stream like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:10.870" style="s2">one so we&#39;ll take a question from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.310" end="00:01:13.400" style="s2">live stream which is from Jenny Magnus a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.870" end="00:01:17.360" style="s2">consistent thread through the book is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.400" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">the idea betweenness could even say more</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.360" end="00:01:25.270" style="s2">about what he means by this and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.710" end="00:01:31.000" style="s2">important yes try to do this briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.270" end="00:01:35.540" style="s2">think of an electric current it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.000" end="00:01:39.110" style="s2">manifest between two poles a positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.540" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">and a negative pole it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.110" end="00:01:44.210" style="s2">positive pole it&#39;s not in the negative</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:46.939" style="s2">pole it&#39;s not even in the positive pole</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.210" end="00:01:49.939" style="s2">plus the negative pole nor is it in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.939" end="00:01:52.790" style="s2">space between the two poles because that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.939" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">space is nothing it&#39;s in the hole</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.790" end="00:01:58.310" style="s2">between this of the two poles and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:02.750" style="s2">that brings about at a wholly different</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.310" end="00:02:07.700" style="s2">level a good analogy is music music is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.750" end="00:02:09.129" style="s2">all between this so take a note an</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">a-flat</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.129" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">what does it mean absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:20.269" style="s2">take another one Abby</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:21.620" style="s2">it means absolutely nothing put 30,000</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.269" end="00:02:24.709" style="s2">of these things together and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.620" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">varsity minor mass so what happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.709" end="00:02:29.959" style="s2">there which means a hell of a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.340" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the notes so it must be in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.959" end="00:02:33.829" style="s2">the spaces between the notes but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:35.510" style="s2">spaces between the notes and a melody</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.829" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">are just silence the spaces between</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.510" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">notes in harmony are just silence the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:41.299" style="s2">spaces between the beat of the rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">are not bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.299" end="00:02:45.319" style="s2">what say you put a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:47.359" style="s2">mean nothing together and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.319" end="00:02:48.799" style="s2">spaces that mean nothing together you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.359" end="00:02:51.109" style="s2">find something that means more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.799" end="00:02:53.450" style="s2">almost anything you can experience in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.109" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">the world how does that happen the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.450" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">answer is if you like between this so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:03.739" style="s2">what we underestimate bringing it down</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:07.010" style="s2">to earth is that we are not you know we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.739" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">are not atomistic there is no way in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.010" end="00:03:13.970" style="s2">which I exist independently of all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:15.769" style="s2">you and of all of the the planet and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.970" end="00:03:19.489" style="s2">of the people who came before me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.769" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">indeed in a strange way I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.489" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">something that is to come that is all</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:29.720" style="s2">not in me or in them or in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:33.109" style="s2">gaps between us but is in the between us</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.720" end="00:03:34.639" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by it and it&#39;s thank</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.109" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">you Jenny for raising the point because</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.639" end="00:03:38.870" style="s2">it is absolutely fundamental to my</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">philosophy and it&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.870" end="00:03:43.419" style="s2">talking about what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:45.889" style="s2">earlier that I&#39;m writing about right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.419" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been talking a lot about how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.889" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">do this going forward and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:52.099" style="s2">decided is that we&#39;re going to obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:53.720" style="s2">always stream the talks live on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:55.940" style="s2">so anyone who wants you can tune in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.720" end="00:04:00.139" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to put the film of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.940" end="00:04:02.659" style="s2">talk up on patreon and anyone who&#39;s a $5</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.139" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">plus a month subscriber can watch the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.659" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">talk in its entirety when it&#39;s up there</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:08.389" style="s2">so we&#39;ve actually stolen this format</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:11.659" style="s2">from Sam Harris from any of the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.389" end="00:04:14.479" style="s2">reasons a major one is that a live event</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.659" end="00:04:16.250" style="s2">is it&#39;s quite a different beast to sit</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.479" end="00:04:18.380" style="s2">down interview and we don&#39;t have as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.250" end="00:04:19.789" style="s2">control over the quality of it so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.380" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">event video that we&#39;re showing clips</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.789" end="00:04:24.289" style="s2">with here is not the same as the live</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:25.880" style="s2">feed it&#39;s the it&#39;s the feed from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.289" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">camera that&#39;s running at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.880" end="00:04:29.069" style="s2">so it&#39;s high-res</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">it&#39;s better quality than the live stream</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.069" end="00:04:35.099" style="s2">but as it&#39;s a similar decision as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">said that Sam Harris made which is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.099" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">the best quality content the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:41.129" style="s2">podcasts or the interviews that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">doing where we can definitely sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.129" end="00:04:46.919" style="s2">control the environment that is a sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:50.669" style="s2">of signature dish so we&#39;re going to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.919" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">that out on the main channel and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.669" end="00:04:54.360" style="s2">events which are slightly harder to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">control will be for patrons only</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.360" end="00:04:58.229" style="s2">and generally whenever we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:00.270" style="s2">live event we&#39;re going to have an</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.229" end="00:05:02.039" style="s2">interview with that guests at the foot</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">beforehand we&#39;ll get them in to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.039" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">studio a little bit before the event so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:10.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll have the interview to go up</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">alongside and we also have to think sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.710" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">of long term about how we make this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">sustainable and the way to do that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:20.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve chosen is to really ramp up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">patreon content and increase the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.190" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">of people who are subscribing on patreon</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:28.319" style="s2">so and also at the same time we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">to be taking questions we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.319" end="00:05:33.029" style="s2">involve the community as much as</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:34.139" style="s2">possible in this conversation asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.029" end="00:05:36.419" style="s2">them for questions for our upcoming</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.139" end="00:05:38.219" style="s2">interviews asking the livestream</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.419" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">audience for questions during the live</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.219" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">stream a little bit like this one there</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">play another clip it&#39;s mine no matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:48.029" style="s2">aspects are the same thing what is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">thing well of course we did have a word</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.029" end="00:05:56.060" style="s2">for it but then can I answer with an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:06:00.419" style="s2">analogy everybody knows what water is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.060" end="00:06:03.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a transparent liquid that flows but</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.419" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">there&#39;s also this funny opaque very cold</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.150" end="00:06:08.879" style="s2">substance that is entirely a mobile</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:11.750" style="s2">ice there is also this absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.879" end="00:06:15.839" style="s2">invisible something in the air which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.750" end="00:06:20.069" style="s2">also water vapor so water exists in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.839" end="00:06:23.639" style="s2">different phases which of them is water</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.069" end="00:06:25.150" style="s2">they&#39;re all water if you like or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.639" end="00:06:28.130" style="s2">all not water there</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">now I see the relationship very briefly</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.130" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">I&#39;d need a lot longer between matter and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:36.410" style="s2">consciousness as being like this that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:39.320" style="s2">consciousness is as it were the final</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.410" end="00:06:40.670" style="s2">substrate matter is something a form of</p>
