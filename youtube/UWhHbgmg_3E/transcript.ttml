<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">awakening from the meeting process how I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">came to that is I am an associate</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">professor of cognitive psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">cognitive science at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">Toronto okay I&#39;m also a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">practitioner and teacher of the past &#39;no</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:23.299" style="s2">matter Tai Chi Chuan related practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.630" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">so I study a lot about the the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.299" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">the intelligence in sight mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">wisdom meaning in life and then that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">connects up to that I&#39;m also in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">cognitive science program I&#39;m yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.820" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">think I&#39;m the teacher that&#39;s been had</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:44.869" style="s2">the longest history at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:44.869" style="s2">Toronto in cognitive science right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">and and the work I do there has to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">with connecting those things I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">spoke to you about especially meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">and intelligence to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.820" style="s2">emerging work coming out of machine</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">learning and artificial intelligence I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.820" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">think I call relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">then how we can use that to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">that sense a deep connection and coupled</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">being coupled to ourselves each other in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">the world that I think is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:15.330" style="s2">the core process were metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">referring to when we use this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">meaning in life we&#39;re trying to point to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">that that sense of connectedness and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">think the the emerging empirical</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">research shows that that&#39;s ultimately is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">these factors of connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:30.960" style="s2">really contribute to people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:34.860" style="s2">meaning in life but I think you can also</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.960" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">understand those in terms of really</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.860" end="00:02:41.430" style="s2">essential processes for our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">agency of fitting us to the world in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.430" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2">appropriate and deep way for affording</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">our cognitive agency and the development</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">of it yeah and so that then leads me</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">into stuff where I overlap with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:59.550" style="s2">work you know at which I&#39;m you do this</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">the way in which people deeply I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.550" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">have you&#39;ve seen any of the talks have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">given on this but the way people deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">use symbols I don&#39;t use symbols in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:10.730" style="s2">ornamental cents a unit I use it in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">sense that I think is very resonant with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.730" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">urban sensitive the imaginal as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">understand it wrong and that that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">that that people are making use of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">symbols to activate and access this</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:28.740" style="s2">profound connectedness that has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">phenomenological experiential aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.740" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">it but also a functional aspect to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:41.490" style="s2">that I call religio and again I see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:46.200" style="s2">resonant with a lot of what I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.490" end="00:03:50.130" style="s2">in Corbin and in your work and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.200" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">that&#39;s all important to the central</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.130" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">project of awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:55.530" style="s2">crisis because I see Corbin along with</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">people like Heidegger of course had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.530" end="00:04:02.360" style="s2">huge influence on Corbin young Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">and Tillich as sort of record of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">the crisis of meaning that we&#39;ve entered</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">into and I&#39;m interested in talking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:17.670" style="s2">you because if that in in I have it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">I think it&#39;s episodes 47 and 48 or 48</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.670" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">and 49 I talk about German yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">and so yeah I haven&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:27.530" style="s2">so busy I haven&#39;t gotten around to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:32.729" style="s2">yet but they&#39;re all busy yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">from trying fam and I get that yeah I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:03.479" style="s2">I you cover a lot of bases that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.970" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.479" end="00:05:09.260" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s you&#39;re in an odd position</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">being in cognitive science yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.260" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">psychology but I had also have explicit</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:22.949" style="s2">educational training in philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">yes well yeah and so and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:27.030" style="s2">the part of philosophy that is most</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:28.260" style="s2">connective between the philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.030" end="00:05:30.930" style="s2">the work they do in cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.260" end="00:05:33.030" style="s2">and even in cognitive sciences ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.930" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">philosophy so of a deep education and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.030" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">sort of Plato photonic schools appear</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">like this stoicism so you can also see</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">there while I&#39;m resonating with Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:55.229" style="s2">so deeply yeah yeah so so I mean where</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:57.330" style="s2">would that the the diamond I met in kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.229" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">of an odd place right now because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.330" end="00:06:05.010" style="s2">think I&#39;m because I think I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.780" end="00:06:06.570" style="s2">starting to be able to walk the talk as</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.010" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">it were</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.570" end="00:06:15.570" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;m so so I&#39;m teaching the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.210" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">teaching online to a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.570" end="00:06:22.470" style="s2">people who you know follow me around</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:27.570" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s and and so what I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.470" end="00:06:33.210" style="s2">with is the same sort of thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.570" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">looking for really good ways to to wake</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.210" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">people up boy it&#39;s right it&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:38.270" style="s2">it&#39;s kind it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:44.730" style="s2">hard to talk about this stuff without</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.270" end="00:06:46.950" style="s2">without using language that has the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.730" end="00:06:52.500" style="s2">wrong connotations or at least that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.950" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">seemed wrong to me but I but there&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.500" end="00:07:02.910" style="s2">to be better ways than I have yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:05.820" style="s2">managed to develop to to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.910" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">around to something which is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.820" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">really very intellectual it can be you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:15.919" style="s2">know but that if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a head</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:18.270" style="s2">person like me that that provides more</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.919" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s more trouble than it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.270" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">in a lot of ways you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:31.470" style="s2">think your way into into meaning I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.960" end="00:07:34.290" style="s2">actually you kind of can but well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.470" end="00:07:38.100" style="s2">actually interesting because that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.290" end="00:07:39.210" style="s2">of the key arguments I consider in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:41.640" style="s2">couple episodes where I talk about</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:11.340" style="s2">I&#39;m saying rest standing or some</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.640" end="00:08:13.140" style="s2">development of gains here right and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.340" end="00:08:14.280" style="s2">the argument that they both make when</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.140" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">they talk about transformative</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.280" end="00:08:18.680" style="s2">experience in its aspiration is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:21.210" style="s2">something you can infer your way through</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.680" end="00:08:23.790" style="s2">they actually have some deep arguments</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:26.040" style="s2">as to why you can&#39;t infer your way</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.790" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">through it but they all but alert in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.040" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">particular makes a very good point about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:34.830" style="s2">this she says look if this process is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">not he&#39;s not ultimately inferential in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.830" end="00:08:41.190" style="s2">nature and we conclude that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:42.390" style="s2">not infrared and so it&#39;s off also not</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.190" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">rational then we&#39;re gonna get into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:47.940" style="s2">weird place because she&#39;s she rightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">points out the aspiration to rationality</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.940" end="00:08:51.890" style="s2">is a clear case</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:54.740" style="s2">aspiration and if we said well</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.890" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">aspiration is not a rational process</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.740" end="00:08:59.060" style="s2">because it&#39;s not an inferential process</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">then we get into a weird performative</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.060" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">contradiction which is a really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:08.540" style="s2">cool move this actually leads me to my</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:09.770" style="s2">peers that are really interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.540" end="00:09:14.390" style="s2">in Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.770" end="00:09:17.570" style="s2">which is the idea that well how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.390" end="00:09:20.090" style="s2">it then how do and then there and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.570" end="00:09:22.250" style="s2">is where I think you know the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.090" end="00:09:25.100" style="s2">relationship to the future self is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.250" end="00:09:27.820" style="s2">an imaginary relationship but an</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.820" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">really interested in because kowler</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">talks about you get into this weird</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:38.390" style="s2">paradox your current self is causing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">that future self but the future self has</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.300" end="00:11:08.370" style="s2">language coming out of like out of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.790" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">break the core of analytic philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.370" end="00:11:13.800" style="s2">one hand and yet you are talking in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.339" end="00:11:16.920" style="s2">way that&#39;s deeply resonant with it and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.800" end="00:11:18.390" style="s2">see Corbin as like affording that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.920" end="00:11:26.310" style="s2">of connection which is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.390" end="00:11:29.399" style="s2">to me well for yeah well we did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.310" end="00:11:31.470" style="s2">this is always yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.399" end="00:11:34.050" style="s2">this and when I&#39;m writing two or three</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.470" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">essays right now and then I&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.050" end="00:11:40.140" style="s2">and so hi so I&#39;m in this but I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:42.390" style="s2">place that is partly pertinent and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">partly not but it is pertinent because</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.390" end="00:11:53.610" style="s2">look for Corbin I think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:56.430" style="s2">that that and any kind of I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.610" end="00:12:02.220" style="s2">this the the archetypal example of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.430" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">knowledge is interpersonal dialogue you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.220" end="00:12:08.790" style="s2">know that one of the central places in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:12.060" style="s2">all of one of the central moments in all</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.790" end="00:12:14.579" style="s2">of his work is in creative imagination</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.060" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">where he talks about the prayer of man</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.579" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">and the prayer of God and says that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:24.870" style="s2">prayer is the supreme form and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:27.180" style="s2">highest act of creative imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.870" end="00:12:29.310" style="s2">and the first time you&#39;d come to that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.180" end="00:12:31.230" style="s2">used his language in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.310" end="00:12:33.690" style="s2">seems obvious that he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.230" end="00:12:38.970" style="s2">making up your own God and yet you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.690" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">that he doesn&#39;t mean that and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.970" end="00:12:44.250" style="s2">and and so so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:47.880" style="s2">archetype of of knowledge for him it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.250" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">always personal and somebody see one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.880" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">the students said the other day well as</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:57.180" style="s2">the is the angel you or is it not you</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.010" end="00:13:00.089" style="s2">and I I wish I knew I wish I knew a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.180" end="00:13:02.910" style="s2">little more about contemporary you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.089" end="00:13:05.250" style="s2">woven us and and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.910" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">because I think what Corbin is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.250" end="00:13:11.010" style="s2">suggesting is has a lot of resonance</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.260" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">with with Lebanon you know you you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.010" end="00:13:16.529" style="s2">the other and the other is you and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:20.519" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly social</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.529" end="00:13:22.679" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this but the other isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.519" end="00:13:25.649" style="s2">just other people it&#39;s also other</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.679" end="00:13:28.949" style="s2">aspects of you of you right in time oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.649" end="00:13:34.169" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re indelibly a historical as</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.949" end="00:13:36.769" style="s2">well oh well for court for Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.169" end="00:13:39.749" style="s2">history yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.769" end="00:13:42.089" style="s2">Corbin&#39;s about you know escaping the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.749" end="00:13:44.699" style="s2">bonds of history but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.089" end="00:13:45.899" style="s2">Gordon wants to deny that you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.699" end="00:13:49.639" style="s2">he&#39;s not trying to deny the high</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.899" end="00:13:49.639" style="s2">daguerreian idea that we&#39;re all so right</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.849" end="00:13:59.459" style="s2">no but what&#39;s important for him wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.759" end="00:14:03.059" style="s2">wait where where does the forecourt by</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.459" end="00:14:05.309" style="s2">the the the I&#39;d almost had a good word</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.059" end="00:14:08.579" style="s2">for this that the substance of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.309" end="00:14:11.339" style="s2">the volume of things the space of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.579" end="00:14:13.829" style="s2">the imagination of things the resonance</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.339" end="00:14:20.099" style="s2">of things the soul of things none of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.829" end="00:14:21.539" style="s2">that comes from history I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.099" end="00:14:23.399" style="s2">trying to break out of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.539" end="00:14:25.819" style="s2">narrative of horizontal history yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.399" end="00:14:29.129" style="s2">right yeah and so they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.819" end="00:14:31.019" style="s2">metaphors I get it that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.129" end="00:14:37.919" style="s2">ontological is sort of vertical for him</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.019" end="00:14:39.479" style="s2">what I meant was though that like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.919" end="00:14:41.099" style="s2">just trying to bring let&#39;s go back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.479" end="00:14:44.249" style="s2">the way I phrased it is the other not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.099" end="00:14:45.449" style="s2">only other people but I&#39;m there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.249" end="00:14:47.269" style="s2">sense of which there&#39;s other to myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.449" end="00:14:49.439" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was trying to point to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.269" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">when I invoked history of history is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.439" end="00:14:57.089" style="s2">wrong word off I&#39;ll take it back because</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:15:02.089" style="s2">yeah because that dr.ali tends to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.089" end="00:15:02.089" style="s2">misread yeah that&#39;s fine and so again</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.179" end="00:15:11.999" style="s2">obviously in Lebanon you see it in use</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.439" end="00:15:16.349" style="s2">and the objective you know the triple L</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.999" end="00:15:18.269" style="s2">ontologies of like that okay well you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.349" end="00:15:20.969" style="s2">see the point is they say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.269" end="00:15:24.119" style="s2">case for every object that we encounter</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.969" end="00:15:26.249" style="s2">every object right is both shining</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.119" end="00:15:28.990" style="s2">towards us in a way but always</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.249" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">withdrawing okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.990" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">in a profound way so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:33.970" style="s2">encounter and I was using this when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:35.950" style="s2">was doing to talk about trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:38.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.950" end="00:15:41.890" style="s2">clear in Corbin but that that really</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.890" end="00:15:43.690" style="s2">that at divine double while I use stangs</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.890" end="00:15:46.089" style="s2">what we&#39;ll come back to in a second on</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.690" end="00:15:47.649" style="s2">double right isn&#39;t just with other</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.089" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">persons it&#39;s with other aspects of</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.630" end="00:16:57.130" style="s2">not just me making up what Corbin is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">saying I think that&#39;s what he&#39;s saying</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.000" end="00:17:19.150" style="s2">this this pencil isn&#39;t very much like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">person but in order to engage with it in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.150" end="00:17:25.480" style="s2">any way at all you have to personify it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:29.050" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a penis it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.480" end="00:17:32.800" style="s2">like a rocket the human puts it this way</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.050" end="00:17:33.430" style="s2">that the anima Mundi is the availability</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.800" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:40.660" style="s2">of puts it on the psychological side and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.740" end="00:17:42.700" style="s2">Corbin says well yeah sure that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.660" end="00:17:47.230" style="s2">but that&#39;s because because everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.700" end="00:17:49.390" style="s2">has an angel so so so did this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.230" end="00:17:51.640" style="s2">there are no objects there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.390" end="00:17:53.410" style="s2">he says and right right at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.640" end="00:17:55.150" style="s2">he says there are no objects</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.410" end="00:17:57.250" style="s2">everything&#39;s a person and he gets that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.150" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">from Zoroaster history at least he</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.250" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">claims to you know you might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:05.740" style="s2">interested in some work I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:07.210" style="s2">currently where you show where you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.740" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">this coming out and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.210" end="00:18:12.010" style="s2">literally rocket scientists so these are</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:15.370" style="s2">people who bring the Rovers around on</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.010" end="00:18:16.840" style="s2">Mars right and in order to move the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.370" end="00:18:20.470" style="s2">Rovers around they&#39;re looking for people</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.840" end="00:18:22.570" style="s2">getting the ability to be on Mars yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.470" end="00:18:24.910" style="s2">so and that&#39;s really difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.570" end="00:18:27.220" style="s2">because of the time lag there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.910" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">control right so they have to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.220" end="00:18:34.750" style="s2">their imagination naj him away and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:36.670" style="s2">what they do is they and vertice in her</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.750" end="00:18:38.920" style="s2">book on seemed like the rover they both</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.670" end="00:18:41.470" style="s2">she uses his meat they cantaloupe they</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.920" end="00:18:49.750" style="s2">both personify the rover but they also</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.470" end="00:18:56.650" style="s2">techno morph eyes themselves bazzill and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.750" end="00:18:58.870" style="s2">they&#39;ll say I I need to do this and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.650" end="00:19:01.090" style="s2">practice to get this loop going</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.870" end="00:19:04.360" style="s2">they couple themselves in an imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.090" end="00:19:06.130" style="s2">sense and over and that kind of I call</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.360" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">that participatory knowing that project</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:14.740" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah it&#39;s like to be on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:15.130" style="s2">Mars and I and only then can they do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.740" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.130" end="00:19:19.510" style="s2">do the skills and then only after doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:21.300" style="s2">the skills do they get to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.510" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">the propositions of the beliefs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.300" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">fantastic but it&#39;s perfect that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:46.690" style="s2">really great yeah that&#39;s fantastic not</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">just being you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.690" end="00:19:51.550" style="s2">they&#39;ll say things like you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.730" end="00:19:53.710" style="s2">gardening and my right hand kept getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.550" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">stuck in the garden and then when I went</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.710" end="00:20:07.720" style="s2">to the lab the Rovers right wheel was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">stuck and they sort of like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.720" end="00:20:12.850" style="s2">interested in what&#39;s going on they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:15.340" style="s2">cognitively obviously but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.850" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">connect that by things like Corvin</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.340" end="00:20:21.160" style="s2">participatory knowing the imaginal -</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:22.900" style="s2">right okay these issues about meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.160" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">because notice what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.900" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re getting a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:28.270" style="s2">extended identity it&#39;s obviously not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">logical extension of identity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.270" end="00:20:31.330" style="s2">they&#39;re doing this thing we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.380" end="00:20:34.570" style="s2">talking about the other nests of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.330" end="00:20:39.190" style="s2">rover is somehow being they&#39;re entering</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.570" end="00:20:40.870" style="s2">into this coupling with it really it</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.190" end="00:20:44.830" style="s2">becomes deeply meaningful to them they</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.870" end="00:20:47.020" style="s2">they get they get deeply you know beyond</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.830" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">utilitarian money and time</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.020" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">oh hell oh yeah now they get deeply</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">worried that&#39;s fantastic yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.300" end="00:21:11.170" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really good story I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.980" end="00:21:12.160" style="s2">to use it in class science conference at</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.170" end="00:21:14.350" style="s2">the University of Toronto I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.160" end="00:21:16.120" style="s2">be mocking buddy and how it exemplifies</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.350" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">all the kinds of knowing that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.120" end="00:21:20.160" style="s2">underneath the propositional knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">how much they&#39;re about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.160" end="00:21:25.420" style="s2">connectedness well one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:27.580" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.420" end="00:21:30.490" style="s2">I&#39;m folk I&#39;ve been interested in for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.580" end="00:21:32.860" style="s2">long time as the kinesthetics the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.490" end="00:21:35.410" style="s2">embodied nature of all the so when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.860" end="00:21:37.050" style="s2">say participatory knowing of course the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.410" end="00:21:42.940" style="s2">obvious point is that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.050" end="00:21:44.650" style="s2">non-participatory knowing I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.940" end="00:21:47.560" style="s2">propositional depends on the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.650" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">for sort of a constraining reasons okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.560" end="00:21:51.100" style="s2">I think the procedural depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.140" style="s2">perspective of for things to come out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.100" end="00:21:54.730" style="s2">like Marlowe Ponte and then I think for</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.140" end="00:21:56.620" style="s2">sort of high daguerreian reasons and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.730" end="00:21:58.300" style="s2">deeper aspects of it consign the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.620" end="00:22:00.020" style="s2">perspective all ultimately depends on</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.300" end="00:22:06.740" style="s2">the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.020" end="00:22:09.540" style="s2">okay okay here&#39;s the address to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.740" end="00:22:12.330" style="s2">what are the things that interests me in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.540" end="00:22:15.860" style="s2">the in the history up now and then and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.330" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">the stuff that I&#39;ve written and my</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.860" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">exemplar of this is Yvonne village just</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">for historical reasons and I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s millions of people now who were</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:27.990" style="s2">working on these sorts of things but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.570" style="s2">not on finite so I&#39;m not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.990" end="00:22:34.800" style="s2">their work but Ilic pointed out a long</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.570" end="00:22:37.580" style="s2">time ago that for instance in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.800" end="00:22:40.530" style="s2">medieval the world people saw and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.580" end="00:22:47.550" style="s2">experienced and smelled and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.530" end="00:22:51.510" style="s2">whole history of sensation business and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.550" end="00:22:58.710" style="s2">and so so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.510" end="00:23:08.430" style="s2">interests me is ways of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.710" end="00:23:15.570" style="s2">getting a an experiential access to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.430" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">fluidity of sensation what&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.570" end="00:23:20.370" style="s2">things poetry and art is about oh I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.930" style="s2">agree that&#39;s why I follow Corbin up in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.370" end="00:23:28.740" style="s2">this series by plucking both far-field</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.930" end="00:23:30.600" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great so one of the points I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.740" end="00:23:33.300" style="s2">was gonna make about how this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.600" end="00:23:36.450" style="s2">relevant to the whole issue about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.300" end="00:23:37.980" style="s2">meeting crisis is and then I also want</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.450" end="00:23:39.270" style="s2">to bring up something a connection to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.980" end="00:23:41.250" style="s2">it&#39;s that you I think you do talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.270" end="00:23:42.750" style="s2">in one of your books but first of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.250" end="00:23:45.420" style="s2">connection to the meaning crisis is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.750" end="00:23:48.090" style="s2">think that that all that sub</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.420" end="00:23:49.950" style="s2">propositional stuff is where most of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.090" end="00:23:51.930" style="s2">connectedness of meaning is being made</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.950" end="00:23:53.790" style="s2">and I think that psychology and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.930" end="00:23:56.730" style="s2">cognitive science is supporting that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.790" end="00:24:01.080" style="s2">as our culture has become in Braille or</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.730" end="00:24:03.420" style="s2">I see tyranny we&#39;ve long yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.080" end="00:24:05.190" style="s2">obviously we still implicitly depend as</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.420" end="00:24:06.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve said on all those other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.190" end="00:24:09.390" style="s2">knowing for a cognitive agency but we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.990" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">culturally cannot validate it or</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.390" end="00:24:13.530" style="s2">celebrate it or access it or educate it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:15.510" style="s2">in any sort of system</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.530" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">way and I think that&#39;s a significant</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.510" end="00:24:20.430" style="s2">contributory because because we try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">do it from the top down yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.430" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">alright yeah ok super you you know do</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">you must know David Abrams first book</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:40.680" style="s2">the spell of the sensuous no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">read it like right now because because</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.680" end="00:24:44.490" style="s2">he can text all this and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:47.490" style="s2">jealous of him for a million years</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.490" end="00:24:49.170" style="s2">because he makes an argument that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.490" end="00:24:51.630" style="s2">a little peculiar on the face of it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.170" end="00:24:54.570" style="s2">it&#39;s very persuasive that this all</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.630" end="00:24:58.800" style="s2">started with alphabet the technology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:25:00.360" style="s2">the alphabet okay okay well be Abram</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.800" end="00:25:01.740" style="s2">Abram was the first time I heard about</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.360" end="00:25:04.680" style="s2">that because he&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.740" end="00:25:07.290" style="s2">introduced me to long and Perry and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.680" end="00:25:09.900" style="s2">an image makes this argument too he does</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.290" end="00:25:12.740" style="s2">it very neatly in a couple of places one</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.900" end="00:25:20.430" style="s2">in the book of human saint-victor the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.740" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">text so Abram and Abram makes a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.430" end="00:25:24.810" style="s2">interesting and I think persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">argument that the the alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.810" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">technology in particular not not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:33.930" style="s2">writing but the alphabet was was</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:41.790" style="s2">profoundly disruptive and drove us all</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.930" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">into our heads you know done extensive</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.790" end="00:25:46.560" style="s2">work on the effects of literacy on</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:53.670" style="s2">cognition and I&#39;m gonna be also talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.560" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">soon yeah people keep people keep trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.670" end="00:25:57.870" style="s2">to get me to read my Gilchrist&#39;s books</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:25:59.970" style="s2">and I just haven&#39;t done it yet but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.870" end="00:26:03.900" style="s2">I gather he says the same kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.970" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s great what&#39;s what&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.900" end="00:26:09.960" style="s2">to me as a scientist is the fact that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:12.570" style="s2">lot of people independently are</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.960" end="00:26:16.830" style="s2">converging on this kind of argument and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.570" end="00:26:19.020" style="s2">this kind of analysis and I pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.830" end="00:26:20.430" style="s2">attention to that I mean I science</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.020" end="00:26:23.250" style="s2">ultimately depends on judgments of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.430" end="00:26:24.990" style="s2">plausibility because we we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.250" end="00:26:27.059" style="s2">can&#39;t consider everything you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.990" end="00:26:30.059" style="s2">infer</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.059" end="00:26:33.629" style="s2">finally being seduced at Tom and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.059" end="00:26:35.999" style="s2">before during and after our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.629" end="00:26:38.279" style="s2">experimentation were dependent on our</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.999" end="00:26:40.830" style="s2">plausibility judgments one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.279" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">the things that makes things more</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:44.789" style="s2">plausible to us as when you get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">independent convergence so I find that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.789" end="00:26:49.499" style="s2">the fact that so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:51.480" style="s2">converging around these points in point</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.499" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">for me it suggests what what Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.480" end="00:26:56.840" style="s2">calls a compass that we&#39;re getting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">getting to a potential you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.840" end="00:27:00.749" style="s2">an event of timing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:03.690" style="s2">not just of time where the course of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.749" end="00:27:05.909" style="s2">things good eventually be altered no</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.690" end="00:27:08.519" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to hear that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.909" end="00:27:12.509" style="s2">great because that confirms you know as</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.519" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">I haven&#39;t been in academia for 25 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.509" end="00:27:19.139" style="s2">or so and so so what I do is I go about</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:22.200" style="s2">my own way and do my own things and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.139" end="00:27:24.299" style="s2">every every decade or so I drop back in</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.200" end="00:27:28.110" style="s2">and look around to see what people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.299" end="00:27:30.149" style="s2">doing and I&#39;ve had that sense that oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.110" end="00:27:32.610" style="s2">yeah well they&#39;re doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.149" end="00:27:34.830" style="s2">over here and over here and isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.610" end="00:27:44.369" style="s2">nice because I think I said that a long</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.830" end="00:27:48.869" style="s2">time ago and and what&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.369" end="00:27:52.169" style="s2">mean I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of stunned at Korriban</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.869" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">and at the relevance of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.169" end="00:28:00.059" style="s2">things that are really central to his</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">vision that are they&#39;re really pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.059" end="00:28:05.850" style="s2">here I mean sometimes you have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:08.580" style="s2">of split to read him in the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.850" end="00:28:12.619" style="s2">want to read him but there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.580" end="00:28:19.470" style="s2">that&#39;s right about the way that he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.619" end="00:28:22.740" style="s2">trying to lead us and and that idea so</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.470" end="00:28:25.980" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s great oh I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.740" end="00:28:29.190" style="s2">guess what I&#39;m bringing to the table</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.980" end="00:28:30.570" style="s2">appears to get you to see and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.190" end="00:28:34.889" style="s2">dropping back in perhaps you&#39;re dropping</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.570" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">back in right now that things that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.889" end="00:28:39.480" style="s2">might not have expected to be converging</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:40.890" style="s2">with Coburn&#39;s Worth are now converging</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.480" end="00:28:47.190" style="s2">with it like what&#39;s called for</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.890" end="00:28:49.260" style="s2">science which I&#39;m an example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.190" end="00:28:51.290" style="s2">part of what I do and I just gave you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.260" end="00:28:53.130" style="s2">some examples of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.290" end="00:28:55.620" style="s2">connections between sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.130" end="00:28:59.820" style="s2">very tough nuts and bolts analytic</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.620" end="00:29:01.530" style="s2">philosophy cognitive science and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:07.710" style="s2">kind of stuff and it&#39;s not a flimsy</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.530" end="00:29:10.530" style="s2">vague kind of connection yeah yeah I try</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.710" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">to argue it explicitly that it is okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.530" end="00:29:25.790" style="s2">alright so I have to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.450" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">your stuff Rodi damn it&#39;s just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.790" end="00:29:32.700" style="s2">because there are so many connections</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">you know life is finite and I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.700" end="00:29:37.950" style="s2">old I mean got me back when I was 30 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.730" end="00:29:40.560" style="s2">40 years old and it was teaching eight</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:43.830" style="s2">courses a year it was pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.560" end="00:29:49.890" style="s2">sort of you know make connections right</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.830" end="00:29:52.050" style="s2">left and now it&#39;s just harder because</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.890" end="00:29:54.180" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.050" end="00:29:56.550" style="s2">seriously interested in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.180" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">cognitive science work that I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.550" end="00:30:03.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve badly got you know connected to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.800" end="00:30:08.310" style="s2">recently because it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.870" end="00:30:10.260" style="s2">obviously pertinent but and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.310" end="00:30:16.920" style="s2">other thing which you immediately</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.260" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">recognize is personally transformative I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.920" end="00:30:21.990" style="s2">just recently discovered Qi Gong and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:24.810" style="s2">bodywork um</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.990" end="00:30:27.900" style="s2">which you know it&#39;s just all how could I</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.810" end="00:30:30.060" style="s2">mean and it&#39;s obvious about it yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.900" end="00:30:31.470" style="s2">cuz the thing you would say is how could</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.060" end="00:30:35.820" style="s2">I have been so stupid</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.470" end="00:30:38.400" style="s2">well exactly I was so stupid</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.820" end="00:30:41.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve been telling myself and writing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.400" end="00:30:44.010" style="s2">about the necessity of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.210" end="00:30:46.890" style="s2">connections with the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.010" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">everything and in the last several</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:51.930" style="s2">months or whatever it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:59.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually been enacting it because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.930" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">did meditation for years and years you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.040" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">have to do a moment and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:09.330" style="s2">do I mean the first thing I realized was</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:18.780" style="s2">all right if you breathe all this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.330" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">actually transformative I was lucky</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.780" end="00:31:24.030" style="s2">because when I when I took up the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:27.930" style="s2">practice is way back in 91 so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.030" end="00:31:29.580" style="s2">what about 29 years ago I was lucky the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.930" end="00:31:31.790" style="s2">people that taught me taught me a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.580" end="00:31:34.260" style="s2">meditative practice for parce not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.790" end="00:31:40.200" style="s2">contemplative practice Mehta and Tai Chi</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:50.190" style="s2">a lesson I very very deeply learned that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.450" end="00:31:52.710" style="s2">you need all three of those well let me</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.190" end="00:31:55.380" style="s2">just put a footnote on that I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.710" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">been a carpenter and a gardener and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.380" end="00:31:59.540" style="s2">can build buildings and I can swing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:04.920" style="s2">hammer and I can do things with stone</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.540" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">but that was always true distinct you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.920" end="00:32:08.790" style="s2">know I could do I could do my</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:10.800" style="s2">intellectual work and then I could go</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.790" end="00:32:14.610" style="s2">out and build a building and they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.800" end="00:32:16.590" style="s2">too far apart and I and so I would</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.590" end="00:32:21.470" style="s2">connected to the earth you know I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:24.390" style="s2">yeah you know I&#39;m not just an academic</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.470" end="00:32:29.550" style="s2">which was true but I didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.390" end="00:32:33.330" style="s2">middle ground in this series I talked</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.550" end="00:32:35.610" style="s2">about the dour stuff and playing Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.330" end="00:32:38.420" style="s2">because you play it you don&#39;t do it mmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.610" end="00:32:41.940" style="s2">perfect URI I talked about serious play</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.420" end="00:32:48.690" style="s2">yeah I give touch each one as an example</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.940" end="00:32:51.050" style="s2">of enacted imaginal as soon as I started</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.690" end="00:32:53.790" style="s2">doing it and that&#39;s a long story but</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.050" end="00:32:55.420" style="s2">that was I thought oh well this is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.790" end="00:32:58.780" style="s2">is enacted around</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.420" end="00:33:02.560" style="s2">no because I&#39;ve always I had dream sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.780" end="00:33:04.780" style="s2">Oh since the 70s I had known you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.560" end="00:33:06.970" style="s2">job you really ought to dance more</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.780" end="00:33:11.050" style="s2">because I had a girl the girlfriend who</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.970" end="00:33:12.580" style="s2">was a dancer and I never did it and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.050" end="00:33:16.570" style="s2">there&#39;s still all sorts of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.580" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">reasons why not this is a and without</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.570" end="00:33:21.910" style="s2">something with just an analogue of dance</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:24.520" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t break its so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.910" end="00:33:28.750" style="s2">perfect it&#39;s interesting because I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.520" end="00:33:30.070" style="s2">one of those aha you know that is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:31.480" style="s2">an intellectual insight but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.070" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">existential insight and when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.480" end="00:33:36.100" style="s2">about those they often seem trivial yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">yeah the impact on me because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.100" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">doing so I was already in grad school</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.710" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">and everything and I was having success</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:46.480" style="s2">and in what you could call like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:48.400" style="s2">intellectual domain right and then it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">for reasons that have to do again with</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.400" end="00:33:52.780" style="s2">my idiosyncratic autobiography I&#39;d taken</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:55.780" style="s2">up these practices especially the Tai</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.780" end="00:33:56.500" style="s2">Chi and and I was practicing very</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.780" end="00:34:00.940" style="s2">religiously</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.500" end="00:34:02.500" style="s2">and yeah you know and other and I notice</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.940" end="00:34:05.260" style="s2">that I was picking up skills and I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.500" end="00:34:08.980" style="s2">thinking of sort of self-defense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.260" end="00:34:10.690" style="s2">yeah but my friends started coming to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.980" end="00:34:12.460" style="s2">and they started saying what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.690" end="00:34:15.300" style="s2">and I said what do you mean and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.460" end="00:34:19.900" style="s2">said you&#39;re arguing differently you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.300" end="00:34:22.810" style="s2">writing and I went oh and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.900" end="00:34:25.210" style="s2">got my first deep inkling of that level</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.810" end="00:34:27.220" style="s2">below the propositional and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.210" end="00:34:34.330" style="s2">level where the deep transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.220" end="00:34:36.400" style="s2">where the deep meaning making and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.330" end="00:34:40.300" style="s2">another here&#39;s another example at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.400" end="00:34:43.570" style="s2">I think of the disjunction that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.300" end="00:34:46.600" style="s2">was experiencing that is now getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.570" end="00:34:48.640" style="s2">smaller so so I had a kind of break a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.600" end="00:34:50.740" style="s2">few years ago and then I wrote some I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.640" end="00:34:53.650" style="s2">wrote a book of poems that got published</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.740" end="00:34:55.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s and then that&#39;s wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.650" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">I loved it and then they stopped coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.810" end="00:35:01.120" style="s2">and then I was back again to you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:03.220" style="s2">what do I do and because of when I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.120" end="00:35:05.860" style="s2">writing the poems I thought this is it I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.220" end="00:35:06.900" style="s2">mean this is what I should be doing but</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.860" end="00:35:09.240" style="s2">then they</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.900" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">you know it just became it became a rote</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.240" end="00:35:16.110" style="s2">performance and I had and I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:19.500" style="s2">a middle ground do you know yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.110" end="00:35:22.260" style="s2">because and it&#39;s a little too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.500" end="00:35:24.510" style="s2">but not maybe not I didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.260" end="00:35:27.480" style="s2">movement practice to connect the two</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.510" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">sides that&#39;s all and that I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.480" end="00:35:31.470" style="s2">there&#39;s deep aspects of about that again</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">and you can connect it to that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.470" end="00:35:36.030" style="s2">science because cerebellum right we used</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:37.320" style="s2">to think it was just about political</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.030" end="00:35:39.300" style="s2">balance but we&#39;re discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.320" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">cerebellum as connections to the frontal</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.300" end="00:35:45.270" style="s2">cortex and what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:49.290" style="s2">like the cerebellar cortex loop has a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.270" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">lot to do with your capacity to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.290" end="00:35:53.700" style="s2">so you yeah the cerebellum doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:54.630" style="s2">care about sort of contingencies right</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.700" end="00:35:56.370" style="s2">in the world that cares about</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.630" end="00:35:58.350" style="s2">contingencies within your brain and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.370" end="00:36:04.050" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t get that cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.350" end="00:36:08.810" style="s2">cortex loop running really well just</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.050" end="00:36:12.690" style="s2">never yeah yeah that&#39;s fantastic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.810" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">just fantastic yeah I I did I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.690" end="00:36:20.220" style="s2">couple of little lectures stealing from</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:24.630" style="s2">the entropic brain hypothesis and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.220" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">yeah I took yeah so the autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.630" end="00:36:30.870" style="s2">thing is that I happened across Michael</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.690" end="00:36:32.940" style="s2">Pollan&#39;s book which I think it was true</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.870" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">of a lot of people and it brought me</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.940" end="00:36:39.840" style="s2">right back to 1990 when when there when</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:44.460" style="s2">I was just about to either do oil and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.840" end="00:36:46.020" style="s2">macho Rama and there there serve craze I</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.460" end="00:36:47.670" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they&#39;re cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.020" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">science stuff and that was when I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.670" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">discovered Hillman and Korriban so I did</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:54.540" style="s2">sir</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:57.390" style="s2">so I had this really difficult decision</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.540" end="00:37:00.050" style="s2">to make whether to do the sort of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.390" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">ID garyun natural</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.050" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">you know much your honor and for reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:08.090" style="s2">cognitive science stuff which was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:11.900" style="s2">fascinating to me or to go over and do</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.090" end="00:37:14.330" style="s2">Helmand in Corbin so 25 years later POW</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.900" end="00:37:17.960" style="s2">and publishes his book and I&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.330" end="00:37:21.710" style="s2">back reading the embodied mind which I</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.960" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">had which I actually sold in 1992 just</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.710" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">to get it out of my office friends and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:35.570" style="s2">colleagues with Evan Thompson great and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:37.640" style="s2">so here&#39;s an interesting synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.570" end="00:37:38.750" style="s2">Evan was supposed to teach the course at</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.640" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">the University of Toronto called</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.750" end="00:37:41.960" style="s2">Buddhism and cognitive science he</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:43.970" style="s2">couldn&#39;t teach it and then he</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:46.220" style="s2">recommended me and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.970" end="00:37:51.980" style="s2">developed the original argument that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.220" end="00:38:02.630" style="s2">became my video series a week that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.980" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">really great promotional but I if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.630" end="00:38:06.680" style="s2">want it&#39;s not I was gonna say quick and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:09.260" style="s2">easy but it&#39;s like there&#39;s 50 videos and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.680" end="00:38:11.450" style="s2">they&#39;re an hour long but you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.260" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">somewhat fast access to those</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.450" end="00:38:23.450" style="s2">connections yeah somewhat fast is not 50</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:32.980" style="s2">hours well I think I think Jared had</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.450" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">said number 47 and 48 or something again</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.980" end="00:38:46.340" style="s2">references to early episode again I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to points you want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.340" end="00:38:51.830" style="s2">and say well what can I get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:54.080" style="s2">1990 and reconnect to that oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.830" end="00:38:55.070" style="s2">what&#39;s do stream there&#39;s parts in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.080" end="00:38:56.540" style="s2">series where I&#39;m actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.070" end="00:38:59.390" style="s2">where I actually do that argue for how</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.540" end="00:39:01.100" style="s2">to do that okay okay yeah cuz I do want</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.390" end="00:39:02.900" style="s2">to I do want to see that have you got</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.100" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">anything you&#39;ve got any manuscripts or</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.900" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">anything written about this stuff well I</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">do and I have bit some places</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:13.940" style="s2">right now turning the whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:15.170" style="s2">series into a book okay okay we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.940" end="00:39:18.350" style="s2">done okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.170" end="00:39:20.030" style="s2">this year sweet all right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.350" end="00:39:21.740" style="s2">another book coming out that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.030" end="00:39:23.090" style="s2">with Daniel Greg called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.740" end="00:39:25.130" style="s2">continuum from insight to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.090" end="00:39:29.620" style="s2">that tries to at least track out all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.130" end="00:39:29.620" style="s2">cognitive science from inside</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:34.820" style="s2">experiences oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.590" end="00:39:36.950" style="s2">trying to give it unified and integrated</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.820" end="00:39:38.630" style="s2">explanation for that and why they have</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.950" end="00:39:40.550" style="s2">such an impact on people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.630" end="00:39:42.230" style="s2">meaning and how that relates to because</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.550" end="00:39:44.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve kept these things all separate but</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.230" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">how that relates rationality insight and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.810" end="00:39:52.700" style="s2">wisdom together we&#39;ll see whether it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.700" end="00:39:57.830" style="s2">will flag your stuff for my current</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.250" end="00:40:01.600" style="s2">students I got about 12 of them and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.830" end="00:40:05.780" style="s2">we&#39;re doing a little online course on</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.600" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">court bands influence on on poets in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.780" end="00:40:13.160" style="s2">United States so we&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">transition from core bands idea of talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.160" end="00:40:24.860" style="s2">wheel to the uses made by Native it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">other bits of his cosmology by Robert by</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.860" end="00:40:30.710" style="s2">Charles Olson and Robert Duncan and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:35.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole flood of of poets who</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.710" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">were either explicitly or or well the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.570" end="00:40:43.010" style="s2">who are explicitly influenced by Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">so so the issues for us at the moment at</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.010" end="00:40:48.080" style="s2">least in that class are entirely</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">embodied because of Charles Olsen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.080" end="00:40:55.000" style="s2">emphasis on projective verse and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:57.620" style="s2">breath and his idea of proprioceptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.000" end="00:40:59.420" style="s2">cognition which is just what the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.620" end="00:41:02.750" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re talking about here and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.420" end="00:41:05.630" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to ground my</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.750" end="00:41:07.370" style="s2">students in you know immediately</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.630" end="00:41:11.870" style="s2">and the other the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.370" end="00:41:14.650" style="s2">that&#39;s crucial for me is that yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.870" end="00:41:18.020" style="s2">a teacher of biology I&#39;m an invertebrate</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.650" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">zoologist and the reason and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.020" end="00:41:24.890" style="s2">for that is that I looked at an insect</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:27.250" style="s2">once at the age at the age of 30 when I</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.890" end="00:41:29.690" style="s2">thought I was going to be a physicist I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.250" end="00:41:32.090" style="s2">discovered the Chris Amell and insects</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.690" end="00:41:33.860" style="s2">and and it just you know you&#39;d sound</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.090" end="00:41:39.050" style="s2">silly at the time like you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.860" end="00:41:41.990" style="s2">but that was a transformative moment sin</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.050" end="00:41:46.790" style="s2">and so one of the one of the reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:50.030" style="s2">do poetry and to and to do art and dance</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.790" end="00:41:52.010" style="s2">and movement is quite simply to animate</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.030" end="00:41:53.840" style="s2">the world I mean not it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.010" end="00:41:56.990" style="s2">coming from you it&#39;s the it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.840" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">the dialogue and I thought yes is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.990" end="00:42:02.870" style="s2">interesting you&#39;re talking in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:04.340" style="s2">meaning and and because you know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.870" end="00:42:06.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking about that while you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.340" end="00:42:11.750" style="s2">were talking that whole time I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.620" end="00:42:13.960" style="s2">care about meaning because it&#39;s me in</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.750" end="00:42:16.760" style="s2">the sense that it&#39;s not it&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.960" end="00:42:19.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like I said to the young&#39;uns once</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.760" end="00:42:21.590" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t care about God and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.190" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like that at all because I</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.590" end="00:42:26.660" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t care about God at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:28.460" style="s2">because I&#39;m much more I mean he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.660" end="00:42:30.490" style="s2">interesting I mean the angels are</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.460" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">interesting but God is totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.490" end="00:42:35.060" style="s2">uninteresting and so&#39;s meaning I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:38.810" style="s2">who gives a about meaning I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.060" end="00:42:41.390" style="s2">look at insects and plants and and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.810" end="00:42:43.460" style="s2">other people and the meaning is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.390" end="00:42:45.740" style="s2">that&#39;sthat&#39;s like you said that&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.460" end="00:42:47.210" style="s2">forget how you what your terminology is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.740" end="00:42:49.010" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.210" end="00:42:51.620" style="s2">propositional issue and I don&#39;t give a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.010" end="00:43:09.380" style="s2">damn about propositional issues I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.620" end="00:43:16.280" style="s2">to get the balls of reality you know no</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.380" end="00:43:18.410" style="s2">no no no no because</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.280" end="00:43:20.270" style="s2">because that&#39;s the other thing that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.410" end="00:43:22.310" style="s2">that that&#39;s the other thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.270" end="00:43:26.390" style="s2">really curious about and and you would</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.310" end="00:43:29.180" style="s2">know something about this is that ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.390" end="00:43:41.750" style="s2">that look abstract actually change your</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.180" end="00:43:43.010" style="s2">perceptions they can say when I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.750" end="00:43:46.250" style="s2">the word meaning as I said I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.010" end="00:43:48.080" style="s2">IIIi put it as a metaphor for we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.250" end="00:43:50.030" style="s2">using something about language that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.080" end="00:43:52.190" style="s2">in some way analogous to the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.030" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">connectedness which we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.190" end="00:44:02.210" style="s2">when you want to give so I&#39;m pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:03.830" style="s2">that no no I understand yeah so the guy</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.210" end="00:44:05.810" style="s2">I wanted to talk about is Michael</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.830" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">Anderson and he&#39;s got a book called</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.810" end="00:44:08.810" style="s2">after phrenology and a bunch of papers</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:10.520" style="s2">on what he calls the massive</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.810" end="00:44:12.920" style="s2">redeployment hypothesis is I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.520" end="00:44:14.540" style="s2">didn&#39;t give me a second on this and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.920" end="00:44:16.070" style="s2">idea is we used to think you know this</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.540" end="00:44:17.660" style="s2">function is located here in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.070" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">and Borla and that&#39;s what he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.660" end="00:44:23.230" style="s2">after phrenology we&#39;re now getting the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:25.550" style="s2">same area the brain gets actually used</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.230" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">you know biologists you know something</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.550" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">about like exaptation right about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:35.000" style="s2">one function can be done so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:38.060" style="s2">the brain does something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.000" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">analogous to that it&#39;s written trolling</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.060" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">right handedness and can use that for</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:49.880" style="s2">manipulating sound in speech right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:52.430" style="s2">and so I I think in a lot of ways what</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.880" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">you can see is you can see stuff being</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.430" end="00:44:58.730" style="s2">exacted upwards out of the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:00.770" style="s2">and then and and we can get and that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:03.500" style="s2">there&#39;s also feedback back down right</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.770" end="00:45:07.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.500" end="00:45:10.250" style="s2">top-down thing at the same time actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.870" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">John Kenney and I published work on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.250" end="00:45:15.170" style="s2">a long time ago in the nineties we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:16.520" style="s2">talking about Lake often Johnston&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.170" end="00:45:19.550" style="s2">or now yeah buddy</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.520" end="00:45:21.770" style="s2">metaphor yeah we we didn&#39;t we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.550" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">arguing against the phenomena of pervade</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.770" end="00:45:25.820" style="s2">the pervasiveness of of metaphor but we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:29.510" style="s2">thought that their model was a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.820" end="00:45:32.090" style="s2">too simplistic to borrow not enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:37.640" style="s2">I think Michael Anderson&#39;s work point so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.090" end="00:45:39.619" style="s2">yes stuff does come up okay yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.640" end="00:45:42.590" style="s2">like to take a look at that because</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.619" end="00:45:45.410" style="s2">because people you know ever since I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.590" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">I don&#39;t know pretty pretty young people</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.410" end="00:45:48.619" style="s2">would say but this isn&#39;t interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:52.030" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s all just</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.619" end="00:45:58.520" style="s2">abstract and then then I would always</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.030" end="00:46:07.850" style="s2">excuse me no no it&#39;s not abstract it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.520" end="00:46:09.050" style="s2">changes your life there&#39;s two ways in</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.850" end="00:46:11.660" style="s2">which people are dismissive when they do</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.050" end="00:46:14.300" style="s2">that right but it&#39;s not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.660" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">I mean this name might not be important</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.300" end="00:46:17.780" style="s2">to you but within cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.310" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">the work on reasoning and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.780" end="00:46:21.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s Kahneman and Tversky</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:23.330" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.320" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">idea of sort of a swan process okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.330" end="00:46:28.730" style="s2">Barbara Tversky has a new book out</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:31.310" style="s2">called mind the emotion mm-hmm how a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.730" end="00:46:33.740" style="s2">of our abstract normal logic abilities I</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.310" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">would say are exhausted out of our</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.060" end="00:46:52.520" style="s2">and I have two hard things for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">students and saying by the way now the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.520" end="00:46:58.100" style="s2">scientists are actually giving this data</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.950" end="00:47:04.280" style="s2">to produce things people which is saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.100" end="00:47:06.710" style="s2">before yeah that&#39;s pretty yeah nearly</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.280" end="00:47:09.260" style="s2">has been exacted out of physical balance</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.710" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s concerning to justice like in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.260" end="00:47:13.670" style="s2">all kinds of more abstract things but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why but I think for example a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.670" end="00:47:18.320" style="s2">clear example of the imaginal is our</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:20.690" style="s2">relationship to justice we can only you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.320" end="00:47:23.720" style="s2">have to we have to activate all of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.690" end="00:47:25.970" style="s2">balanced machinery through the through</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.720" end="00:47:28.220" style="s2">these image the imaginal symbols in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.970" end="00:47:30.170" style="s2">order to talk about right there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.220" end="00:47:33.220" style="s2">artifact ideal of justice I think as</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.170" end="00:47:38.540" style="s2">Coromant says without that intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.220" end="00:47:40.609" style="s2">mm we co activate what we need the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.540" end="00:47:42.680" style="s2">balanced machinery and get it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.609" end="00:47:44.750" style="s2">talking to that you know the</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.900" end="00:50:13.560" style="s2">has to relate to teaching and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.630" end="00:50:16.080" style="s2">relate to you know a reanimation of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.560" end="00:50:19.050" style="s2">world for people at this at this primary</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.080" end="00:50:23.910" style="s2">level so I&#39;m thinking poetry and theater</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.050" end="00:50:26.370" style="s2">and dance and bodywork but I love I love</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.910" end="00:50:28.830" style="s2">to be a bending I&#39;m a scientist by</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.370" end="00:50:33.780" style="s2">training so I love to be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.830" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">in the neuroscience you know because</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.780" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">because that&#39;s tremendously because that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:42.930" style="s2">allows like I&#39;m going down to Brunswick</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:46.200" style="s2">Maine and one of the to do a thing for</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.930" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">the Brunswick unions on Saturday and one</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.200" end="00:50:51.120" style="s2">of the primary guys there is an engineer</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">and so you always have you always have</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.120" end="00:50:58.920" style="s2">the engineer in the audience who sitting</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">there and and is incredibly schizoid</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.920" end="00:51:04.680" style="s2">about his day job which is engineering</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:07.320" style="s2">and then he&#39;s had his union break down</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.680" end="00:51:09.180" style="s2">and he&#39;s got all these imagination</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.320" end="00:51:11.130" style="s2">things in there and he don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.180" end="00:51:15.170" style="s2">deal with it and if you can show a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.130" end="00:51:22.320" style="s2">picture of the cerebellum flyering</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.170" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">then you can suck them into so this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.320" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">really good I&#39;m in conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:32.490" style="s2">lot of people for example I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:34.470" style="s2">conversation with Rafe Kelly and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:37.170" style="s2">putting together like he&#39;s been put in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.470" end="00:51:39.810" style="s2">community of practices so what he does</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.170" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">is he he&#39;s created in ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.810" end="00:51:43.290" style="s2">I&#39;m some videos out there mhmmm where</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:46.980" style="s2">he&#39;s basically teaching people how to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.290" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">parkour in nature mmm sort of martial</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.980" end="00:51:51.930" style="s2">art stuff so mindfulness practice and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:51:54.780" style="s2">also sitting around a campfire and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.930" end="00:51:56.850" style="s2">circling doing a circling practice and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.780" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">integrating me all together and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.850" end="00:51:59.670" style="s2">been and he and I have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:02.220" style="s2">because he&#39;s he&#39;s using some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.670" end="00:52:03.960" style="s2">ideas from cognitive science that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.220" end="00:52:05.670" style="s2">been presenting and he&#39;s using that to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.960" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">try and sharpen and develop and refine</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.670" end="00:52:09.000" style="s2">this ecology of practices and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.000" end="00:52:12.510" style="s2">it&#39;s supporting and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:16.130" style="s2">dialogue is it&#39;s not just what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.510" end="00:52:16.130" style="s2">saying Tom it&#39;s not just abstract theory</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.050" end="00:52:23.850" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely what I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.120" end="00:52:26.220" style="s2">doing and I and I&#39;m not I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.850" end="00:52:28.620" style="s2">them I don&#39;t have the psyche or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.220" end="00:52:30.900" style="s2">resources to do it out of myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.620" end="00:52:33.510" style="s2">I gotta participate with people who have</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.900" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">different backgrounds because I write my</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.510" end="00:52:40.950" style="s2">default mode is to think and the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">I can do but I don&#39;t do them naturally</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.950" end="00:52:48.360" style="s2">in groups because I&#39;m dude I&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:51.300" style="s2">defensive you know and and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.360" end="00:52:53.340" style="s2">recognized that and I&#39;m so so boy can</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.300" end="00:52:55.980" style="s2">you point me to something that I could</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.340" end="00:52:58.230" style="s2">read about what he and or you ordering</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.980" end="00:52:59.970" style="s2">as rape has written anything he&#39;s done a</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.230" end="00:53:02.550" style="s2">couple of videos where he and I are</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.970" end="00:53:04.860" style="s2">talking about these connections I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.550" end="00:53:06.120" style="s2">there&#39;s three or four in total I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.860" end="00:53:07.350" style="s2">know if Jared&#39;s familiar with them but</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.120" end="00:53:10.650" style="s2">they&#39;re out there they&#39;re on my channel</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.350" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">okay man alright I don&#39;t find him you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.650" end="00:53:15.120" style="s2">see that in practice what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:18.420" style="s2">and there&#39;s also videos I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.120" end="00:53:20.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve a link to where he&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.420" end="00:53:22.830" style="s2">the literally in the field in a field</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.630" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">students about how to take these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.830" end="00:53:28.530" style="s2">right and how they how they are mediated</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:30.660" style="s2">into and then how they are enriched by</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.530" end="00:53:32.550" style="s2">these embodied practices and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.660" end="00:53:34.680" style="s2">engagement and it&#39;s all about I once</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.550" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">said to him I said what you&#39;re doing all</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.680" end="00:53:37.380" style="s2">these practices and maybe this aligns</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:39.210" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying Tom if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.380" end="00:53:43.410" style="s2">trying to get people to fall in love</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.210" end="00:53:45.600" style="s2">with yeah yeah yeah I mean I used to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.410" end="00:53:47.130" style="s2">that in the context of biology courses</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.600" end="00:53:49.140" style="s2">you know you go out and you collect</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.130" end="00:53:51.480" style="s2">insects you look at the flowers you</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.140" end="00:53:54.890" style="s2">learn the trees you learn the stars you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.480" end="00:53:57.900" style="s2">know I mean but we call that science</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.890" end="00:54:01.020" style="s2">when and when in fact that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.900" end="00:54:02.520" style="s2">what was going on yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.020" end="00:54:05.210" style="s2">falling in love with the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.520" end="00:54:08.690" style="s2">precisely and and and I want to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.210" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">ways that don&#39;t look like bio I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.690" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:15.930" style="s2">because I I do I could do I can do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.180" style="s2">you know I&#39;m you know I have a handful</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.930" end="00:54:20.950" style="s2">of students who became entomologists</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.180" end="00:54:25.630" style="s2">because I dragged them out with another</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.950" end="00:54:32.170" style="s2">you know that&#39;s it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.630" end="00:54:33.430" style="s2">poetry is humanities lab and yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.170" end="00:54:35.050" style="s2">know I was just talking to a guy the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.430" end="00:54:37.360" style="s2">other day said oh that&#39;s a poetry is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.050" end="00:54:41.110" style="s2">it&#39;s humanities lab but he tees a decent</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.360" end="00:54:43.860" style="s2">English teacher and and and and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.110" end="00:54:46.180" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that is perfect that really</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.860" end="00:54:53.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what I that&#39;s what I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.180" end="00:54:57.340" style="s2">in doing both your work is just how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.950" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">it integrates and connects like all</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.340" end="00:55:00.730" style="s2">these different domains I mean both of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">you having scientific backgrounds but</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.730" end="00:55:05.560" style="s2">also these deeply philosophical and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:07.540" style="s2">spiritual backgrounds and you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.560" end="00:55:10.540" style="s2">draw and combine all these different</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.540" end="00:55:15.210" style="s2">things it&#39;s so it&#39;s so nice to see that</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.540" end="00:55:21.790" style="s2">there&#39;s people who are transdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.210" end="00:55:23.830" style="s2">because yeah yeah it is really sweet I</p>
