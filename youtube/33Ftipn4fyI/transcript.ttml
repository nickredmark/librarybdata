<p begin="00:00:04.300" end="00:00:11.889" style="s2">sociopathy sure so the more common term</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.370" end="00:00:13.770" style="s2">is a sociopath so sociopathy is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.889" end="00:00:17.500" style="s2">condition of being a sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.770" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2">sociopaths are individuals that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.500" end="00:00:24.880" style="s2">very low capacity for empathy they do</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.800" end="00:00:28.690" style="s2">not display normal love they do not</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.880" end="00:00:31.900" style="s2">appear to experience remorse they may</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.690" end="00:00:34.059" style="s2">experience regret you know person if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.900" end="00:00:35.469" style="s2">back your car into something you will</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.059" end="00:00:37.000" style="s2">feel regret whether you&#39;re a sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.469" end="00:00:39.370" style="s2">or not because you have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.000" end="00:00:43.300" style="s2">aftermath but you know if you run over</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.370" end="00:00:45.010" style="s2">somebody&#39;s pet if you&#39;re normal you will</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.300" end="00:00:46.840" style="s2">feel terrible at the pain you&#39;ve caused</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.010" end="00:00:50.170" style="s2">and if you&#39;re a sociopath you may feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.840" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">very little beyond annoyance do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.170" end="00:00:55.510" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a disorder no I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">it makes very little sense to think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.510" end="00:01:01.210" style="s2">it as a disorder and I&#39;ll tell you why I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:05.649" style="s2">mean the first thing is the commonality</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.210" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">of it so it seems to be that somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.649" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">between 1 and 4 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:15.609" style="s2">population is sociopathic that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:16.869" style="s2">high a high number for a disorder and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.609" end="00:01:19.060" style="s2">could be that you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.869" end="00:01:21.549" style="s2">you know lead in the water could cause 1</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.060" end="00:01:22.959" style="s2">to 4 percent of the population to be you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.549" end="00:01:23.799" style="s2">know mentally retarded in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.959" end="00:01:26.380" style="s2">recognizable</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.799" end="00:01:28.569" style="s2">way but you wouldn&#39;t find it broadly</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.380" end="00:01:29.170" style="s2">distributed across an entire culture in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.569" end="00:01:32.619" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.170" end="00:01:36.369" style="s2">it&#39;s also true that we see sociopaths in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.619" end="00:01:38.409" style="s2">many regards rising to the top of of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.369" end="00:01:40.810" style="s2">economic hierarchies and political</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.409" end="00:01:43.060" style="s2">hierarchies so it&#39;s conspicuous that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.810" end="00:01:45.249" style="s2">something that we have wanted to label</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.060" end="00:01:47.049" style="s2">as a disorder seems to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.249" end="00:01:50.409" style="s2">superpower for a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.049" end="00:01:53.529" style="s2">people so disorder is probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.409" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">right category I also think we draw two</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.529" end="00:02:00.700" style="s2">starkly the line between sociopaths and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:04.389" style="s2">the rest of us I think essentially all</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.700" end="00:02:07.779" style="s2">of us are sociopathic in some regards</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.389" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">with respect to some things and probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.779" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">we have to be this way so we will all</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">recognize that we can hear about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">suffering of a population that is remote</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">from us either in space or in time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">we can feel very little even if in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">abstract what is happening to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">population is frightening or abhorrent</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">to us we may be able to hear about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">and then gone about our day you know go</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">buy a coffee or whatever where we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">you know we could have had our lives</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">pivot around the discovery that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:42.570" style="s2">were people suffering and yet it only</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">captures our attention momentarily so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.570" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">that strikes me as the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">being sociopathic largely because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:55.050" style="s2">population that we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">too far for us to do anything productive</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.050" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">and so it wouldn&#39;t make sense for us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">feel the emotion deeply because it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">be disruptive of things that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">do have influence over I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:13.560" style="s2">also really important to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">the the lesson I would say of something</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.560" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">like an organized-crime leader an</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">organized-crime leader if the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">we have about these folks is right may</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">very well love their family passionately</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">and they may go very far out of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">way to provide benefits and to protect</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:36.770" style="s2">their families from harm and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">time they may be able to turn off their</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.770" end="00:03:43.050" style="s2">feelings of sympathy or empathy with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2">people that they have to harm in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.050" end="00:03:47.239" style="s2">to engage in the criminal activity that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">they engage in and so when we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.239" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">somebody who is in a position of control</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:57.330" style="s2">and an organized crime Network give an</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">order that does harm to innocent people</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.330" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">we think this must be a sociopath but</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t square with the definition</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:09.670" style="s2">of sociopaths and with somebody who goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:11.560" style="s2">home to to their family and as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.670" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">sevillio a relationship with them I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.560" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">think this is a much richer landscape</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">than we give it credit for and we should</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:22.780" style="s2">think very carefully about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">people have a sociopathic capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.780" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">order to function normally so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:29.139" style="s2">to be overwhelmed by the huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:31.570" style="s2">suffering in the world and so is not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.139" end="00:04:33.700" style="s2">be too focused on events or</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.570" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">circumstances too far or too powerful to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.700" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">do anything about and that when we when</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">we refer to sociopaths we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.650" style="s2">talking about people who are obligate</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">who have no choice and no capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.650" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">tap into the suffering of others when</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">need be and that that is a special case</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:53.350" style="s2">but there&#39;s no reason to think that just</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:57.070" style="s2">because it&#39;s at the far end of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.350" end="00:04:59.410" style="s2">continuum of you know how how tapped</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:01.570" style="s2">into other people&#39;s emotional states an</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:03.130" style="s2">individual is that it is suddenly a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.570" end="00:05:05.380" style="s2">disorder once you get to the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.130" end="00:05:08.169" style="s2">continuum I would imagine in ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.380" end="00:05:13.419" style="s2">circumstances that there are cases in</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.169" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">which effectively one might be of value</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.419" end="00:05:20.890" style="s2">to one&#39;s lineage in a form that was that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be disrupted by by observing</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.890" end="00:05:25.960" style="s2">suffering soldiers on a battlefield for</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">example might be very effective if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.960" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">could tune out the immense amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">suffering around them and do their job</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:37.450" style="s2">in a more or less mechanical fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">I do wonder if the truth of sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.450" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">is that in ancestral circumstances they</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:45.970" style="s2">would have been pointed outward so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.210" end="00:05:48.130" style="s2">their sociopathic tendencies would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.970" end="00:05:49.780" style="s2">been a benefit to their lineage because</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.130" end="00:05:52.870" style="s2">of what they could do to competing</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.780" end="00:05:54.940" style="s2">groups and that what we are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.870" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">reason we think of this as a disorder is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.940" end="00:06:02.169" style="s2">that people&#39;s sociopathic powers are</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:04.180" style="s2">turned chaotically and some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:06.490" style="s2">turned you know in close quarters</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.180" end="00:06:07.500" style="s2">against people who are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.490" end="00:06:10.380" style="s2">in-group and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.500" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">or are not supposed to be the target of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.380" end="00:06:15.540" style="s2">this of this pattern but that it really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:17.970" style="s2">is an adaptation just deployed in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.540" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make any sense you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.970" end="00:06:23.100" style="s2">these words sympathy and empathy what do</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">you mean by well in this case I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.100" end="00:06:28.470" style="s2">them somewhat interchangeably because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">requires some careful thought to see why</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">there they should be defined in the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:39.270" style="s2">they should be defined but in a formal</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:43.650" style="s2">sense sympathy is empathy with an extra</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.270" end="00:06:50.220" style="s2">characteristic empathy is in my language</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.650" end="00:06:52.590" style="s2">it is the capacity to feel the emotions</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.220" end="00:06:54.270" style="s2">of another by taking the data of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.590" end="00:06:57.090" style="s2">circumstances and running it through</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.270" end="00:07:00.600" style="s2">one&#39;s own mental architecture as if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.090" end="00:07:02.640" style="s2">were their sympathy you do the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.600" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">thing with the acknowledgement that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.640" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">are effectively on the same team as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:11.070" style="s2">entity the person or the creature with</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">whom you are sympathizing so the example</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.070" end="00:07:15.540" style="s2">that I think makes this clear is we</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">get sociopathy wrong we imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">they are incapable of empathy because</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:09:02.870" style="s2">there are certain places where they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:05.640" style="s2">a bit tone-deaf there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.870" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">experiences in being a human being that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.640" end="00:09:11.160" style="s2">are not usually described very well and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:14.700" style="s2">so a sociopath may have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.160" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">picking up what it really would be like</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.700" end="00:09:21.690" style="s2">to have that emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:23.550" style="s2">so things surrounding love and grief and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.690" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">things like that may be a bit hard for</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.550" end="00:09:27.090" style="s2">them to put their fingers on but in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">general they may be very attuned to what</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.090" end="00:09:30.540" style="s2">somebody&#39;s psychological state is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:32.670" style="s2">because somebody else&#39;s psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.540" end="00:09:34.770" style="s2">state may constitute an opportunity or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2">hazard to them and being aware of it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.770" end="00:09:40.680" style="s2">is useful even just mechanically so</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.860" end="00:09:43.230" style="s2">their empathy only extends to the point</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.680" end="00:09:45.370" style="s2">where usefulness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.230" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">well actually I would say it a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.370" end="00:09:52.740" style="s2">differently I would say the empathy that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:56.350" style="s2">I see sociopaths being best at is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.740" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">learning the lessons of emotional states</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.350" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">that are visible and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">an emotional state is difficult to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">into I mean think of how confusing</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.210" end="00:10:13.450" style="s2">profound grief is profound grief is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.690" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">the most remarkably complex state where</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.450" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">you know at one moment you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:24.580" style="s2">completely lost in despair and then 10</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:27.280" style="s2">minutes later you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.580" end="00:10:29.830" style="s2">productive and you you&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.280" end="00:10:33.270" style="s2">about the loss and so that oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.830" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">has to be bewildering if you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.270" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">experienced because it seems like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">know being productive it puts the lie to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:44.380" style="s2">the fact that you were debilitated only</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">moments ago and you know only if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:49.720" style="s2">experienced that and you know how real</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:54.250" style="s2">it is to oscillate between being focused</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.720" end="00:10:56.050" style="s2">on this terrible loss and being in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.250" end="00:10:57.490" style="s2">another mindset doing something else and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.050" end="00:10:58.960" style="s2">not thinking about it only if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.490" end="00:11:01.030" style="s2">done that do you realize that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.960" end="00:11:03.520" style="s2">transition is even possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.030" end="00:11:06.220" style="s2">let alone the common experience of grief</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.520" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">so you know when a sociopath sees this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:12.220" style="s2">not having felt the despair at the loss</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:15.280" style="s2">of somebody that they loved I think they</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.220" end="00:11:16.870" style="s2">think we&#39;re playing or something or that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.280" end="00:11:19.330" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the evidence that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.870" end="00:11:22.150" style="s2">really as despairing as we appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.330" end="00:11:23.830" style="s2">in that phase or something so anyway it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.150" end="00:11:27.190" style="s2">can be can be very revealing when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.830" end="00:11:30.130" style="s2">get to those few places in life where</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.190" end="00:11:32.500" style="s2">it&#39;s rare to see a really good</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.130" end="00:11:34.090" style="s2">description of the experience those are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.500" end="00:11:37.900" style="s2">places that a sociopath would have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.090" end="00:11:40.300" style="s2">very difficult time simulating the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.900" end="00:11:41.110" style="s2">experience because nothing has described</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:44.490" style="s2">what it&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.110" end="00:11:48.460" style="s2">I suspect we can do a brilliant job with</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.490" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">sociopathy but that we can&#39;t deploy the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.460" end="00:11:52.960" style="s2">solution on a population that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:55.060" style="s2">gone through development and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.960" end="00:11:59.080" style="s2">to be very effective with it that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.060" end="00:12:01.990" style="s2">we would need to do is understand what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.080" end="00:12:03.940" style="s2">the frame of mind of somebody is as they</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.990" end="00:12:09.220" style="s2">switch between their sociopathic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.940" end="00:12:13.090" style="s2">their empathic mode and then train that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.220" end="00:12:17.170" style="s2">switch so that it is tuned to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.090" end="00:12:18.910" style="s2">realities of of life and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.170" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">with respect to the obligate sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.910" end="00:12:28.120" style="s2">that ideally a civilization that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:31.630" style="s2">functions should provide no profit to an</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.120" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">individual for externalizing harm onto</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.630" end="00:12:36.550" style="s2">other people and if you actually took</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:38.740" style="s2">that seriously such that there was no</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.550" end="00:12:43.560" style="s2">opportunity to get ahead by hurting</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.740" end="00:12:45.550" style="s2">people then a sociopath would not find</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.560" end="00:12:49.590" style="s2">opportunities of the rest of us find</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.550" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">troubling they would be corralled into</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.590" end="00:12:55.480" style="s2">behaviors that were at least not harmful</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:12:57.430" style="s2">and so they might be harder to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.480" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">because their motivations for doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.430" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">something might be different from what</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:04.150" style="s2">another person might be motivated by but</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:06.340" style="s2">the behavior that resulted might be very</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.150" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">similar because there would be no profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.340" end="00:13:11.800" style="s2">in harming people and walking away</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">without feeling bad about building</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.800" end="00:13:18.130" style="s2">systems that don&#39;t reward that behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:21.940" style="s2">ought to be a focus at every at every</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.130" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">scale the price that we pay at every</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:30.820" style="s2">other is very very high and frankly if</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:39.850" style="s2">10-12 generations down the road in order</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.180" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">to protect them adequately from us our</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.850" end="00:14:44.680" style="s2">tools are such that we can wreak</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.680" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">so the degree to which this needs to be</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.529" end="00:14:58.230" style="s2">that&#39;s where we are and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.449" end="00:15:01.690" style="s2">we have to alter the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.230" end="00:15:03.790" style="s2">landscape not only to be healthy but to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:04.860" style="s2">be modified for the new realities that</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.860" end="00:15:12.600" style="s2">being as has handed us people who have</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.600" end="00:15:17.310" style="s2">others are obviously a special hazard</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.490" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">and we need to watch out for it but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.310" end="00:15:21.930" style="s2">know I think the story of human</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:24.390" style="s2">variation is a rich and sometimes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.930" end="00:15:28.410" style="s2">difficult story and that the desire to</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.410" end="00:15:34.790" style="s2">know people who have other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.210" end="00:15:37.050" style="s2">neurological diversity is a mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.790" end="00:15:41.480" style="s2">so anyway I would be I&#39;d be hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.050" end="00:15:44.400" style="s2">say that we should do anything extreme</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.480" end="00:15:47.400" style="s2">with respect to people on a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.400" end="00:15:49.650" style="s2">but we do want to rule out the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.400" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">in which people get ahead by producing</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.480" end="00:15:57.470" style="s2">learning what developmental experiences</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.470" end="00:16:00.630" style="s2">probably something we should know and as</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.550" end="00:16:02.790" style="s2">soon as we know what makes people</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.630" end="00:16:04.860" style="s2">compassionate I would love to see it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.790" end="00:16:07.100" style="s2">induced in more people at a greater</p>
