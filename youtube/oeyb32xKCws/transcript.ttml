<p begin="00:00:09.440" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually public there might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">people joining so</p>

<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:17.680" style="s2">just want to introduce myself in case</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:18.400" style="s2">you came here through the ntmlm</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.680" end="00:00:20.720" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.400" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">because this is not an anti-mlm channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.720" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">i am anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">but this channel is dedicated to my</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">journey towards</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:28.960" style="s2">creating a world that works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:32.000" style="s2">and my own personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.960" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">and learning as it all unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">and so part of that journey is that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">few months ago i fell down an anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:40.160" style="s2">rabbit hole when one of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">joined nmlm</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.160" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">and i&#39;ve always kind of been interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">in the exponential math and so i have</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">joined a lot of the nt as a subscriber a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">lot of the anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.440" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">channels started with key keys i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:52.480" style="s2">the first one i got closely followed by</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.480" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">and then it just snowballed from there</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">i seem to join the ntmlm community right</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">all of this drama took place or a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">months before the drama took place i</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know when the ntl</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">mlm community started but it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s exploding not in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">drama way because everything goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">through drama but in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">a so many channels and then people see</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">that are like oh i could create this</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">content and creating more and more of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">but i wanted to give um my</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">take on the anti-mlm drama and community</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">um just because i want it as part of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.680" end="00:01:32.079" style="s2">and i do have some opinions on on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">is what is going down</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">as well as uh but i do</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not just anti-mlm i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">anti-capitalism i&#39;m anti</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">this entire pyramid ponzi scheme</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">structure that we&#39;re all in right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">and i think part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">is why i offer a different voice that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.680" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">going to be more controversial because</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">most people</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">can see why they&#39;re anti-mlm but are</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">pro-capitalistic or like</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">and i want a business in the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">structure i&#39;m not anti-business owner</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">i&#39;m not anti-working within the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:05.920" style="s2">i&#39;m just a lot of the same critiques we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">have about the mlm system can be had</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.920" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">about the capitalist system now falling</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">down this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">anti-mlm rabbit hole i ended up creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">an mlm it&#39;s called meta learning magic</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">which the acronym is mlm</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">on purpose and it wasn&#39;t going to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">the same structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t it is an omni when</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">everyone wins</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">structure and yet it honors that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">people in the beginning are taking more</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">and creating the product and creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">the community and will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">hopefully retire</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">a year so this no one&#39;s gonna become</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s chemicalistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">in a uh influencer culture in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">content creators and why this drama has</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">so a quick rundown sorry i&#39;m like i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">forget to log into this and haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">gotten to the t</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">so there is a anti-mlm youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">personality called kimberlea or she was</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">anti-youtube when i found her i found</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">her through the anti-mlm world i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">know her from beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">and i never jived with her content i i</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">liked the intellectualism of it like i</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">liked</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">i thought she was very smart and well</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">articulated and so i enjoyed some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">um individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">shows those are called videos but not</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">the um not her overall personality</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">because i found her very capitalistic i</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">found her very</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">toxically positive which triggered all</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">of my stuff about my sister and all my</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">stuff about capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">and so although i can watch something</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">and be triggered by it and get what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">meant to get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">i always found her and it made sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">when she came out as</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">auntie auntie mlm i don&#39;t know she came</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">out as not being anti-mlm and the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">that she did it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">i understand um but it&#39;s it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">is the reason anyway so sorry so she</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">came out did a two-hour live</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">um explaining why she wasn&#39;t auntie emma</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">and basically it was because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">anti-ammo community is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">is bullies and toxic and whatever she</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">which then she was critiqued because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">was two hours like it was a live you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily edit lives that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">i do lives because i don&#39;t edit video</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">designing the way to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">without me being known for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">which is great because that is my little</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">introvert self would love that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">but i also have to be open to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">that i might be known and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">if there needs to be a let&#39;s see where</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">this came from my brain won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">tell you i won&#39;t be able to tell you 10</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">years from now</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">what this 10-year journey looked like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to showcase it some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s unlisted some of it&#39;s private and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">some of it is absolutely public</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">and i try to do as much public as</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">possible the more it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">getting less professionalism as i go on</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">less thumbnails because now</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve managed i joined social media</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">thinking because it was the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">influence in order to get people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">order to create a world that worked for</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">and now i see that it is the exact</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">opposite of how i will be doing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">but um anyway so kimberly i did two hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">a video</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">basically crapping on the ntlm community</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">but also speaking her truth that she</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">basically was here for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">for the views here because the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">helped her grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">and she&#39;s not passionate about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">anymore and the very thing she wants to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to do which is reaction</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">videos of her watching content of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">in mlms same things and their training</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">videos and then reacting to them which</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">is where oh it is the stuff we end up</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">but then all because there&#39;s so many of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">these creators out there we end up we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">end up watching</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">the same clip in an mlm</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">be commented on by multiple people which</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">does get boring</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">and old and so the anti-mlm community</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">is saturated we&#39;re about like that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">actually what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve created our own little mlm where</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can be successful too no</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">no you can&#39;t be there aren&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">viewers there aren&#39;t enough people care</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">about anti-mlm content</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">for everybody to have a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">viewers because we can&#39;t watch all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">your content it just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">and so anyway so kimberly i did a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">two-hour live video like i said she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">not my personality i don&#39;t like her but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">she also</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">copyright straw striked um</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">and starts with the t either she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">one of the people i only just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">found her through the ante malem drama</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">um and it would copyright wrote strike</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">i have my favorite anti-mlm people a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">handful of people of whom</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">i found kiki&#39;s channel and i love kiki i</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what her actual name is i</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">tried to remember before this video and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">i was like whatever she calls herself</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">kiki</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">on if that&#39;s what her tag is known as</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m gonna call her</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">um that i love her personality</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m not there for anything but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">anti-mlm stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">or the scam stuff so so that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">thing is the anti-mlm people came</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">through and to anti-alim generally for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">being in an mlm the ones that are true</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">and real</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">and so they generally have a niche that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">goes alongside the anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">so like deanna got involved in beachbody</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">she also has a vibe of like be caring</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">about nutrition and caring about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">type of stuff strangely enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">um there&#39;s people who come to it through</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">more of like the monet side and more of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">the beauty side and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">like kiki i don&#39;t think ever joined mlm</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">but that side of it then they end up</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">going on to creating like</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">um makeup tutorials or shopping</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">tutorials just like kiki does not</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">tutorials</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">how to shop but like unboxings and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">we do not need a how to shop</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">capitalism nobody doesn&#39;t need that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">i&#39;m not i don&#39;t really like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">unboxings they&#39;re not my thing because</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">i&#39;m anti-capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">and yet i love her um deanna i like love</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">her personality</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">and gel i think how she says her name</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">i&#39;m really bad at pronouncing things</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">but she says it constantly enough that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">think i have that right</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">um i love her personality and i&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">watch her put on makeup</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s how much i like her her</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">personality comes through</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">i really like madison from i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">remember her channel happy&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:49.279" style="s2">did from emily leah who also so emily</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">lee also did</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.279" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">a a video saying she&#39;s not auntie mlm</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">and her</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">seemed to ring very true it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">i enjoyed her content well enough but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">seemed very</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">off the assembly line like yeah making</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">the same thing churning it out for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">unlike deanna who makes a lot of content</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">and i don&#39;t watch all of diana&#39;s content</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">but i don&#39;t find she&#39;s churning it out</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s i can feel her passion in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">it whereas emily leah i never found her</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">passionate about it and i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">why i just thought it was just her</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">and then when she was like i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">anti-mlm anymore it became very clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">she was only here for the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">and in the video where she states she</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">she&#39;s like she smiles just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">her business pod that she&#39;s gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">and she smiled and she&#39;s like i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">smiled in one of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">and yeah do what you love and this is my</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">big problem with the whole auntie lem</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">but just drama and in general</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re looking for the drama</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">or even if you&#39;re looking to not</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">perpetuate the drama there&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">difference of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">that person is wrong or the community is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">wrong versus</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">none of that matters i&#39;m here to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">from me right i watched kimberlea</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">because i knew she would trigger me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">i would learn things from being</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">triggered cool what am i here for what</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">am i here for like when she talks about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">the like purity of the influencers</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">against the mlm i&#39;m like you guys are</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">connected with where i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">i like your personality i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">you&#39;re just here for the money and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">so they&#39;re the ones who you and i ended</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">this thing i talk about constantly in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">the project that i&#39;m doing of profit</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">versus purpose</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">and how you can only serve one of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">is your master are you here for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">are you here for profit and the anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be more versed in that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">who i think are here for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">even though they&#39;re also getting profit</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">off of it um i do feel like illuminati&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">here for because of just what she covers</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">on the rest of her</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">her her stuff um she chooses to cover</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">other scams some of which i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">some which i don&#39;t we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">we&#39;re different on one of her big topics</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">um that isn&#39;t to do with business</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">but she but i enjoy hers i feel like she</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">is here for that but she also has not</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">she also it&#39;s hard to make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">purely for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">where your profit is also there but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">like which one&#39;s your master you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">to create content for you that you enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">because then it makes sense and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">part of what kimberley was saying was</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t enjoy the content that gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">gets her the most views</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">and so should she continue making it no</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">but of course her personality is going</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">to tell her she should</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">because her she&#39;s here for profit she i</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">don&#39;t think she was ever unclear about</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">she was like i found the algorithm the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">algorithm worked</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">and you could tell by the way she shows</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">up that&#39;s what she was doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">um and emily leah a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">and she came to that realization i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">while watching kimberlea do her so i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">think she looked</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">to kimberlea as somewhat of a auntie mlm</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">and youtuber idol</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">and was like oh yeah i&#39;m in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">boat as her</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">but hers actually seemed more genuine</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">like she didn&#39;t even realize that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">she was doing until she realized it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">then wanted to get out of it and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">of the same critiques she had about mlm</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">she was being put back on her and she</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">was like yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">personal growth which is like oh what</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;m doing to you what i&#39;m critical of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">you doing to others is what i&#39;m doing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">and i see that in every community all</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">and this is part of the issue is when</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">you look at a community</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">as an individual she&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">piss you off</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">like if you look at any group of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a whole person watching</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not used to doing these live at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">moment i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a game b</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">person or an anti-mlm person um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re a gambie person you might not</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">want to watch this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">that there is a um</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">what&#39;s it getting into that piece of if</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">you&#39;re here for purpose or profit</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">um if you&#39;re here for profit then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">going to create your entire content to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">get you the most money</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">and therefore you&#39;re going to your soul</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">is going to leave from it and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be there for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">that you were there for anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">um but you can still somewhat do that in</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">a market that isn&#39;t saturated</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">but the ant alone community is saturated</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s enough anti-mlm content creators</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">we do not need any more but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">individual might need to put it out</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">right that&#39;s different but</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">if there are people who are here for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">purpose of trying to get people to not</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">part of an amalgamist group as opposed</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">online but there&#39;s a very big difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">of creating for myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">and creating for the world that i want</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">to create that i want to live into</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">versus creating things for the youtube</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because one of my comments</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">what was my comment this morning</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">something about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">oh someone we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">cooperatives and such and someone was</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">like how do you decide</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">oh i got introduced to somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it was like socialist but not</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">marxist who everyone else probably knows</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">and the name</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">written is different than how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">pronounced so i&#39;m not gonna remember the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">name but it&#39;s about mutualism and such</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">and someone&#39;s like well how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">decide it&#39;s based on hourly work and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">have an issue with us getting paid based</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">on hourly work because of my disability</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">i only have</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">way less hours than most people but</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">innovation wise i</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">have a lot of innovative ideas and so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">we&#39;re only paying on labor i have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">problem with that and for only pain on</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">innovative ideas i have a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">that especially since</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">all of these thought thinkers to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">were like from the 1800s early 1900s we</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t have automation we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">like labor&#39;s going away</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">innovation isn&#39;t anyway so um i asked i</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">was like so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">if you did this video and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">you took 100 hours through this video</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:10.799" style="s2">and someone else took 10 hours to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">this video</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:14.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s the same basically the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">content same informative same</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">around the same length you get paid do</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">you get paid more based because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">spent more time</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">or do you get paid equal because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">audience gets the same amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">out of it or</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">that i was like do you get paid based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">the amount of people who watch and how</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">happy they are with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">oh my god youtube has already done you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">like you&#39;ve already done mutualism</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s like that&#39;s kind of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">or they figured out their own thing like</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">that did almost seem the most fair</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">and yet the algorithm breaks everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">else in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">our our gaming world and so influencer</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">the issue is gossip and drama cells</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">so we click on the titles that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">dishing the t on the anti-mlm community</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">or like i</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">when one content creator you know was</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">part of it has something to say about</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">the other content creator and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">create titles so we want to click on it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">and then therefore they&#39;re more likely</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">to create more drama and have more of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">those things going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">because they get more views and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">perpetuated system</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">in in our social media which i know cnn</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">goggles you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">you&#39;re on you&#39;re dealing with it our our</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">is decided by like our basest emotions</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">which is okay if you&#39;re aware of that i</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">know mine are still decided on my basis</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">emotions but when i feel triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">someone else there&#39;s my learning there</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">and so in watching all of this anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">there&#39;s part of me that is</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">as opposed to dealing with what she was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">actually saying and doing and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">lot of what</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">we&#39;re picking apart what somebody looks</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s part of your story and</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that comes in where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">like okay are we critiquing mlm</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">and the predatory structure or</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">critiquing the person</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to critique the person</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to belittle people on what</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">they look like or they were stupid for</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">getting involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been involved in mlms and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">most people in the auntie animal</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">community have been involved with one</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">person who got me involved in the auntie</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">ellen community though i am still like</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">oh my god how</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">how how did you do that based on who she</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">pop this up here so i can actually read</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">it marketing is so important it might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">good to have gossipy stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">because attention is still attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">even if it&#39;s gossip yeah exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">that is exactly what happens and then we</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">they create more of it and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">like how dare you create it and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">in a very saturated niche</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">and so although yes they&#39;re all bud like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">they&#39;re they are literally recreating</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">the mlm drama of like the community</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">uh that isn&#39;t really a community once</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">once you start poking holes in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">the product that is like yes but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">slinging the product too and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">represent</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">the same one it&#39;s anti-mlm and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">if we can deal with people as</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">individuals there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">anti-mlm community we didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">together and vote on and decide</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">like yes this is what we represent</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t like mlms and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">see them</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">as um predatory and yet in that world me</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">dealing with my</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">in the anti-mlm community right being</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">triggered by content creators and having</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">my solution raisings and doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">my little brain developed an mlm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">gonna save the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">like the irony in that is because i</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t focused on the drama i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">focused on</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">oh my god did you see what they did i</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">mean i was a little bit don&#39;t get me</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s part of it is being in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">that and being like oh i feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">in junior high that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting which is also</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why i need to mention this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">um madison was talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">kimberley should know better because</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">she&#39;s like almost 40</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">and and uh emilia is only like 18 19.</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">i was like i feel called out here</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">because i&#39;m 40 i feel like i&#39;m like 18</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">19. my body feels like it&#39;s 80.</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">my soul feels like i don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">simultaneously it&#39;s it&#39;s 7</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">and infinity it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">all tied together</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">like how and so i am i did actually put</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">out to one of the anti-mlm groups that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">i&#39;m part of on facebook to do a solution</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">raising on mlms which we&#39;ll be doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">a week from this thursday if people take</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">me up on it i had someone request one</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t during the workday i was</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">okay me and my brain will figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">for one day to be there</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">at i think i said 5 p.m so we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">my brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">does we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see how it works at</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">5pm and today in a few hours we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">the very</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">first day of meta learning magic</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">which is my mlm the mlm i&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">where it&#39;s completely different than all</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">of the other ones that are out there</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">which is why i can be anti-mlm and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">create an mlm</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">is because i&#39;m here first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">to dismantle capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">and create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">everyone and without using that exact</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:33.280" style="s2">language because</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t really create something by</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.280" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">dismantling something you have to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">not just like destroying something still</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">important especially if it&#39;s destructive</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the same as creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">something and so i just asked one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">other groups that i&#39;m part of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">getting triggered all over the place i</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">love it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">um about creating a moneyless society</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">cooperative and you if anyone knows me</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;m all about cooperatives that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">got onto youtube it&#39;s like we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">to have a global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">and when i say cooperative i mean very</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">much consumer cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">which i hate the word consumer so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">user cooperative but there&#39;s i know</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">and then people are like just coming to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">cooperative ideas just</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">my family just coming to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">mondragon is like have you ever heard of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">mondragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">yeah decades ago when i first started</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">talking or a decade ago when i first</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">started talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s that that like weird tension</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">we&#39;re having in the world right now of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">like both</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">why won&#39;t the world wake up to what i</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">know and simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">as they wake up how are you just waking</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">up to this and like we can&#39;t help it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">both ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like it does frustrate me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">that these people in the in</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">cooperative one that dismantles</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">capitalism is basically what they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">purpose of that can&#39;t be the mission of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">your cooperative it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">pro-something not anti-something</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">it has to be and weirdly talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">the nt11 community</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">but in this case it is it&#39;s about the</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s toxic and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">predatory towards people and so yes that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">is actually what they&#39;re doing you will</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">know we have succeeded in anti-mlm when</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">mlms aren&#39;t allowed</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">ironically i might make that more</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">feasible</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">by creating my mlm because my mlm is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">here to create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">everyone and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">the powers that be might decide to then</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">mlms are not allowed none of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">structure is allowed even though they</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">would have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">a really hard time ever doing that to us</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">not them</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">because ours has none of the predatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">structure that they would have to cancel</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">us over without canceling them but they</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">might they might find a way for sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">um when i get to any of this gossip</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">sells drama cells</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">money is what a lot of these people</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">especially kimberlea i wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">emily leah i don&#39;t think she was</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">necessarily seeking money but i do think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">she found a niche and was like oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">getting subscribers but she built her</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">entire thing on this so that now to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">change and become auntie mlm</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s going to hurt her algorithm and she</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">actually learned a lot on how to edit</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">video and how to do thumbnails i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">and how to build an audience and engage</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">with an audience</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">and if she was doing that on content she</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t passionate about doing it on</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">business doing on something she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">passionate about i think will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">will be good uh mlms oh that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">have here just that mlms are</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">they are capitalism like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">microcosm capitalism so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">an mlm but you can&#39;t critique capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s a lot of of seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t like in yourself in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">and then yelling at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know what is it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">in an mlm that isn&#39;t in capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">because i&#39;m anti-capitalism so maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">but then i also through being anti-mlm</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">created an mlm that&#39;s going to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">capitalism so</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all kinds of ironic and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">chaotic which welcome to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">mlms are toxic they&#39;re top-heavy this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">what i mean when i say mlms or like</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:47.840" style="s2">capitalism itself is very top-heavy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">designed to be a pyramid it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">to have very few people at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">to make you feel bad if you&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">bottom if you&#39;re at the bottom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">because you&#39;re lazy and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">working hard enough and it&#39;s on you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">the people at the top got to the top</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">just fine what&#39;s wrong with you and yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">and mlm&#39;s literally designed that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">can&#39;t do that once you get in near the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">bottom but so is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">capitalism good luck creating the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">amazon the next facebook is already here</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">yes you might call it the new innovative</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s one out of billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">millionaires are made in the mlm</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">community in fact more millionaires are</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">made in the mlm community than most</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">industries just because of how they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">designed we&#39;re going to recreate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">but not get anyone to millionaire</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">status get people to 120 000 a year</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">status</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not status access to resources uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">so the other thing besides the top-heavy</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">business structure which</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">very capitalistic is this personality of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">toxic conformity of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">okay if you&#39;re oh my god even in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">the moneyless society rbe space</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">i think it was that one someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">talking about a co-op and someone was</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">like i think we should create a plastics</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">co-op like it&#39;s the only option the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">other person&#39;s like that&#39;s not very</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">our genetic self are like</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to breed with them or</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">something and we think they&#39;re a better</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">person yeah they might be a better</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">person to breed with except even that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">a lie because they probably had cosmetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">surgery they&#39;re definitely wearing</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">makeup they probably have photoshop</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">their shirt if you&#39;re just looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">photo</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">but the but they also grew up in a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">where they had very little draw very</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">stuff to overcome very little and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">the more beautiful you are the probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">the less likely you are to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">person the less likely you are to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">able to be a competent leader</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">and yet we&#39;re going to give you the role</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">and we do that time and time again in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">society the people that can sound</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">even though they don&#39;t know the f</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about are</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">going to be who we give the roles right</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">we give the roles to the over estimators</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">not the underestimators and we should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">dealing with the underestimators if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">look at autism itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">i would prefer our politicians and ceos</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">to all be autistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">hands down but we&#39;re never gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">them in power so now the odd one can get</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">in because they can mask and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;re damn good at masking so the ones</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">that are good at masking can be even</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">better at that but that&#39;s basically why</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">politicians and then we&#39;re there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">because they&#39;re really good at lying and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">putting on a persona</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s who we have in the positions</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">of power and so this personality</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">conformity cult</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">happens in capitalism in our democracies</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">just the same as it does in lms</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">we just it&#39;s slightly bigger right like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">like a cult is a very small</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:39.919" style="s2">is a much smaller box and mlms are just</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">capitalistic cults um capitalism in</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.919" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">general our society in general has a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">slightly bigger box you&#39;re accepted in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s still a box you&#39;re still not</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">allowed to be on the outside you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">still not allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s can we design the box</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">to be bigger</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">can you be a can you just have any</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">personality and be part of a system</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">i think that would be the best for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">individual in the system</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">and then uh the other part is this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">idea of products in general</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">that in an mlm there&#39;s this like idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">that the products there to help you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">it was illegal it wouldn&#39;t be there if</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">it was toxic it wouldn&#39;t be there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">like the fda simultaneously will save</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">you and is the devil</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like they didn&#39;t okay it but they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">also come in and stop it if it was too</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">bad no</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">they didn&#39;t no it doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">basically a lot of the products on our</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">shelves now are they making people</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">die like just keel over and die no but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">they&#39;re causing cancer and infertility</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">and all these things in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">and yet we we&#39;re like well they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">the shelf so they have to be safe</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">or well the company it&#39;s like no company</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">is there for you they&#39;re there to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">profit mlms are just another layer of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">like they don&#39;t have the liability</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">because they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">hire people they don&#39;t actually hire to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">market and sell their product to their</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">and they can lie about it and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">the ones that are liable instead of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">but they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">lies are coming from down telephone all</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">the way down</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">and so those are the three like</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s taught it&#39;s a top-heavy structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">the personality cult stills exists and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">the products are still crap and we only</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">trust them because of marketing</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">whereas all of those things we could do</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">better right we can create products that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">we trust because we know what&#39;s in them</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">and if it we can choose what</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">preservatives are in it and is it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">trade-off worth it right like we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.279" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">create things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">even if we&#39;re not involved the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">that are involved we can trust because</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not there for profit</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">they&#39;re there for purpose as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">make profit the driving factor if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">get people to create a company</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">that creates goods and profits their</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">driving factor</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">then they&#39;re going to lie about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">in it and they&#39;re going to try and scam</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">they&#39;re going to try to like well they</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">lied so i&#39;ve got to lie a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">more and a little bit more and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">recreate what we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">if we can have transparency and truth we</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">can create products that we act and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">services that we actually trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">the personality that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">uncomfortable to be with people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">don&#39;t act the way you thought that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">should and they&#39;re not doing it that way</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yep</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">welcome to humanity that is if if</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">somebody&#39;s triggering you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">you can you can yell at them to change</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">spoiler alert they&#39;re probably not going</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">to or you can change and realize that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">you&#39;re probably reacting to your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">reaction to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">rather than what they&#39;re actually they</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">said something you think they said</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">something else you think that their tone</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">is different so i don&#39;t type online</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">this is conversation this plastic i had</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">a great idea for cooperative and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">cooperative people were like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">going to create an anti-capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">cooperative</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">professionalism and actually his idea is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">really great</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">and i can see i can i can feel it in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">body because i feel it that frustration</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">decade</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve surpassed it i know think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">worker cooperatives are the solution</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">because they were only the solution if</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">they started decades ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">right but people have to catch up to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">that before they can surpass it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">but i get frustrated because i&#39;m like no</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">consumer cooperative what&#39;s wrong with</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s like that tension it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">not let anger or frustration come out</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">when you&#39;re typing or when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">and sometimes being autistic i look</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">frustrated or angry but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know why that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">it just does funny</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel but it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">coming out of my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">that there&#39;s yeah personality we can we</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">can create a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">a culture of inclusivity of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">and that is what we are going to do in</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">better learning magic and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">be messy</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">but luckily i just figured out a week i</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">don&#39;t need to create a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">works for 7.5 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">i have to create a culture that works</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">for me literally</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve invited five other people to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">part of this conversation today</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">and they&#39;re all people that i love that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">i feel comfortable with i can show up</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">and make a mess</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">no problem they&#39;re used to it they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">shown up to my other stuff and i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">a mess</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna invite them to make messes</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">and they can invite people we can invite</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">people that we feel comfortable enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">so hopefully if they don&#39;t work in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">time slot they work in their time slot</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.399" style="s2">but like we&#39;re growing something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">like do we feel comfortable showing up</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.399" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">as ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">how do we invite other people to feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">comfortable showing up as themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">how do we actually create that culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">if we fail at it none of us are getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">220 thousand dollars a year</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">and if we succeed at it million a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">million of us are getting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">retire to a cooperative system not at</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">what our mlm is doing meta learning</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">is creating something that isn&#39;t top</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">heavy i&#39;ll be the first person because</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">i&#39;m the founding member i&#39;m the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">looking for the 10 who will find the 100</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.359" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not and then i&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">million</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">120 is the cap so you can&#39;t make more</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">think it is because we&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">like</p>
