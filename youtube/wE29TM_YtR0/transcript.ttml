<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">a little bit more about each of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">gentlemen later on in the program but</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">what I would like to say now is from my</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">experience working with dr. Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve seen it heard about dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">arthur hansen these are two true</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">renaissance men and we are very excited</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">to have him here this evening so before</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">I get to our speakers I&#39;m going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">you a little bit about Finn Finn is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">your conventional environmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">organization all of our executive</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:48.149" style="s2">members have a background in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">as opposed to engineering environmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">studies or biology now this leads to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">some special benefits that we have I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">going to tell you about three different</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">oh well the special benefits are that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">can use our knowledge of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">emotion and behavior to develop</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">innovative angles on how to publicize</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">the problem of marine life decimation so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you about three</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">different psychological concepts that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">try to integrate into our advertising</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">over the past couple months so the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">is that images of cute animals induce</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">positive emotion and neuro attentional</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">focus that&#39;s probably not what you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">expecting to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">Fred the fish doesn&#39;t quite do it for</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">you does he so we had to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">we had to approach this problem that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">fish and their appearance don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">draw that fuzzy emotion from you that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">you really want to help them out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:57.150" style="s2">probably a lot better so we took the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">approach that if I don&#39;t know if any of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.150" end="00:02:03.150" style="s2">you have pets but you know that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">their food bowl is full we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.150" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">happy now if you take that food away</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:11.430" style="s2">like for example if fish were to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:16.590" style="s2">suddenly be gone which is one of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.430" end="00:02:18.150" style="s2">food sources not so happy now you got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.590" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">slogan to it there you go that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.150" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">our first advertisements so the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">concept that I&#39;m going to go over is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">that we&#39;ve actually borrowed from social</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">psychology research and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">that&#39;s called the door in the face</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">technique so the gist of this technique</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">is that you initially make a large</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:44.340" style="s2">request from an individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">probably going to be shut down that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.340" end="00:02:47.100" style="s2">probably going to be the answer that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get so then you follow</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:54.840" style="s2">up this request with a much smaller more</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">reasonable one of course they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:03:03.030" style="s2">to so the reason behind that is that an</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">individual is more likely to agree to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.030" end="00:03:07.880" style="s2">the second more reasonable request what</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">is R appreciated by an outlandish one</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.880" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">versus has it hadn&#39;t been asked on its</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">own so the final concept that I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">to go over it&#39;s going to require a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:20.160" style="s2">little bit of background knowledge which</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:22.110" style="s2">I&#39;m going to discuss and it&#39;s an angle</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.160" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">that we decide to take about the health</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.110" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">benefits that you receive when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">ingest fish or possibly fish oil now I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">imagine that many of you know who this</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:37.709" style="s2">is this is sy he&#39;s best known for his</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:39.980" style="s2">dancing Gangnam style if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.709" end="00:03:41.379" style="s2">him you can ask for students on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.980" end="00:03:43.610" style="s2">potentially your children tonight</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.379" end="00:03:47.810" style="s2">they&#39;re very familiar with him</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.610" end="00:03:51.319" style="s2">so Gangnam style is essentially a well</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.810" end="00:03:54.260" style="s2">refers to a district in Seoul South</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.319" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">Korea and the people who live there they</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.260" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">have a very affluent lifestyle and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.510" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">achieve this wealth pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">overnight they didn&#39;t exactly have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:06.890" style="s2">work for so because of this it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:10.129" style="s2">related to this aphorism with great</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.890" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">power comes great responsibility because</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.129" end="00:04:12.590" style="s2">of the fact that they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.540" style="s2">work for their wealth and it came</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">overnight they don&#39;t really have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.540" end="00:04:18.680" style="s2">of their social responsibility so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:21.799" style="s2">decided to take this and related to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.680" end="00:04:24.470" style="s2">finish when it comes to eating fish</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.799" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">we&#39;re all living Gangnam style basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.470" end="00:04:28.970" style="s2">what this means is that we were born</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:30.949" style="s2">into a world that has oceans that were</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.970" end="00:04:34.610" style="s2">kind of this brave resource it was we</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.949" end="00:04:36.169" style="s2">were rich with fish but because of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.610" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really develop at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.169" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">time that sense of responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">we have to maintain our oceans and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:48.050" style="s2">maintain their sense sustainability so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:49.760" style="s2">now to the psychological concept this</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.050" end="00:04:51.349" style="s2">author is in that we decided to use it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.760" end="00:04:53.210" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough we wanted to take it one</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.349" end="00:04:55.599" style="s2">step further that&#39;s what we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.210" end="00:04:57.979" style="s2">doing we&#39;re really really pushing so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.599" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">when you eat fish it helps with early</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.979" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">brain development and the prevention or</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:03.950" style="s2">treatment of brain related problems so</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:06.470" style="s2">again referring to the food chain like</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.950" end="00:05:09.289" style="s2">we did before how cats they eat fish we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.470" end="00:05:13.460" style="s2">have to think who really wants a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.289" end="00:05:16.099" style="s2">healthy bringing zombies zombies eat</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.460" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">brains and they want them to be good as</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.099" end="00:05:21.830" style="s2">opposed to unhealthy and we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">because in Toronto we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.830" end="00:05:27.289" style="s2">zombies so you add that to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:30.289" style="s2">people like to dance Gangnam style</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:32.030" style="s2">and now just to summarize and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.289" end="00:05:33.979" style="s2">that you&#39;re following me you have Tom</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.030" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">B&#39;s who need good brains and because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.979" end="00:05:40.010" style="s2">that they need fish you add that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.510" style="s2">dancing Gangnam style you add that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.010" end="00:05:45.229" style="s2">the author ISM that we developed about</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.510" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">fish and how we&#39;re all living Gangnam</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.229" end="00:05:51.860" style="s2">style and the next logical progression</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:52.409" style="s2">that we were going to do zombies dancing</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.860" end="00:05:53.849" style="s2">gang</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.409" end="00:05:55.769" style="s2">style bearing fish shirts with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.849" end="00:05:57.539" style="s2">catchphrase at the end now you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.769" end="00:05:59.669" style="s2">surprised to know that we were actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.539" end="00:06:01.589" style="s2">beaten to the punch there is already a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.669" end="00:06:03.269" style="s2">zombie that dances Gangnam style and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.589" end="00:06:05.789" style="s2">does a pretty good Michael Jackson and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.269" end="00:06:10.529" style="s2">Elvis Presley as well so we had to dog</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.789" end="00:06:13.619" style="s2">we have to pitch this idea but on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.529" end="00:06:15.059" style="s2">serious note this really has been one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.619" end="00:06:16.860" style="s2">the most rewarding but challenging</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.059" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">projects I have had the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.860" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">work on you soon learn that one-tenth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:23.969" style="s2">the battle is pulling together the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.569" style="s2">correct data the rest is communication</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.969" end="00:06:28.559" style="s2">and finding ways to make people listen</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.569" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">something that I quickly learned while</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.559" end="00:06:31.469" style="s2">growing up and trying to get my parents</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">to see things my way</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.469" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">is that everyone has a different</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.449" end="00:12:03.089" style="s2">quite a long time ago now there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.420" end="00:12:05.670" style="s2">lot of North versus South ideology in it</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:11.009" style="s2">developing at an incredible rate and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.569" end="00:12:13.620" style="s2">there was a lot of left versus right</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.620" end="00:12:17.699" style="s2">appropriate in the modern world to note</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.690" end="00:12:19.560" style="s2">that problems of this magnitude have to</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:29.069" style="s2">was a lot of underlying the underlying</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.069" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">better off without people on it which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">not a position that I hold and which I</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.000" end="00:13:01.949" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to put things in context</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.509" end="00:16:12.040" style="s2">seen happening is horrible governments</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:14.709" style="s2">toppling one after another at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.040" end="00:16:16.649" style="s2">really a miraculous rate you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.709" end="00:16:19.389" style="s2">that&#39;s all on top of the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.649" end="00:16:21.550" style="s2">Soviet Union and you know the demolition</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.389" end="00:16:23.500" style="s2">of the Iron Curtain and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.550" end="00:16:26.290" style="s2">that for someone my age seemed</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.500" end="00:16:29.259" style="s2">absolutely miraculous not not to mention</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.290" end="00:16:31.269" style="s2">of course the opening up of China so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.259" end="00:16:33.459" style="s2">know three cheers for the human race</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.269" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty damn good that we&#39;ve managed</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.459" end="00:16:38.350" style="s2">to put those sort of successes together</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:40.540" style="s2">I mean the UN had a millennium goal in</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.350" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">2000 to cut poverty in the world by half</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.540" end="00:16:46.889" style="s2">by 2015 they figured they hit that by</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:49.509" style="s2">2011 so you know these things are just</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.889" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">any any person with any sense would</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.509" end="00:16:54.750" style="s2">regard that fundamentally as miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:56.920" style="s2">its massive economic productivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.750" end="00:17:00.420" style="s2">increases combined with massive</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.920" end="00:17:04.329" style="s2">population increases I mean so you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.420" end="00:17:06.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not all gloomy and so the UN and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.329" end="00:17:07.959" style="s2">the initial UN record have virtually</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.130" end="00:17:09.880" style="s2">none of that in there I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.959" end="00:17:11.650" style="s2">real mistake you know because human</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.640" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">know we&#39;re not doing that bad we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.890" end="00:17:34.900" style="s2">even understand oceanic ecology at all</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.809" end="00:17:42.850" style="s2">things as fast as we can so you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.940" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">credit where credit&#39;s due and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.850" end="00:17:48.190" style="s2">lot of credit due and it&#39;s also really</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.590" style="s2">important not to make the case that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.190" end="00:17:53.260" style="s2">everything is terrible because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.590" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a low-resolution thoughtless case</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.260" end="00:17:58.090" style="s2">you know you have to concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:17:59.409" style="s2">things and differentiate between them so</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.090" end="00:18:00.940" style="s2">you know the difference between things</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.940" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">because of everything is a problem well</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.010" end="00:18:05.799" style="s2">you might as well just sit at home and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">drink gin because</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.799" end="00:18:09.820" style="s2">nothing you can do about it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:11.230" style="s2">the truth of the matter is is that when</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.820" end="00:18:13.960" style="s2">we put our minds together we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.230" end="00:18:16.450" style="s2">actually fix things pretty fast and part</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.960" end="00:18:18.399" style="s2">of the necessity that precedes fixing</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.450" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">things is to become informed enough so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.399" end="00:18:21.340" style="s2">that you understand at least to some</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.340" end="00:18:25.509" style="s2">so I&#39;m hoping that to some minimal</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.659" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">well corruptions still bad and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.570" end="00:18:41.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a cause of suffering that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.320" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">for political reasons and there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:48.369" style="s2">and I would say that&#39;s basically a waste</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.539" end="00:18:50.769" style="s2">management problem and it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.369" end="00:18:52.600" style="s2">problem that faces really any creature</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.769" end="00:18:54.549" style="s2">because all creatures have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.600" end="00:18:56.049" style="s2">their waste and of course maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.549" end="00:18:57.669" style="s2">produce a bit more of it than we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.049" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">because we&#39;re pretty smart and we build</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.669" end="00:19:02.289" style="s2">lots of things but you know it is part</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:05.019" style="s2">and parcel of living in a universe where</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.289" end="00:19:07.090" style="s2">the primary force is thermodynamic</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.179" end="00:19:14.619" style="s2">an 8 li evil that we produce byproducts</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.519" end="00:19:16.389" style="s2">it&#39;s because life is very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.619" end="00:19:18.039" style="s2">difficult to sustain and we want to live</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.389" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">longer and no wonder and we&#39;d rather</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:24.149" style="s2">than they had to and that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.519" end="00:19:26.499" style="s2">good thing too so we&#39;ve got our reasons</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.149" end="00:19:29.139" style="s2">however when I was going through all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.499" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">this you know there was a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.139" end="00:19:33.460" style="s2">things that really stuck out for me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:35.739" style="s2">one of them was the oceanic problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.460" end="00:19:37.690" style="s2">because well there was a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.739" end="00:19:40.059" style="s2">reasons the first was because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.690" end="00:19:42.869" style="s2">that data indicating that what we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.059" end="00:19:45.249" style="s2">doing was damaging was really</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.869" end="00:19:47.980" style="s2">incontrovertible as opposed to many of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.249" end="00:19:50.259" style="s2">the issues that you hear about from time</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.980" end="00:19:53.279" style="s2">to time or maybe constantly it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.259" end="00:19:56.590" style="s2">very clear that we&#39;re overfishing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.279" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">overfishing dramatically and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.590" end="00:20:00.580" style="s2">doing other things to the oceanic</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:03.190" style="s2">environment that are definitely not in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.580" end="00:20:05.230" style="s2">our medium or long term interest to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.190" end="00:20:07.989" style="s2">nothing about the creatures themselves I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.230" end="00:20:09.909" style="s2">also thought that oceanic the oceanic</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.989" end="00:20:12.309" style="s2">management problem was an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.909" end="00:20:14.590" style="s2">problem to consider from a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.309" end="00:20:18.009" style="s2">practical perspective I mean I thought a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.590" end="00:20:19.080" style="s2">lot about global warming and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.009" end="00:20:21.119" style="s2">going to talk much about</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.080" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">global warming because that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.119" end="00:20:24.570" style="s2">I&#39;m here to talk about but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">things I did realize about global</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.570" end="00:20:30.179" style="s2">warming rapidly was that the error in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:32.549" style="s2">the estimates of the likely warming of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.179" end="00:20:35.369" style="s2">the planet over the next 60 years are so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.549" end="00:20:37.619" style="s2">large even if they&#39;re done by the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.369" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">scientists they&#39;re so large that even if</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.619" end="00:20:42.299" style="s2">we stopped using anything that produced</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:45.119" style="s2">carbon dioxide now we would never know</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.299" end="00:20:46.619" style="s2">if that actually helped and when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.119" end="00:20:47.820" style="s2">looked at that I thought well how in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.619" end="00:20:50.580" style="s2">world are you going to sell something</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.820" end="00:20:51.809" style="s2">like that you even if it works you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.580" end="00:20:53.879" style="s2">tell if it worked</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.809" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">plus you know that the time course of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.879" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">improvement is over multiple decades and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:01.919" style="s2">everyone uses hydro carbon energy so</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:04.049" style="s2">it&#39;s a real killer to try to address it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.919" end="00:21:05.759" style="s2">seemed to me that it was more logical in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.049" end="00:21:08.129" style="s2">some ways to focus on problems at a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.759" end="00:21:10.859" style="s2">shorter horizon and somewhat more</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.129" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">immediate returns because that way you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.859" end="00:21:14.580" style="s2">can tell if all the effort that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:16.019" style="s2">putting into solving the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.580" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">actually having some sort of positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.019" end="00:21:20.700" style="s2">consequence and the Oceanic management</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.840" end="00:21:24.359" style="s2">problems seem to fit into that too was</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.700" end="00:21:26.279" style="s2">wasn&#39;t intractable it wasn&#39;t a problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.359" end="00:21:28.980" style="s2">that was rapidly disappearing on its own</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.279" end="00:21:30.629" style="s2">like world poverty seems to me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.980" end="00:21:32.460" style="s2">think you can speed that up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.629" end="00:21:34.200" style="s2">disappearance of poverty anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.460" end="00:21:36.779" style="s2">it&#39;s being sped up it&#39;s sort of hitting</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.200" end="00:21:39.539" style="s2">maximum improvement so it sort of falls</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.779" end="00:21:41.700" style="s2">into the category of solvable problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.539" end="00:21:43.799" style="s2">with potentially proper interventions</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.700" end="00:21:45.899" style="s2">the other thing is as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.799" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no losers to fixing this</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.899" end="00:21:52.049" style="s2">you know the Oceanic mismanagement</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:53.999" style="s2">problem is of such magnitude with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.049" end="00:21:56.249" style="s2">exception of certain species that if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.999" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">keep up our rate of fishing for the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.249" end="00:22:00.029" style="s2">20 years there&#39;s not going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:01.619" style="s2">awful lot left and that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.029" end="00:22:04.769" style="s2">be very good for the large corporations</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.619" end="00:22:06.929" style="s2">that you know that make their economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.769" end="00:22:09.450" style="s2">living off the oceans it&#39;s be a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.929" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">hard on us if we want to eat and then of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.450" end="00:22:13.759" style="s2">course there&#39;s the loss of the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">and the diversity and and also the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.759" end="00:22:18.450" style="s2">potential to truly transform the nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:20.970" style="s2">of the ecosystems of the ocean in a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.450" end="00:22:23.249" style="s2">that really won&#39;t be good I mean our</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.970" end="00:22:25.619" style="s2">planets covered 2/3 by oceans and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.249" end="00:22:27.539" style="s2">a lot and we&#39;re messing with them in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.619" end="00:22:29.429" style="s2">really serious way and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.539" end="00:22:31.110" style="s2">reason for that is you know fish or fish</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.429" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got scales and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.110" end="00:22:35.730" style="s2">that brainian we&#39;re going after them</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.059" end="00:22:37.559" style="s2">with like 21st century technology you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.730" end="00:22:40.070" style="s2">know we use planes to spot them and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.559" end="00:22:44.549" style="s2">sonar to find out where they are and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.070" end="00:22:45.929" style="s2">like ultrasonic mapping to to to check</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.549" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">out the structure at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.929" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">ocean and massive nets and like those</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">bloody things don&#39;t have a chance and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:53.730" style="s2">that&#39;s not so good</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:56.130" style="s2">you know it&#39;s inappropriate use of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.730" end="00:22:57.990" style="s2">technology now there&#39;s some real reasons</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.130" end="00:23:00.809" style="s2">for it now</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.990" end="00:23:03.090" style="s2">as I said I&#39;m a lay person I read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.809" end="00:23:05.220" style="s2">I probably read about 40 books and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.090" end="00:23:06.929" style="s2">whole pile of papers on this topic and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.220" end="00:23:08.910" style="s2">others and some of them were really</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.929" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">helpful and these are some of them the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.910" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">end of the line is a great book and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.830" end="00:23:15.390" style="s2">these are very straightforward books to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:17.580" style="s2">read they&#39;re very engaging unnatural</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.580" end="00:23:21.059" style="s2">important fish in the sea that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:22.470" style="s2">this little herring like fish that lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.059" end="00:23:24.750" style="s2">off the Atlantic coast called the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.470" end="00:23:28.440" style="s2">Manhattan which is kind of an inedible</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.750" end="00:23:30.270" style="s2">oily beast of a herring and it at least</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.440" end="00:23:31.650" style="s2">one time numbered in the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.270" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">billions it might have been the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.650" end="00:23:34.049" style="s2">plentiful animal on the surface of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.049" end="00:23:38.040" style="s2">maybe out numbering all the other fish</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.090" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s at the very bottom of the food</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.040" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">chain and people can&#39;t really eat it but</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.290" end="00:23:47.910" style="s2">which seems you know really not all that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.030" end="00:23:50.490" style="s2">bright is vacuuming vacuuming them up</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.910" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">like mr. burns from The Simpsons and</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.620" end="00:24:04.860" style="s2">and a lot of that seems to have to do</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">because that&#39;s source material for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.549" end="00:24:42.890" style="s2">of what I&#39;m going to tell you now the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:45.050" style="s2">first thing I learned</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.890" end="00:24:47.630" style="s2">the oceans was that the oceans aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.050" end="00:24:49.490" style="s2">that big not when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.630" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">what lives in them because the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.490" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">actually have two kinds of structure and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:56.090" style="s2">one structure they call the pelagic zone</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:58.040" style="s2">and it only extends 50 miles from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.090" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">shore so it&#39;s like this little skinny</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.040" end="00:25:03.080" style="s2">you know offshoot of the continents</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:05.420" style="s2">essentially maybe you know it as the</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.370" end="00:25:12.020" style="s2">because it&#39;s only that deep light can</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.020" end="00:25:16.340" style="s2">you need light for things to grow</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.970" end="00:25:17.960" style="s2">especially plants and if plants can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.340" end="00:25:19.580" style="s2">grow then the animals can&#39;t eat anything</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.140" end="00:25:31.550" style="s2">exception is within 50 miles from shore</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.110" end="00:25:33.650" style="s2">and so and in these areas that are only</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.550" end="00:25:35.450" style="s2">you know 500 feet deep or less now if</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.650" end="00:25:39.140" style="s2">you look at this map the light blue</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.450" end="00:25:40.370" style="s2">areas there are the pelagic zone and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.140" end="00:25:42.050" style="s2">know they look pretty big up in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.370" end="00:25:43.550" style="s2">Arctic remember this is all stretched</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:46.340" style="s2">out because it&#39;s not a very intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.550" end="00:25:49.040" style="s2">projection but all the dark blue stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.340" end="00:25:51.710" style="s2">man that&#39;s deep two miles deep on</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.040" end="00:25:53.990" style="s2">average and it can be 11,000 feet deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:56.810" style="s2">in places and the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.990" end="00:25:59.000" style="s2">it&#39;s really dark no light gets down</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.810" end="00:26:01.430" style="s2">there it&#39;s really cold it&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.000" end="00:26:03.560" style="s2">above freezing it&#39;s really high pressure</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.430" end="00:26:06.140" style="s2">like higher pressure than the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.560" end="00:26:08.360" style="s2">Venus and so it&#39;s not that hospitable</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.140" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">for life there&#39;s not a lot around there</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.360" end="00:26:13.250" style="s2">and you know the problem with that at</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:15.680" style="s2">least in part is well a that&#39;s most of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.250" end="00:26:18.260" style="s2">the ocean and B it&#39;s mostly empty but</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.680" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s cold and dark the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.260" end="00:26:22.580" style="s2">that do live there well they&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">well understood but they also grow very</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.580" end="00:26:27.710" style="s2">fast so if you do fish them and we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:30.350" style="s2">fishing them then you know you fish them</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.710" end="00:26:32.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s like harvesting the trees that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.350" end="00:26:35.300" style="s2">grow up in the Arctic you know they take</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.360" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">forever to grow back so and as we fished</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.300" end="00:26:39.140" style="s2">out the pelagic zone which were which</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:41.240" style="s2">we&#39;re doing at a fairly rapid rate we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.140" end="00:26:43.790" style="s2">increasingly turned to the neritic zone</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.240" end="00:26:45.620" style="s2">with especially with trawlers that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.790" end="00:26:48.410" style="s2">now reach 2,000 meters down to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.620" end="00:26:50.750" style="s2">bottom of the ocean and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.410" end="00:26:52.310" style="s2">not high-quality food generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.750" end="00:26:54.650" style="s2">but the problem too is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.310" end="00:26:55.470" style="s2">understand it well and it seems quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.650" end="00:26:58.590" style="s2">easy to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.470" end="00:27:00.360" style="s2">devastate so anyway so that&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.590" end="00:27:02.520" style="s2">thing to know is but there really isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.360" end="00:27:04.230" style="s2">that much food bearing ocean and that a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.520" end="00:27:06.360" style="s2">lot of the planet is sort of covered by</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.230" end="00:27:10.140" style="s2">water that&#39;s too dark deep and cold to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.360" end="00:27:11.880" style="s2">be of a lot of use here&#39;s the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.140" end="00:27:14.909" style="s2">that really broke my heart I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.880" end="00:27:16.830" style="s2">reading this um because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.909" end="00:27:21.570" style="s2">things that these books taught me was</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.830" end="00:27:24.179" style="s2">just how much there was before we took</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.570" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">it and like I said I&#39;m not an anti-human</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.179" end="00:27:29.549" style="s2">in any way but the way this struck me</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:33.900" style="s2">was that it was a catastrophic aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.549" end="00:27:36.150" style="s2">and and spiritual loss a loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.900" end="00:27:39.059" style="s2">absolute bounty of the planet and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.150" end="00:27:40.530" style="s2">sort of thing that that evokes in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.059" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">viewer or the experience are the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.530" end="00:27:43.650" style="s2">sort of thing that maybe is a VOC when</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">you look up at the sky and see the vast</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.650" end="00:27:48.539" style="s2">array of star is sort of spread out</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:51.090" style="s2">before us the magnificence of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.539" end="00:27:53.730" style="s2">we&#39;re denying ourselves the privilege of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.090" end="00:27:55.500" style="s2">experiencing that increasingly so let me</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.730" end="00:27:57.270" style="s2">tell you what it was like when the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.500" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">Europeans first came to North America</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.270" end="00:28:00.929" style="s2">and you want to remember that this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:03.150" style="s2">even after the Native Americans had done</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.929" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">a fair bit of fishing and also after the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.150" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">Europeans had already pretty much fished</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:10.020" style="s2">out their waters completely sturgeon</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.700" style="s2">while sturgeons of prehistoric fish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.020" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">been around about sixty million years or</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.700" end="00:28:15.299" style="s2">so and they get really long and babe</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:17.070" style="s2">they get so big you have to haul them</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.299" end="00:28:19.950" style="s2">out of rivers with oxen they can weigh</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.070" end="00:28:21.630" style="s2">1200 pounds and they&#39;re hardly any on</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.950" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">the Atlantic coast anymore I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.630" end="00:28:25.530" style="s2">if there are any there&#39;s some still in</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:37.740" style="s2">sturgeon and shad are in such prodigious</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.280" end="00:28:40.950" style="s2">numbers that in one day within the space</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.950" end="00:28:46.289" style="s2">canoes caught about 600 of the former</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.100" end="00:28:47.970" style="s2">that was sturgeon with hooks which they</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.289" end="00:28:49.740" style="s2">let down to the bottom and drew up at a</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">against the fish and of the latter shad</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.179" style="s2">about five thousand have been caught in</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:29:00.030" style="s2">one single hole of the net so it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.179" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">possible to catch 600 sturgeon in one</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.030" end="00:29:03.240" style="s2">day I don&#39;t imagine that six hundred</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:35.089" style="s2">thing to do is to get your sheep out</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.980" end="00:36:36.980" style="s2">there and let them eat all the grass</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.089" end="00:36:39.079" style="s2">before the next guy gets his sheep out</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.079" end="00:36:44.930" style="s2">so the tragedy of Commons is that when</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.750" end="00:37:33.740" style="s2">the things that makes regulation</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.970" end="00:37:35.660" style="s2">difficult is what&#39;s being described as</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.740" end="00:37:37.430" style="s2">technological creep so you say you might</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.660" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">say well you know maybe you can limit</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.430" end="00:37:40.940" style="s2">your boat to 40 the boats that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:42.049" style="s2">allowed to fish to 40 feet in length or</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.940" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">something like that instead of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.049" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">massive factory boats that go out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.790" style="s2">you know sit on the ocean for my</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">vacuum up everything in your trailer the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.790" end="00:37:52.660" style="s2">problem with technological creep which</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.340" style="s2">sounds like a you know maybe some kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.660" end="00:37:58.570" style="s2">of computer programmer who&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.340" end="00:38:00.310" style="s2">lurking in the bushes is is that even</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.570" end="00:38:02.080" style="s2">your 40-foot bill keeps getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.310" end="00:38:04.810" style="s2">outfitted with better and better</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.080" end="00:38:06.730" style="s2">technology right because as you know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.810" end="00:38:08.530" style="s2">fast our technology increases and so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.730" end="00:38:10.150" style="s2">can have the same size boat that you had</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.530" end="00:38:12.580" style="s2">10 years ago and the things like ten</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.150" end="00:38:14.050" style="s2">times as deadly as it was because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.580" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">know you&#39;re outfitted with the latest</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.050" end="00:38:18.030" style="s2">gear and you can understand why the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:20.710" style="s2">fishermen are driven to that but and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.030" end="00:38:23.170" style="s2">it&#39;s another structural problem that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.710" end="00:38:26.440" style="s2">that adds to this general overall</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.170" end="00:38:28.210" style="s2">problem the use of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.440" end="00:38:31.420" style="s2">space-age technology has had a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.210" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">catastrophic consequence too so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.420" end="00:38:36.010" style="s2">doing something they call let&#39;s see I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">gonna yeah fishing down the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.010" end="00:38:40.180" style="s2">so the way the food chains are set up is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:41.500" style="s2">there&#39;s like you know plankton at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.180" end="00:38:42.820" style="s2">bottom and they eat whatever they can</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.500" end="00:38:44.500" style="s2">get their little hands on and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.820" end="00:38:47.020" style="s2">often not you don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.500" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">handsome you know they also use</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.020" end="00:38:49.840" style="s2">photosynthesis and there&#39;s there at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:51.460" style="s2">bottom of the food chain there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.840" end="00:38:53.230" style="s2">billions of the things being whales eat</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.460" end="00:38:54.760" style="s2">them some whales and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.230" end="00:38:56.470" style="s2">little fish eat those and then bigger</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:38:56.770" style="s2">fish eat the little fish and bigger fish</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.470" end="00:38:58.600" style="s2">eat</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.770" end="00:39:00.220" style="s2">you know the medium-sized fish and so on</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.600" end="00:39:03.370" style="s2">all the way up to things like sharps and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:05.380" style="s2">swordfish and tuna and human beings now</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.370" end="00:39:07.210" style="s2">what we&#39;re basically doing we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.380" end="00:39:10.450" style="s2">like the fish that are higher up on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.210" end="00:39:12.190" style="s2">on the food chain so we tend to like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.450" end="00:39:15.370" style="s2">taste of predatory fish because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.190" end="00:39:17.230" style="s2">hard muscled and now the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.370" end="00:39:18.910" style="s2">that is that the higher you are you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.230" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">up in the food chain the fewer there can</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.910" end="00:39:23.020" style="s2">be of you in part because you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:24.900" style="s2">you&#39;re your primary sources of food are</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.020" end="00:39:27.700" style="s2">limited by this by this pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.900" end="00:39:29.800" style="s2">phenomena as we&#39;ve got better and better</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.700" end="00:39:31.720" style="s2">from a technological perspective at</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.800" end="00:39:34.060" style="s2">catching fish what&#39;s happened is we keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.720" end="00:39:36.280" style="s2">we are fishing down the food chain we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.060" end="00:39:39.490" style="s2">from the great big fish at the top like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.280" end="00:39:41.380" style="s2">the Sharks about 70 million a year of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.490" end="00:39:43.150" style="s2">which right now are killed for shark fin</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.380" end="00:39:45.370" style="s2">soup and that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of sharks</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">seventy million a year you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.370" end="00:39:48.490" style="s2">going to run out of sharks in no time</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:51.370" style="s2">flat if we keep things up at that rate</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.490" end="00:39:53.050" style="s2">and so we fish down the food chain we</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.370" end="00:39:54.610" style="s2">take the big predators first and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.050" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">the most valuable fish and then we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.610" end="00:39:58.630" style="s2">after what they go after and then we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">after what that fish is going after and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.630" end="00:40:01.930" style="s2">we go out farther Rafi</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.400" style="s2">when we go out into the deep ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.930" end="00:40:05.740" style="s2">we find places that no one&#39;s fished</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.400" end="00:40:08.349" style="s2">before but were so damn good at it now</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.740" end="00:40:10.539" style="s2">that the time to exhaustion of the new</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.349" end="00:40:13.240" style="s2">fish species from the time we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.539" end="00:40:15.490" style="s2">is about 15 years so we can discover a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.240" end="00:40:17.079" style="s2">new species which is often given even if</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.490" end="00:40:19.539" style="s2">it&#39;s half inedible it&#39;s given a real</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.079" end="00:40:21.609" style="s2">marketable name we go after it was face</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.539" end="00:40:24.099" style="s2">age technology and wipe it down to more</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.609" end="00:40:26.680" style="s2">than a - less than 85% of its previous</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.099" end="00:40:29.170" style="s2">numbers within 15 years we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.680" end="00:40:30.789" style="s2">deadly and so you know as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.170" end="00:40:33.039" style="s2">discover something plus there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.789" end="00:40:39.910" style="s2">of us that the things in serious trouble</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.039" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">in pretty much no time flat there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.910" end="00:40:45.160" style="s2">there has been a global decline in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:47.289" style="s2">world&#39;s catch ever since about 1998 if</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.160" end="00:40:49.150" style="s2">you control for red China&#39;s data because</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.130" end="00:41:04.210" style="s2">pretty damn good at that we haven&#39;t been</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.950" end="00:41:09.849" style="s2">technology has improved a lot we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.660" end="00:41:11.500" style="s2">going after other species and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.849" end="00:41:13.450" style="s2">a good thing and the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.500" end="00:41:14.980" style="s2">really worth noting about fish and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.450" end="00:41:17.049" style="s2">is one of the things that convinced me</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.980" end="00:41:19.390" style="s2">that there really was a problem was you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.049" end="00:41:22.450" style="s2">guys might know about the bet that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:24.220" style="s2">made by a Stanford biologist Paul</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.450" end="00:41:27.400" style="s2">Ehrlich and an economist whose name I</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.220" end="00:41:28.900" style="s2">don&#39;t remember in about 1968 and Paul</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.400" end="00:41:30.700" style="s2">Ehrlich had written this book called the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.900" end="00:41:31.960" style="s2">Population Bomb where he predicted that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.700" end="00:41:34.059" style="s2">you know we were all going to starve to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.960" end="00:41:36.339" style="s2">death by the year 2000 and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.059" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">economists always disagree with the</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.809" style="s2">been you know reasonably right the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.069" end="00:41:49.029" style="s2">biologists say well it&#39;s just a time</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.029" end="00:41:54.520" style="s2">eventually and who knows but this</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.430" end="00:41:57.130" style="s2">economists bet Eric that by the year</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.520" end="00:41:59.289" style="s2">2000 commodity prices would have gone</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.130" end="00:42:01.270" style="s2">down instead of up because Eric&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.289" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">was everything&#39;s getting scarce so from</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:05.260" style="s2">1968 to the year 2000 all our</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">commodities which are somewhat scarce</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.260" end="00:42:09.339" style="s2">are going to increase in price</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.339" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">prices plummeted between 1968 mm so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.549" end="00:42:15.880" style="s2">economists had</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:19.240" style="s2">you know had beat them in no uncertain</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.240" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">out that way is seafood I mean things</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.820" end="00:42:25.690" style="s2">like cod used to be cheap right seafood</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:27.070" style="s2">used to be cheap fish and chips that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.690" end="00:42:29.010" style="s2">the cheapest thing you could buy on the</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.010" end="00:42:33.400" style="s2">seafood is expensive and you know bloody</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.780" end="00:42:35.080" style="s2">well when something gets expensive that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.400" end="00:42:38.860" style="s2">there actually isn&#39;t that much of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.080" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s a really good marker so you</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.230" end="00:43:15.640" style="s2">when you read about them and trawling is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.240" end="00:43:22.270" style="s2">one of them and here here&#39;s a nice</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.640" end="00:43:24.370" style="s2">description of trolling basically what a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.270" end="00:43:27.340" style="s2">trawl does is this a huge net that&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.370" end="00:43:30.130" style="s2">behind a really big boat and the net is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.340" end="00:43:31.420" style="s2">weighted down and has rollers there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.130" end="00:43:33.400" style="s2">bunch of different kinds of them it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.420" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2">rollers and you put it on the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.400" end="00:43:37.060" style="s2">the ocean it sort of digs down to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:39.160" style="s2">depth of about eight inches and then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.060" end="00:43:41.140" style="s2">just drag the thing and you drag it till</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.160" end="00:43:44.460" style="s2">the net fills up and well what does it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.140" end="00:43:48.580" style="s2">fill up with well whatever&#39;s down there</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.460" end="00:43:50.110" style="s2">coral so especially now that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.580" end="00:43:52.360" style="s2">fishing out the deeper areas of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.110" end="00:43:54.100" style="s2">ocean all the corals coming up 300 pound</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.360" end="00:43:56.680" style="s2">chunks of it maybe they figure it takes</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.100" end="00:43:59.110" style="s2">10,000 years to grow and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.680" end="00:44:00.970" style="s2">habitat for for fish you run on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.110" end="00:44:02.770" style="s2">trawler over an area there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.970" end="00:44:05.110" style="s2">left of it it takes everything you haul</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.770" end="00:44:07.120" style="s2">it up what happens you take you ten</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.110" end="00:44:08.620" style="s2">percent of the damn fish that&#39;s in there</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.120" end="00:44:10.300" style="s2">that you want to eat you throw 90</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.620" end="00:44:14.140" style="s2">percent back because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.300" end="00:44:17.050" style="s2">have to do by law so the bycatch so to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.140" end="00:44:19.900" style="s2">speak which is what you don&#39;t want is 90</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.050" end="00:44:21.790" style="s2">percent back it goes into the water now</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.900" end="00:44:23.410" style="s2">remember I showed you the continental</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.790" end="00:44:25.960" style="s2">shelf there&#39;s not that much of it what</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.410" end="00:44:26.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve trolled most of it so when that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.960" end="00:44:28.180" style="s2">isn&#39;t stopped</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.740" end="00:44:29.740" style="s2">the trawlers are getting bigger there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.180" end="00:44:31.270" style="s2">something they called a super trawler</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.740" end="00:44:33.490" style="s2">that was heading down to Australia</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.270" end="00:44:34.900" style="s2">despite a lot of you know public outcry</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.490" end="00:44:36.849" style="s2">because the Australians are fairly</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.900" end="00:44:38.410" style="s2">sensitive about this sort of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.849" end="00:44:40.119" style="s2">know they&#39;re bigger and bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.410" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">bigger all the time and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.119" end="00:44:43.570" style="s2">because they&#39;re you know because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:45.880" style="s2">can and partly because they&#39;re chasing a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.570" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">diminishing resource so you imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.880" end="00:44:48.849" style="s2">would happen if you you know went</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">through a you know a nice bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.849" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">grassland or a national park with a net</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:56.260" style="s2">300 feet high and it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:59.349" style="s2">dragged through by tractors you just</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.260" end="00:45:02.260" style="s2">take everything trees deer moose birds</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.349" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">insects everything pull out the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.260" end="00:45:06.700" style="s2">you can eat let everything else rot</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:08.830" style="s2">Jesus if it was happening on land people</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.700" end="00:45:10.599" style="s2">would be shorting out and running around</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.830" end="00:45:12.010" style="s2">in circles screaming but it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.599" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">on you at the bottom of the ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.010" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">no-one can see it and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.250" style="s2">happening once there&#39;s lots of places in</p>

<p begin="00:45:18.250" end="00:45:22.690" style="s2">is no longer clear it&#39;s muddy because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.890" end="00:45:24.339" style="s2">the trawling at least in part because of</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.339" end="00:45:30.190" style="s2">place has been trolled like three or</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.190" end="00:45:33.880" style="s2">not going to work for very long</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:36.430" style="s2">so here&#39;s there here&#39;s the description</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.860" end="00:47:00.080" style="s2">distressing they estimate about 25</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.080" end="00:47:05.720" style="s2">hauled in by trawls so that just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.980" end="00:47:07.820" style="s2">seem like a particularly intelligent way</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.720" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">of going about things now because the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.820" end="00:47:11.120" style="s2">whole shelf is being trialed and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:12.380" style="s2">not a hell of a lot left there they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.120" end="00:47:15.290" style="s2">developed trials that can go down to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.380" end="00:47:16.730" style="s2">2,000 meters and 2,000 meters you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.290" end="00:47:19.940" style="s2">that&#39;s getting to be a mile and a half</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.730" end="00:47:21.590" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s close to the average depth</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.940" end="00:47:23.330" style="s2">of the deepest part of the ocean now</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.590" end="00:47:25.460" style="s2">when you go way down in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.330" end="00:47:27.140" style="s2">there&#39;s no a lot there as I said but</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.460" end="00:47:29.180" style="s2">there are places of the ocean floor that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.140" end="00:47:31.460" style="s2">are seem out so they sort of poke up and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.180" end="00:47:33.740" style="s2">when they poke up currents come up them</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.460" end="00:47:35.390" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of food on the sea</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.740" end="00:47:36.890" style="s2">mount areas and they can map those out</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.390" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">really nicely down with the deep sea</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.890" end="00:47:40.820" style="s2">trials they just go to the sea mounts</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:43.940" style="s2">and take everything that&#39;s there so a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.820" end="00:47:45.320" style="s2">purse scenes are also pretty devastating</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.940" end="00:47:47.330" style="s2">especially when you combine them with</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.320" end="00:47:49.100" style="s2">spawning airplanes because the spawning</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.330" end="00:47:50.990" style="s2">airplanes go off the coast too they find</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.100" end="00:47:52.760" style="s2">a you know a school and then the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.990" end="00:47:56.360" style="s2">the Saints come in and they take the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.760" end="00:47:59.660" style="s2">whole school so you know that&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.360" end="00:48:02.470" style="s2">really particularly a promising thing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.660" end="00:48:05.150" style="s2">be happening so then the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.470" end="00:48:09.500" style="s2">problematic form of fishing seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.150" end="00:48:11.150" style="s2">maybe longline fishing and so long lines</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.500" end="00:48:13.310" style="s2">are pretty much exactly that they sound</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.150" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">like they&#39;re very long fishing lines and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.310" end="00:48:19.160" style="s2">very long leads up to 40 miles long and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:22.430" style="s2">with 30 hooks per mile and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.160" end="00:48:24.050" style="s2">1,200 hooks and so you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.430" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">often catching the kind of fish that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.050" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">you&#39;d like to eat but they catch a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:29.720" style="s2">of other things too like tens of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:32.030" style="s2">thousands of seabirds and tens of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.720" end="00:48:33.560" style="s2">thousands of turtles and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.030" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">things and sharks and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.560" end="00:48:37.970" style="s2">things that you know will eat anything</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:39.620" style="s2">that&#39;s on a baited hook so the bycatch</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.970" end="00:48:43.700" style="s2">problem with longline fishing is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.620" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">horrendous so that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.700" end="00:48:50.360" style="s2">of you know miserable to our hand as</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:51.470" style="s2">well and then you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.360" end="00:48:53.870" style="s2">thing I mentioned a little bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.470" end="00:48:54.320" style="s2">about the Manhattan and that stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.870" end="00:48:56.780" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.320" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">distressing book to read because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.780" end="00:49:01.100" style="s2">the Manhattan because they&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">bottom of the food chain down you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.100" end="00:49:05.090" style="s2">down down near where the little fish are</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:07.280" style="s2">there oh and Men hadn&#39;t interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.090" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">enough our vegetarian most fish aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.280" end="00:49:10.760" style="s2">vegetarian but these guys are vegetarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:12.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s what puts them at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.760" end="00:49:14.600" style="s2">of the food chain they also take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.680" end="00:49:16.070" style="s2">of garbage out of the water because</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.600" end="00:49:17.750" style="s2">they&#39;re vegetarian and so if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.070" end="00:49:19.940" style="s2">algal blooms or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.750" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">which there often is because of nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.940" end="00:49:23.060" style="s2">runoff from fertilizers from the land</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:24.950" style="s2">that the Manhattan will go in there and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.060" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">clean it up and then all the other fish</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.950" end="00:49:28.250" style="s2">will eat them but they take the men out</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">now to turn them into fertilizer and as</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.250" end="00:49:32.180" style="s2">I said already you know that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">served at least in part by corruption in</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.180" end="00:49:36.470" style="s2">the East Coast states they do the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:38.030" style="s2">thing in Denmark with this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.470" end="00:49:39.830" style="s2">the sand eel and it&#39;s another one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.030" end="00:49:41.480" style="s2">these ugly little things that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.830" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">people wouldn&#39;t normally eat but</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.480" end="00:49:45.650" style="s2">everything else does and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:48.170" style="s2">of them they&#39;re sort of like the men hot</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.650" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">and they breed like mad but they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.170" end="00:49:54.250" style="s2">catching them catching those up a storm</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:54.250" style="s2">do it and often burning them for oil so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.490" end="00:49:59.720" style="s2">well and then there&#39;s oxido Canada</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.230" end="00:50:01.670" style="s2">Canada is by no means an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.720" end="00:50:03.950" style="s2">paradise like we like to pride ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:06.140" style="s2">on the idea that you know we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.950" end="00:50:07.580" style="s2">sort of great north with our massive</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.140" end="00:50:10.250" style="s2">forests and our care for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.580" end="00:50:13.850" style="s2">most that&#39;s pretty much rubbish so for</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.250" end="00:50:16.370" style="s2">example we have a far a smaller portion</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.850" end="00:50:18.380" style="s2">of our territory devoted to national</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.370" end="00:50:20.510" style="s2">parks than the Americans do despite the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.380" end="00:50:22.730" style="s2">fact that what 95 percent of the country</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.510" end="00:50:24.500" style="s2">is basically uninhabited so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.730" end="00:50:26.300" style="s2">pretty shocking statistic and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.500" end="00:50:28.700" style="s2">Americans have done a much better job of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.300" end="00:50:30.520" style="s2">managing their fisheries than us and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.700" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">know we should have been shocked into</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.520" end="00:50:38.810" style="s2">what embarrassed action in 1992 when</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:40.490" style="s2">this happened so you know the cod</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.810" end="00:50:42.500" style="s2">fishery off the Grand Banks had been</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.490" end="00:50:45.110" style="s2">there for 400 years and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.500" end="00:50:52.940" style="s2">one of the world&#39;s remarkable treasures</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.110" end="00:50:54.890" style="s2">and around before I guess 1978 the limit</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.940" end="00:50:57.170" style="s2">national sovereignty I think was seven</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.890" end="00:50:59.090" style="s2">miles it&#39;s four or seven miles I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.170" end="00:51:00.950" style="s2">remember exactly what and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.090" end="00:51:03.350" style="s2">Spaniards Spaniards and the Portuguese</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.950" end="00:51:05.500" style="s2">and and lots of European fishing boats</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.350" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">were in the Grand Banks fishing like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.500" end="00:51:09.730" style="s2">which of course they&#39;ve been doing for</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">really almost 600 years the Basques</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.730" end="00:51:13.030" style="s2">might have even got there before</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:15.160" style="s2">Christopher Columbus and not told</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.030" end="00:51:16.869" style="s2">anybody because they&#39;d like to have all</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.160" end="00:51:20.109" style="s2">those fish you know and Basques they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.869" end="00:51:22.119" style="s2">pretty sneaky people so anyways you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.109" end="00:51:23.619" style="s2">so the Canadian government made a big</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.119" end="00:51:25.869" style="s2">fuss about the fact that all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.619" end="00:51:27.550" style="s2">foreigners were out there taking out the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.869" end="00:51:30.220" style="s2">cod and they were part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.550" end="00:51:32.859" style="s2">political force that got the national</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.220" end="00:51:36.040" style="s2">sovereignty zone extended to 200 miles</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.859" end="00:51:38.230" style="s2">offshore so the candidate had managed</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.040" end="00:51:40.359" style="s2">its own cod stocks and of course we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.230" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">it responsibly well the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.359" end="00:51:43.510" style="s2">happened was the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.790" style="s2">modernized the Newfoundland fishing</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.510" end="00:51:48.040" style="s2">fleet and equipped it with you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.790" end="00:51:49.869" style="s2">really outstanding boats and the second</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.040" end="00:51:52.540" style="s2">thing that happened was we took all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.869" end="00:51:56.710" style="s2">fish and so by net one you see what</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.540" end="00:51:58.660" style="s2">happened by basically by 1992 so two</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.710" end="00:52:00.340" style="s2">billion fish that&#39;s the estimate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.660" end="00:52:02.980" style="s2">a lot of fish equal and weight to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.340" end="00:52:05.080" style="s2">entire Canadian population and these</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.980" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">caught man they were magnificent animals</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.080" end="00:52:09.099" style="s2">they figured the ones that were there</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:10.750" style="s2">when the Europeans first came over to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.099" end="00:52:12.910" style="s2">North America or something like five</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.750" end="00:52:14.320" style="s2">feet late in length more or less on</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.910" end="00:52:16.630" style="s2">average and teeth three feet around</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.320" end="00:52:18.730" style="s2">these were big fish you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.630" end="00:52:21.550" style="s2">both the size of a person and they came</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.730" end="00:52:23.230" style="s2">in massive massive schools and no one</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.550" end="00:52:26.770" style="s2">really knows why they haven&#39;t come back</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.230" end="00:52:30.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple hypotheses one is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.770" end="00:52:32.970" style="s2">know fish in schools are like zebras you</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.550" end="00:52:35.859" style="s2">don&#39;t see zebras lone zebras rain</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.970" end="00:52:37.869" style="s2">roaming the Serengeti you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.859" end="00:52:39.940" style="s2">see is big clumps of zebras because</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.869" end="00:52:42.010" style="s2">they&#39;re herd animals and they really are</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.940" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">herd animals which means the herd is</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.010" end="00:52:46.900" style="s2">their environment and so they can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">away from a herd more any less than</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.900" end="00:52:51.310" style="s2">people can and it looks like COD or sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:54.490" style="s2">of like that another fish that live in</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.310" end="00:52:56.380" style="s2">schools so for example one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.490" end="00:52:58.690" style="s2">that happens with Cod schools is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.380" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">first of all there&#39;s a lot of subspecies</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.690" end="00:53:02.290" style="s2">of cod and we don&#39;t know how old the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:05.589" style="s2">schools are but some of the schools</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.290" end="00:53:08.020" style="s2">might be who knows 150,000 years old as</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.589" end="00:53:10.150" style="s2">superorganism and they seem to actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.020" end="00:53:12.609" style="s2">kind of know the ocean in which they</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.150" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2">swim as a collective unit and so they</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.609" end="00:53:15.730" style="s2">know where to go eat and they know where</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:18.010" style="s2">you know they they know their habitat</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.730" end="00:53:18.970" style="s2">and more importantly the cod range</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.010" end="00:53:20.769" style="s2">themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.970" end="00:53:22.869" style="s2">so that the big Carter in the middle and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.769" end="00:53:24.460" style="s2">the little Carter sort of outside and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.869" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">then the Predators pick off the little</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.460" end="00:53:28.539" style="s2">Cod but they&#39;re useless anyways because</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:30.279" style="s2">they&#39;re too young to breed so the school</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.539" end="00:53:33.130" style="s2">is structured so that the big Carter</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.279" end="00:53:35.710" style="s2">protective second when the card mate</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.130" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">they actually use the school as a mating</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.710" end="00:53:39.970" style="s2">structure so they organize the mating</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:41.829" style="s2">routines on the outside of the school</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.970" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2">structure and so what that implies is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.829" end="00:53:45.970" style="s2">that if you blow out the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">the school then the Kahn don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.970" end="00:53:49.660" style="s2">to do and that&#39;s one potential reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:52.390" style="s2">they haven&#39;t really managed to come back</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.660" end="00:53:54.609" style="s2">there&#39;s others one being perhaps that if</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.390" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">you really devastate a population then</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.609" end="00:53:58.900" style="s2">maybe you change the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:01.509" style="s2">conditions of the environment because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.900" end="00:54:03.880" style="s2">turns out that the way an ecosystem sets</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.509" end="00:54:06.309" style="s2">itself up is dependent to some degree on</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.880" end="00:54:08.259" style="s2">which creature gets there first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.309" end="00:54:10.660" style="s2">which creature gets there in what order</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.259" end="00:54:13.299" style="s2">and so if you wipe population like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.660" end="00:54:14.980" style="s2">card out low enough then other animals</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.299" end="00:54:16.839" style="s2">move in to get the niche and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.980" end="00:54:18.609" style="s2">the card can&#39;t come back now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.839" end="00:54:20.289" style="s2">other theories too you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.609" end="00:54:23.589" style="s2">which have to do with ocean warming but</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.289" end="00:54:25.869" style="s2">the point is we&#39;ve left the card alone</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.589" end="00:54:27.759" style="s2">kind of because people are still allowed</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.869" end="00:54:28.210" style="s2">to fish a lot more for Cod than you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.759" end="00:54:30.099" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.210" end="00:54:32.369" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of left them alone for 20</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.099" end="00:54:35.079" style="s2">years and the consequence has been</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.369" end="00:54:36.730" style="s2">pretty minimal especially for an animal</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.079" end="00:54:39.849" style="s2">that you know fish they lay a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.730" end="00:54:41.740" style="s2">eggs it&#39;s not like they&#39;re it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.849" end="00:54:45.220" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not able to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.740" end="00:54:46.539" style="s2">they certainly know how to do that so so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.220" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">you know you think we might learn</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.539" end="00:54:50.140" style="s2">something from this but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:52.089" style="s2">really appear that we did and the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.140" end="00:54:54.490" style="s2">thing that really struck me is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.089" end="00:54:56.769" style="s2">mind-boggling when I was going through</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.490" end="00:54:59.140" style="s2">this material was exactly Canada&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.769" end="00:55:02.440" style="s2">record which was so embarrassing that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.140" end="00:55:05.319" style="s2">was again it was like a personal blow so</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.440" end="00:55:07.809" style="s2">in 1910 I&#39;m going to pretty much fold up</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.319" end="00:55:10.769" style="s2">with this in 1992 which was about when</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.809" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">the cod fishery collapsed Canada</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.769" end="00:55:17.079" style="s2">promised to protect 20% of its oceanic</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:19.779" style="s2">territory so the idea was to put aside</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.079" end="00:55:21.700" style="s2">chunks of oceanic territory sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.779" end="00:55:23.380" style="s2">national parks you know where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.700" end="00:55:25.779" style="s2">animals that live there in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.380" end="00:55:27.609" style="s2">ecosystems would be protected so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.779" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">they could come back because you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.609" end="00:55:31.530" style="s2">fish come back pretty fast if you leave</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:34.440" style="s2">them alone I read something very</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.530" end="00:55:36.330" style="s2">think about this very fact um you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.440" end="00:55:38.190" style="s2">how you heard and maybe this is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.330" end="00:55:41.300" style="s2">but I read it several places you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.190" end="00:55:44.490" style="s2">how you heard that the whole Gulf of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.300" end="00:55:46.920" style="s2">Mexico oil spill was such a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.490" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">for fish yeah well there were more fish</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.920" end="00:55:50.820" style="s2">the year after this filled in the year</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:53.400" style="s2">before and the reason for that is no one</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.820" end="00:55:55.470" style="s2">fished so that&#39;s you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.400" end="00:55:57.480" style="s2">pretty peculiar statistic but it shows</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.470" end="00:56:00.030" style="s2">you two things a how many fish we take</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.480" end="00:56:01.770" style="s2">and B how damn fast the fish can come</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.030" end="00:56:03.300" style="s2">back if you leave them alone the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.770" end="00:56:05.310" style="s2">thing happened in the North Sea in World</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.300" end="00:56:06.900" style="s2">War two was pretty much fished out</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.310" end="00:56:09.150" style="s2">before World War two but no one was</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.900" end="00:56:10.800" style="s2">fishing during World War two because of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.150" end="00:56:12.630" style="s2">German u-boats and there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.800" end="00:56:14.700" style="s2">fish in the North Sea again after World</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.630" end="00:56:16.950" style="s2">War two so if you leave the things alone</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.700" end="00:56:20.070" style="s2">for a while they can come back Canada</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.950" end="00:56:23.910" style="s2">promised to protect at least 20% of its</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.070" end="00:56:26.910" style="s2">oceanic territory by 2012 in writing in</p>

<p begin="00:56:55.500" end="00:56:58.800" style="s2">need is you need to set aside a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.270" end="00:57:00.120" style="s2">protected area that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.800" end="00:57:02.550" style="s2">representative of all these different</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.120" end="00:57:06.420" style="s2">ecological zones and we have plenty of</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.250" end="00:57:18.930" style="s2">of the great cod catastrophe looks to me</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.830" end="00:57:22.020" style="s2">to be pretty much absolutely nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.930" end="00:57:23.760" style="s2">what&#39;s weird about that and at least in</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.020" end="00:57:26.520" style="s2">part I mean Canada is a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.760" end="00:57:29.220" style="s2">place but the Australians have actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.520" end="00:57:31.800" style="s2">protected 20% of their oceanic area and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.220" end="00:57:33.930" style="s2">have promised 20% more recently and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.800" end="00:57:37.290" style="s2">actually seem to mean it which is about</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.930" end="00:57:39.930" style="s2">a third as much territory as Australia</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.290" end="00:57:42.390" style="s2">actually has so it is actually possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.930" end="00:57:45.029" style="s2">to set aside what are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.390" end="00:57:47.549" style="s2">national parks in the in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.029" end="00:57:49.409" style="s2">and let the damn fish come back and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.549" end="00:57:50.819" style="s2">principle at least that would also be</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.409" end="00:57:52.679" style="s2">good for the fishermen because they can</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.819" end="00:57:54.269" style="s2">hang around the edges of the parks and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.679" end="00:57:56.159" style="s2">you know the fish don&#39;t know where the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.269" end="00:57:57.390" style="s2">boundaries are they can scoop them up</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.159" end="00:58:01.019" style="s2">once they breed again</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.390" end="00:58:04.229" style="s2">so it&#39;s a rather cataclysmic and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.019" end="00:58:07.469" style="s2">staggering saga of insane mismanagement</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.229" end="00:58:09.269" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s not there&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.469" end="00:58:11.999" style="s2">point pointing the finger one place or</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.269" end="00:58:14.699" style="s2">another because you know it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.999" end="00:58:16.919" style="s2">much everybody&#39;s fault but it sure seems</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.699" end="00:58:20.519" style="s2">to me to be one of those things that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.919" end="00:58:24.119" style="s2">got to think about as being uh it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.519" end="00:58:26.759" style="s2">it&#39;s hauntingly foolish because all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.119" end="00:58:29.819" style="s2">that could be there why wouldn&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.759" end="00:58:32.069" style="s2">a good thing and you know if there was</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.819" end="00:58:33.329" style="s2">the political will in Canada it could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.069" end="00:58:35.759" style="s2">done because other countries have done</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.329" end="00:58:38.309" style="s2">it and for some reason this is just not</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.759" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">and on the radar issue even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.309" end="00:58:42.809" style="s2">a real issue this is actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:45.390" style="s2">it&#39;s really not good it&#39;s happening a</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.809" end="00:58:46.979" style="s2">lot it&#39;s going to get worse we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.390" end="00:58:49.469" style="s2">going to have a lot of fish to eat the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.979" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">oceans are going to be a pretty barren</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.469" end="00:58:59.419" style="s2">and dismal place and we can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:59:01.859" style="s2">something about it so so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.419" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">decided to do this talk even though I</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.859" end="00:59:06.689" style="s2">don&#39;t really know a lot about the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:09.539" style="s2">you know it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.689" end="00:59:11.249" style="s2">situation is always dangerous talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.539" end="00:59:13.799" style="s2">about things when you sort of know</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.249" end="00:59:16.229" style="s2">something and mostly you don&#39;t but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.799" end="00:59:20.099" style="s2">seems to me that the situation with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.229" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">oceans is so obviously not good that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.099" end="00:59:26.279" style="s2">actually don&#39;t have to be an expert to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:28.109" style="s2">notice and so what can be done about it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.279" end="00:59:29.579" style="s2">well you know the only I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.109" end="00:59:32.279" style="s2">marine protected areas are a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.579" end="00:59:33.900" style="s2">and look you know that we have examples</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.279" end="00:59:36.539" style="s2">of countries doing it and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.900" end="00:59:38.429" style="s2">work everyone&#39;s already figured out that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.539" end="00:59:40.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty good idea with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.429" end="00:59:42.659" style="s2">national parks on land no one seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.679" end="00:59:44.789" style="s2">really dispute that although you know we</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.659" end="00:59:47.429" style="s2">could have some more national parks so</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.789" end="00:59:48.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the big problem about having them</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.429" end="00:59:50.810" style="s2">out in the ocean you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.800" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">preserve some of the coastline and to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.810" end="00:59:53.780" style="s2">let the fish have a fighting chance and</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">this we don&#39;t want to have them around</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.780" end="01:00:00.710" style="s2">you know and what we&#39;re facing in some</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="01:00:05.420" style="s2">ways well they&#39;re starting to process</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.710" end="01:00:07.700" style="s2">jellyfish for food because as we get rid</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.420" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">of the fish that the whole ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.700" end="01:00:13.850" style="s2">starts to turn back to what it was like</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:15.500" style="s2">400 million years ago before there were</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.850" end="01:00:17.990" style="s2">any fish and there were lots of</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.500" end="01:00:19.670" style="s2">invertebrates and you know we could have</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.990" end="01:00:22.040" style="s2">an ocean full of invertebrates and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.670" end="01:00:24.680" style="s2">hear they press up into hockey stick</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.040" end="01:00:27.050" style="s2">hockey puck sized discs pretty nicely</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.680" end="01:00:28.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a lot of taste and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.050" end="01:00:30.740" style="s2">suppose you&#39;d have to be a pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.460" end="01:00:32.900" style="s2">chef to make them edible but we probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.740" end="01:00:36.860" style="s2">won&#39;t run out of jellyfish during our</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.900" end="01:00:39.020" style="s2">life so I don&#39;t know maybe it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.860" end="01:00:41.990" style="s2">be a bad idea to pen a note to your MP</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.020" end="01:00:46.250" style="s2">or to the Minister of Fisheries or and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.990" end="01:00:50.020" style="s2">just note that you know destroying a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.250" end="01:00:54.260" style="s2">resource that we could actually enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.020" end="01:00:56.030" style="s2">aesthetically and practically that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.260" end="01:00:58.460" style="s2">destroying that seems to be not</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.030" end="01:01:00.110" style="s2">anybody&#39;s best interest and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.460" end="01:01:03.140" style="s2">actually happening at a pretty rapid</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.110" end="01:01:06.590" style="s2">rate so I guess that&#39;s partly what Finn</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.140" end="01:01:08.780" style="s2">is aiming out and partly why I decided</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.590" end="01:01:10.970" style="s2">to do this talk and also to get involved</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.780" end="01:01:12.890" style="s2">in to invite dr. Hansen who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.970" end="01:01:16.430" style="s2">who really knows what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.890" end="01:01:17.930" style="s2">who&#39;s going to speak next so we should</p>
