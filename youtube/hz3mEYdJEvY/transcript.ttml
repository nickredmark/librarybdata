<p begin="00:00:26.080" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">throughout we are going to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.080" style="s2">the hard problems of how we can give an</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.080" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">of a phenomenal like consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">the scientific worldview how we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">wrestle with that problem in conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">with the problem that greg calls the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">descriptive metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">by which it talks about mind and or</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">accounts of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">so i hope you&#39;ll join us throughout uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">last time uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">greg did this excellent thing where he</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">took sort of the philosophical problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">given to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">uh most prominently by descartes by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">cohort of other people galileo etc</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">and then he showed how that just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">unfolded through what he has aptly named</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">uh the problem of psychology and so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">we have what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">that the problem of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">enmeshed with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">the problem of of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">commitment to the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">and i neither greg nor i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">are anti-scientific that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">of what i just said what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:39.280" style="s2">show is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">descartes uh creation of what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.280" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">called the mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">body problem and that&#39;s what all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">arguments have shown was deeply enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">uh with the creation of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one problematic on one</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">side and then great</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">and these are not independent but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">following from that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">uh greg showed an important</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">specification of that problematic</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">in the problem of psychology which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">the discipline that is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">at least officially studying the mind um</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">can&#39;t get it [ __ ] together um in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">sense of giving us a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">picture that we could then bring into</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">how you know the formulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">problem what&#39;s the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">uh mind and matter and then greg and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">both acknowledge that that&#39;s now been</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">exacerbated by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">uh by the emergence of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">additional</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">um competing sciences of mind like</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">neuroscience and artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">uh and linguistics etc and so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">problematic situation greg i think very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">amen amen and i&#39;ll just say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">when we understand the emergence of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">happened as you articulated with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">modern science</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">revolution it was to the create the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">split between okay you have secondary</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a primary quantity quality</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:02:59.879" style="s2">out here</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">right and then we have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.879" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">epistemological change in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">empiricism really where it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">it&#39;s empiricism is what you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">like wait a minute we have to factor out</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">what you see and measure it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">from a third person perspective okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">and then if it&#39;s a third person</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">perspective but what we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">interested in is also a first person</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">well that&#39;s a real that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">epistemological problem right</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.879" style="s2">uh and i just happen to see a a uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">you know i scan actually all</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">intro psych texts that come across my</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">feed i have a feed so</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">and i just saw psychology for students</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">you know student-friendly version</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">and it just opens up it says oh what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">mind uh mind is all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">are really cool and then it just says</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">well you can&#39;t see it so we sell a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">psychologist to study it study</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">scientifically behavior right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">it does this whole thing here&#39;s mine and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">then all of a sudden you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">and then they say because it&#39;s science</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">it has to be behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">which is basically then saying because</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">we&#39;re in the epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">category of a third person view then</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">then we have to frame it this way</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">um right and and then they&#39;re off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">running is that well actually you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">really want to stop there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">make sure your problem formation is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">really clear make sure you don&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">equivocating on what mind is and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">behavior is and what you can see and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">what you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">and do any of that they just proceeded</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">that&#39;s to me the [ __ ] show um that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">that is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we&#39;re here doing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">thing to untangle the world not so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">exactly so thank you that was good</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">i like it when you when you get in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">rift mode i really like it um</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">so i want to return back greg to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">descartes because we&#39;ve largely had</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">what you might call a negative you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">what the problematic</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">the critical aspect and i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">done a lot to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">at least make it plausible that there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">issue of even formulating the problem in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">let alone which is why i tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">skeptical of people who just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">here&#39;s what consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">um and they do some video on it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">promote some argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">um not that they should be ignored i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">not promoting censorship but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">i think that you know unless this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">these this intersect inter</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">interpenetrating set of problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">is is addressed explicit is explicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">and formulated i think the chances of of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">uh making progress on the on tangling</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">the world not are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:23.039" style="s2">are very diminished uh 100 i mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">historical problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.039" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">the other thing i become very keen on is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">what&#39;s the epistemological dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">what&#39;s the ontological reference and are</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">you being clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">and if i hear somebody saying oh i saw</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">the problem of consciousness it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and they don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">ontology epistemology or historical</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.199" style="s2">grammar of whatever justification system</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.199" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">equivocating and confusing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s what your metaphor which</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">you&#39;ve drawn for wittgenstein</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">of all of these language games</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">that are not using the same sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">using different epistemological frames</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">having different ontological commitments</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">um is making this uh very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">indeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">and so yeah you get and and uh as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.319" style="s2">know i&#39;ve have a video out there about</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">you know how even the various completing</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">competing disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">all like you know neuroscience studies</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">the brain and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">uses this method and gathers this kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">of data and then psychology as you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">said doesn&#39;t know it claims to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">studying behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">it uses experimental method but blah</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">and then you got computer science that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">no we we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t study brain and we don&#39;t study</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">right we don&#39;t study behavior we make</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">machines that do information processing</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">all the methods are different all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">all the theoretical ontologies are</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">the language games are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">different so when people and they all</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">use the word mind and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">interchangeably but they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">about different things that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">we have to be very cognizant of that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">let&#39;s go very carefully so i want to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">to daycare and try and pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">something positive from descartes</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">amen i want to i want to remind</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">everybody of our first</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">uh session greg and i had where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">talked about how there&#39;s these two</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">fundamental problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">concerning consciousness and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">another place by the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">there&#39;s even sort of equivocation or um</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">negligence in the fact that often these</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">are brought up independently of each</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">other sometimes confused with each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">and this is the this is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">the generation problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">uh this is broadly speaking how does</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">the phenomena of mind emerge or</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:31.599" style="s2">come to be if i i&#39;ll use a less</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">contentious word</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.599" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">come to be in um the world as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">described by the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">and as i&#39;ll remind you one more time</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">this problem commits you to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">scientific worldview if you really want</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">to solve it because that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you have to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">scientific worldview unchallenged</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">but you can&#39;t ignore it or dismiss it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">amen</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s the nature or generation</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">and then there is the other problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">which is the function problem what is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">that consciousness does</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s a more pressing problem than</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">faced by descartes because</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">you know post freud onward and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">then chomsky and others</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">we have come to understand how much of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">our intelligent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">is carried out by unconscious processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">what is the special function that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">consciousness is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">to our intelligent behavior if any at</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">and of course you know and i know there</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">are some people who propose</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">that consciousness has no important</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">function it&#39;s almost a purely</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">epi-phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">entity now descartes does something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">interesting and i think it&#39;s instructive</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">he he doesn&#39;t solve these problems but</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">what he does is the way he formulates</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">them might be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">he formulates them in a way in which he</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">tries to address</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">the function and the nature problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">and i would argue that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">a very very good strategy to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">so what i want to do with you greg is</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">take a look at go ahead sorry i was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">did uh you are so much more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">with descartes than i am in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">depth of his thought and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">did he use this distinction was he</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">pretty clear on the function</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">nature distinction or you&#39;re just saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">that his intuition and his model</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">basically blend yeah but he wasn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">is the latter</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">very much the latter okay and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">i think the integration was so</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">intuitively apparent to him</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">that the distinction is one that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">anachronistically imposing on him</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">perfect okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">just want to be clear about that no of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">course excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">so let&#39;s start with the problematic a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">problem that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">uh faced and um and and unfold a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">the problematic around it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">so for reasons which we&#39;ve already sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">of indicated and i know you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">work on it so i&#39;ll give you a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">space to jive on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">uh but uh descartes had come to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">that only human beings had consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">uh he made that argument because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">their capacity for speech</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">interestingly notice he&#39;s kept he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">capturing an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">that we need addressed this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">that we attribute consciousness on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">basis of the complexity and flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">of creatures cognitive behavior right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">we actually think that intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">is some kind of important marker of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">even though we now know that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">intelligence is unconscious so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">why this is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">but that intuition is nevertheless the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">one we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">draw upon when we make our attributions</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">even today so if you ask people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">do you think a cat has consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">yeah yeah i think a cat has</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">what about a worm ah</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">yeah exactly unless you&#39;re pan psychos</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">and we&#39;ll come back to pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">later okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">now what that means is notice what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">relies on that intuition relies on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">the that the nature of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">the function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">are actually intimately related right</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:59.839" style="s2">because i can only attribute</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">consciousness to other things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">of how they&#39;re functioning</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">very broadly construed and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">that is of course i think a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">important intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to argue that it should</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">unless we can get an independent</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">argument for rejecting that intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">and given that that is the widespread</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">method by which everybody does the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">attribution of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">i think that intuition should be taken</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">seriously and that is one argument among</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:29.040" style="s2">many why the nature and the function</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">problems should be addressed together</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.040" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">yes okay so descartes goes in with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">he says only human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">consciousness and because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">now redefined the soul as consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">and all the problematic reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">um the catholic church sort of likes</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">that because there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">christian doctrine which i think might</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">be undergoing revision right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">um that only human beings have souls</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">animals don&#39;t have souls they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">have an afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:04.079" style="s2">so the descartes inherits</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">a problem that faced the christians and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.079" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">you can see this uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">in their some of their battles with some</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">of the pagan fosters well</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">given that animals don&#39;t have souls</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">maybe for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">in the aristotelian framework they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">they just have an animal soul they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">even plants have a vegetative soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">the soil is something much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">functional but let&#39;s say given that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">so descartes inherits the problem of yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">but animals clearly</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">are intelligent like a dog right they</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.320" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">can learn they can be trained they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">they navigate through the world they</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">protect themselves they protect their</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">like they seek out and hunt and find</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">food like this like trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">machine to do all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">like it&#39;s really really wickedly</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">difficult we don&#39;t have artificial</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s at that level now okay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">descartes has this problem of okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">if they don&#39;t have souls and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">consciousness why are they nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">capable of so much intelligence and see</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">how he&#39;s confronting the front</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:02.399" style="s2">seat greg it&#39;s not like i said it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">explicit but he&#39;s bumping into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.399" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">relationship between the nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">function right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">and by the way now i&#39;m also in my own</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">frame of psychology which lines up with</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">your cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">okay what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">the complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">functional adaptive behavior of animals</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">right and then we&#39;re saying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s mediating</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">that dynamic problem-solving adjustment</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">right yes yes and then that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">some sort of brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">intelligence cognition they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">to get done have cognition as a term</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">conscious something right is at least a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">mentalist</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">assertion so so that&#39;s that connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">just now we have an external view of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">world i.e a behavioral scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">and we can just watch what animals do</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">so uh maybe before we return to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">descartes maybe this is a good time i</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">know you just mentioned before we</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">started recording</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing you know you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">some review and study of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">you know the attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">consciousness to animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:03.199" style="s2">and you said there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">coming out about that right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.199" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">so we&#39;re the position if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">that the problem that descartes face is</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">even more pressing for us because</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">we are even much more aware and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">even harder for us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">not attribute consciousness to animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">but maybe i&#39;ve said too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">no no absolutely in fact now there&#39;s a i</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">think it was 2012</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">i could find the actual thing there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">a declaration of animal consciousness by</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">um ethologists and comparative</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">neuroscientists that were studying this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">issue and that says absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">there&#39;s some forms of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">the in the animal kingdom 100</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">or at least you know that&#39;s our strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">that&#39;s why we need to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">everybody knows that scientifically now</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">we believe descartes is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">that animals have an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">there is something that it is like to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">a bat um to use the nagel term</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">right and so i&#39;ll just make a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">interesting points at least in my own</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">just for reference so in terms of deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">consciousness like when does it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">get started</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">um there are some people uh jablanka if</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">i hope i say her name right there</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">uh and her colleagues uh the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:09.440" style="s2">of the sensitive soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">uh she they go back essentially to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">cambrian explosion</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">uh that&#39;s about 550 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s really the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">operant learning okay for them is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">is that that is the beginning of uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">experience and pleasure and pain and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">moving toward and moving away</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s pretty deep and if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">know 500 million years ago 550 million</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">and then other individuals are looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">to see that the shape</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">or contours or functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">consciousness so for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">like how much what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">perspectival perceptual awareness</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">as an entity have um some animals seem</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">to have a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">how much self almost self-awareness or</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">proto what i call proto-self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">or extension of intuitive self</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">elephants seem to have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">that kind of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">uh so there are some people that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">then starting to really map different</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">uh corresponding to functional responses</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">brain imagery then</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:07.920" style="s2">a whole set of assumptions kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">global neuronal workspace kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.920" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">assumptions that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">operative so it&#39;s it&#39;s really exciting i</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">think some of the work</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">thank you that is very cool so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">let&#39;s pick up on the first one</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s a theme running</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">throughout that the attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">seems to be paired with the attribution</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">of intelligence because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">getting operant learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">and some capacity for learning and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">problems it&#39;s very so just for people</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">are clear so classical learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">is like what a little reflex system will</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">do and it could become</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">habituated or sensitized to certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">kinds of stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">okay operant learning is when you get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">feedback loop on your consequences</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">yeah okay when you start doing stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">then you extract resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">then you draw your attention and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">investment in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s so much more fluid and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">okay and also it makes the creature well</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">more intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">well there it is and maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">conscious yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">exactly so uh within the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">community as greg has pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">about the attribution saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">exists uh in terms of its functionality</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">so again trying to keep the nature and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">the function problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">uh distinct i think is not an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">uh or sorry it&#39;s not a a strategy we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">should follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">i think decart&#39;s intuition um is is well</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">placed</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">okay so back to descartes and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">back to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">and which is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">he&#39;s facing the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">well let&#39;s say like dogs and then we</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">know he thinks dogs don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t have souls because he he</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:46.400" style="s2">justifies doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">you know vivisection on them where</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re still alive because</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">they they don&#39;t have consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">he&#39;s aware that dogs are highly</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">and so how does he explain his</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">intelligence well he brings up something</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">um and this is this goes to the work of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">my colleague at u of t</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">uh bill seeger in his book on</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">consciousness and so i recommend people</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">to take a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">uh because descartes has often been uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">we often are given a caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">descartes rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">an in-depth study and seeger takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">descartes seriously and takes what</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">descartes does seriously</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">so descartes says and very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">he says well</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">what animals have um and i&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">use some modern language because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">faster than</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">trying to his archaic language and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">translate it blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">so but basically what descartes says is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">well what</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">animals have is they have sort of brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">states that reliably covari</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">with things in the environment right</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">they reliably co-vary</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">uh so you know if some object comes in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">front of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a brain state and whenever that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">object is there that brain state and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">so they reliably covari and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">have a version of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">you know that&#39;s very prominent right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">with the whole predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">model okay so well placed</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">and also one of the one of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">standard presuppositions of most</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">models of what a representation is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve pointed out that psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">often don&#39;t even talk about what a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">representation is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">they just presuppose it but in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">science there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this deep question what</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">the heck is a representation right</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">and most models are versions of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">co-variation model</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">that for me to have a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">the world is for me to have some state</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">in here often my whole embodied</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">for recognition yeah yeah exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">let&#39;s just say some</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">some state in me that reliably covaries</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">right with the environment uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">and and then what descartes says is okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">and what that&#39;ll do is that&#39;ll allow the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">organism the ability to vary its</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">behavior the co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">variation mechanism yeah vary its</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">according to environmental conditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">and that will make the organism</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">behave in a in an intelligent fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">what is the organism not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">doing it&#39;s not capable of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">so what&#39;s going on there so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">here i&#39;m gonna help descartes out by</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">jumping ahead to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">uh the correct discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">representation so when you look and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">this is we can&#39;t do another whole series</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">on mental representation so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">i&#39;m just pointing out again how</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">challenging this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">and people often often use this term in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">a highly equivocal fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">okay but one of the problems that has</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">been brought up by cummins and others</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">about the co-variation theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a standard it&#39;s now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">consensus that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">genuine problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">if i have some object</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">right and discoveries the problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">co-variation</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">covaries with many things many different</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">possible mental representations</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">so if i have an apple in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">right this thing is covariate</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">covariating with an apple</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">it&#39;s co-varying with a fruit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">co-varying with food</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s co-varying with something in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">hand it&#39;s covering with an object that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:11.320" style="s2">can throw</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">right right and those mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.320" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">are much more distinct and specific than</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">the co-variation</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">right so representation has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">referential specificity</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">that covariation does not have right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">what that means</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">is it is irredeemably vague</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">in terms of its potential semantic</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">content so while it may be guiding and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">then you know quine also</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">made this famous with the gava guy</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of versions of this so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">this is a very uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">right pressing issue</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">and this also i think is an issue that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">needs to be taken up i&#39;m discussing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">mark miller in predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">yes but what is it you&#39;re predicting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s selecting</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">because all of these predictions come</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">true there&#39;s an apple there</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a fruit there there&#39;s food there</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s an object that i can throw there</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">there&#39;s the thing that the witch used to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">poison uh snow white there right</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">all of these predictions are coming true</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">but they&#39;re not all the same claim</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">because they have different semantic</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">content and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">descartes</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">sort of gets that&#39;s why he ties</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">consciousness to language because</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">language gives you the specificity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">i&#39;ll add just a little quick so from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">unified perspective i&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">the constraints then to make that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">going to be behavioral investment which</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">energy expenditure function like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">does this mean to me and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">so exactly connection between uh that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">object has affordances it has stressors</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">it has an investment relation</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to constrain some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">that and frame it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">in relation yes and i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">argue and i think you&#39;re in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s where notions of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">realization can be importantly brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">to bear</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">well that&#39;s a key ingredient that seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">to be missing</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">so descartes descartes seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard and it&#39;s you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">worried of the i&#39;m worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">anachronism by us</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">but you know seeger is also a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">careful reader</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">what daycare seems to think is that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">job of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">is to pick out to select from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">covariation</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">which aspect is to be made ready for</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:31.320" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">so the job of consciousness is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.320" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">aspectualize it&#39;s to pick out the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">aspect that is going to be made</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">ready for reasoning so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">evaluate it for the particular truth so</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">because reasoning cares with truth cares</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">about truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">right reasoning needs um co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">that have been aspectulized</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">and specified so their semantic content</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">is specifiable enough that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">evaluated</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">so he has he has this role for</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">consciousness but consciousness does</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">is right when you when right the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">are are something you sort of uh see</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">you aspectualize them yes and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">how you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">and so consciousness if this is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">a slogan but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">mnemonically helpful consciousness turns</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">into representation through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really powerful and brilliant yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">so i&#39;ll come back to what descartes says</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">about it oh go ahead please</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">so let&#39;s uh so again i&#39;ll make another</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">reference okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">when i&#39;m looking at this issue i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">looking at it from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">in the evolutionary history of animal</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:45.919" style="s2">consciousness yeah yes yes right</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m also then looking at sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.919" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">from the top if you want to use that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">uh the tree of knowledge helps me</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">justify that verdict</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">and angle and then i want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">the unique uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">secondary layer of consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">human yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">and you when i was listening to this one</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">in the meaning uh crisis i think you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">used this term ready for reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">a bit or at least in the other times and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">man did a light bulb go off okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">because justification systems yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">says that language and then reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">means that you now have to give an</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">account okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">and that means that you do at a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">self-conscious level not at a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">phenomenological perspectival level but</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">at a self-conscious level there is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">whole problem of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">ready for reason so you can justify</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">right so so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">seeing that descartes saw that as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">you know and then saw that as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">mechanism it&#39;s sort of like he&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">part of consciousness right but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">actually really honing into the second</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">part of consciousness you know that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">can see and then remember that connects</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">directly to what freud ends up seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">terms of oh there&#39;s an animal</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">consciousness beneath</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">and this is how the ego is a mental</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">organ of justification so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">of intersections</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">and and i didn&#39;t understand descartes</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">nearly as well as you did so that made</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">first heard it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">now that you say that uh that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">me think of something because</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:07.039" style="s2">uh you know when we did the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">reason we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">inherently</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">social cultural nature of reason and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">your work on the justification system</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">and then later work</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">that is converging with your work by</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">sperver and most gay people like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">how reason is ultimately is mostly done</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">and mostly should be done</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">in distributed cognition dialogue it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a dialogical function that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">in nature it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">abstraction function it&#39;s a dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">function right</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">so given that descartes has the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">monological model of mind right he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">right he can&#39;t actually he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">the sociocultural level of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">and he&#39;s then dominated by the modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">science which which gives pristine</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">um place of analytic reasoning and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">he has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">this is this has to be the highest</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">function analytical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">and he misses the whole social pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">dimension that would have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">uh prior to these higher order</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">and is always needed even when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">doing the hospital always needed</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">that comes later um not you know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">obviously really is a psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">invention essentially of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">of cultural evolutionary justification</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">i agree so i just wanted to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">up because it&#39;s another way in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">right the individualistic monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">self-imposed misses</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">modernist yeah neoliberal modern is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">to get into that but yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">that is one of the corrections as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">transformation from hyper individualism</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">into a much more uh networked uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">systemic and social</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">conception okay that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">so the but the readiness for reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">is going to come back when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">like global work space and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">descartes has a and you know and also</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">you know block and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">ties notion of poisonous and access</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">so descartes i think there&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">precursor there</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">but i want to get up on the this issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">of aspectualization because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">what you know and that&#39;s you know is</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">that really relevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">um well i want to know jump in yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">yes i want to jump into um</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">you know somebody who has been a pivotal</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">in recent cognitive science famous</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">justifiably famous so</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">this is john cearl the famous creator of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">the chinese room argument which is of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">course an</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">important argument about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">mind and right intelligence and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">but cyril has another argument that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">people aren&#39;t as familiar with from his</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">book the rediscovery of mine which came</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">out in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">1992. um and cyril makes an argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting now give me a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">second on this greg because</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">as soon as i unfold it you&#39;ll then see</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">how the descartes stuff we just talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">is relevant so</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">cyril goes in and does something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">you and i mentioned needed to be done he</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">goes in and says he says</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">wait wait wait wait you&#39;re all using</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">this word representation and mental</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">representation let&#39;s slow down and look</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">at this okay let&#39;s slow down and look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">and he he draws on something again and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">there&#39;s already a long heritage coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">from descartes forward on this at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">have it implicit but often explicit in</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">many people&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">is that which is the idea and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">his term in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">that representations are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">aspectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">what does he mean by that he means like</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">that whenever i&#39;m representing something</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">and you can you can see how descartes</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">is like lurking behind you i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">if you read this part of descartes or</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">because seeger&#39;s work comes later i</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">think in publication day</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">but this object has just a huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">number of properties and there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">number of aspects to it unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">you know all right and so whenever</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">and whenever that emerges folks just if</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">you&#39;re playing that means that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">combinatorial explosion problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">yes exactly okay which means now you</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">have a frame problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">that you&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">solve unless you put constraints on it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">at some level</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">exactly exactly thank you greg well said</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">and we&#39;ll come back to that again</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">right i just want to make sure no no i</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s proper seating for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">whole relevance realization stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">and the and the and the investment and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">your investment theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">okay so what uh what cyril argues is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">you know if i represent this as a phone</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">or as a rectangle</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">or as a projectile or is the thing given</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">on my birthday right again we see the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">similarity to descartes right</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s all this has an innumerable</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">number of features that co-vary with me</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">right um and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">what cyril says is any representation is</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">inherently aspectual because out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">all of the properties i select some</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">subset</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">and they&#39;re not just legally pigelty</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re selected as</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">belonging together as forming</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">what you know you know the work of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">murphy and medine showed that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">organization with any con within any</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">concept we have of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">right we&#39;ll come back to that when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">talk about optimal grip and stuff okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">so i select all out of all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">properties i select some</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">right in terms of um the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">yep then i determine how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">relevant to each other and then also and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">this goes back to and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">now emphasized by 4e cognition</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">how it&#39;s relevant to me yes oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">particularly relevant to me brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">brilliant so uh the uh gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">uh okay this is you know which really</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">precursors some perceptual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">uh ways of thinking this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing in many ways they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">laws that pull things together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">in a particular way that force a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">uh and if you guys if folks want to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">know get a real experience of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">go check out like a uh a perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">illusion like the duck rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">depending on how you look at it okay you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">will see aspects just in your own</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">phenomenology they&#39;ll jump into a duck</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">collection and then they&#39;ll flip over</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">and they&#39;ll jump into a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">and you&#39;ll see the connection of all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">how the aspects actually yeah they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t randomly co-vary it depend on</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">you&#39;re deciding is relevant or what your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">frame of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">investment is in your relation to it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">all of a sudden it jumps</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">into those categories and wittgenstein</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">famously talked about the duck rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">and he also invoked the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">the term the dawning of an aspect um and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">brilliant i didn&#39;t know about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">the dawning of an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">and you know and the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">psychologist had the famous necker cube</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">and you&#39;ve all seen it that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">three-dimensional line drawing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">it flips on whether how it&#39;s oriented in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">three dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">so all of this clearly the case and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">so thrills then says okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">so all representations are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">aspectual notice how he&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">giving an independent argument</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">supporting what descartes is doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">that&#39;s important but then he does</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">something really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">again which sounds just like descartes</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">he says ah but every aspect is dependent</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">on a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">right because if i want to see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">duck i have this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">but if i want to see a as a rabbit i</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">have this point of view</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">right if i want to see it as a phone i</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">have this you know we&#39;ll talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">later i have this perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">of it yep because if i want to see it as</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">a weapon i have this etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">and then you go okay that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">reasonable point of view yep yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">and then he says aha now i have you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">and notice how this sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">descartes and i think it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">independent but convergent he said</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">but point of view is dependent on having</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">things can only have a point of view if</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a viewer</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.760" style="s2">and the metaphor of sight is being used</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">for to stand for all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.760" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">conscious awareness so a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">centers on a consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">cyril makes this argument he says</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">well you know what that means that means</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">there are no purely</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">unconscious representations</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">and he seems to have a view that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">remarkably similar to dakar he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">think that the brain has something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">states that could vary</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">and they only become representations</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">when they&#39;re actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">into consciousness and for similar</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s where they are in a sense made</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">ready for reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">because they are now given a determinate</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">so descartes that&#39;s not just a dusty</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">argument and then there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">kerfuffle about this because what</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">what cyril then said is so all this talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">about unconscious representations that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">are in</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">that can never be brought into</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">consciousness like chomsky&#39;s using or</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">you know or you know maybe you know even</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">some of the psychodynamic stuff or any</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">of the learning theorists</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">all of that&#39;s just no good because those</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">are those can&#39;t be representations</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">okay so people got like all upset and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">everything right right</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">all of a sudden you got a language</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">police problem and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">but yeah now what i want to say to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">is i think what you&#39;ve got is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">independent and converging argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">and we&#39;ve drawn a lot of people together</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">wittgenstein the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">right right for the the prop that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:19.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">between representation and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.320" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.800" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">aspectualization and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">this has to be unpacked now cyril and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">descartes are making a very linear</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">right uh representation depends on our</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">specialization which depends on</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s the function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">now what i want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">is but maybe there&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">doing another way of getting that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">the order right right what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">is that maybe there is something</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:55.359" style="s2">deeper that is needed</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">for aspect realization and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.359" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">alluded to and notice how i invoked it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">described how you form a representation</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">and this is the process</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:05.839" style="s2">of relevance realization of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">combinatorial explosive</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.839" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">amount of information available to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">in the object</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">i zero in on what&#39;s relevant and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">how those pieces belong and fit together</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s relevant to me this</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">relevance realization going on right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">what if we what if we inverted the order</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">and said no no</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">maybe relevance realization can generate</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:33.240" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">and the aspectualization and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.240" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">aspectualization then can give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">consciousness what if we reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">causal error because of course one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">prominent problems that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">fall into is the a b confusion of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">causation right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">right right what if</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">there is lots of unconscious processing</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">that&#39;s doing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">that then makes a specialization</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">possible in representation</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">and then that aspectualization can be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">basis for</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">then we would get out of all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">problems that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">and searle are giving us right and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">immediately has</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">resonance around a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">different domains yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">i mean uh so</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">i&#39;ll just say one for example okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">so when we think about making something</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">an aspect that becomes salient um folks</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">i&#39;m sure of the experience of everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:34.000" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">much of what you do if you do it over</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.000" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">and over again all of a sudden we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">drift it at least into pretty far away</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">right yes they sort of get into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">procedural way of being that is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">far away from</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">our conscience but then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">you get surprised okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">and that consciousness all immediately</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">comes back online all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">yep exactly exactly so if all of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">sudden then the aspect of that system</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">needs to be brought together to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">integrate a whole brain function to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">connect things so that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">start engaging mental manipulation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful greg and notice how</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">what the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">insight does for you the insight</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">like you know remember when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">about how the duck rabbit flips well you</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">get that same kind of flip in an insight</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve been framing it one way and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">reframes another way</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">and notice how that is accompanied and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s prototypically even</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">with the icon of the light bulb there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">a flash there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">right right and there&#39;s uh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a somehow there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">accentuation of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">in that salience restructuring of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">we find relevant your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">opens up yes yes and see if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">invert the order of explanation</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">by inverting the order of causation we</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">can start to explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">all of these phenomena and we can also</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">explain how a lot of your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">could nevertheless be so sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:05.280" style="s2">in terms of its intelligence amen so</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">i want to propose to you that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">now that means uh that brings up two</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">competing</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">vehicles for consciousness right one is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">that consciousness is a function</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">of representational content</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">and that and of course the problem there</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">is well we have so many unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">right right let&#39;s say we and so what</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:30.880" style="s2">many people do</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">they reject cyril is what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.880" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">they say well consciousness is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">representation some kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">representation it&#39;s representations of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">because this they know in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">the mind somehow touches</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">itself and we&#39;ll take a look at that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">there&#39;s i mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">intelligent proposal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">i want to propose to you and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">perhaps where i&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">perhaps innovative um that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">trying to build consciousness out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:02.839" style="s2">representational content</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">we try to build it out of the process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.839" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">that is presupposed by representation</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">and also presupposed by consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">and i want to argue that we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">explain that aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">in terms of processes that are neither</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">themselves intelligent or consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">but neither intelligent nor conscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">namely the process of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">right that&#39;s setting up that argument</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">there right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s i believe certainly anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">i&#39;ll say uh talk about a light bulb when</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">i heard you first</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">lay this out you know i was excited all</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">day okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">so i i think it&#39;s a hell of a i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a hell of an innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">certainly if</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">it all i mean i got i i wrote you or</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">whatever i was you know so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s as we&#39;re teasing it a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">bit here but it&#39;s like yeah no this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">shift certainly for me and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">quite a fair amount about these issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">well that&#39;s why i&#39;m in dialogue with you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">i think you&#39;ve thought of a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">and you thought very well</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">what i&#39;m pointing to is that realization</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">might give us sorry</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">might be the basis for an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:15.000" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">as to what consciousness does it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.000" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">aspectulizes</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">so that there are representations and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">does further aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">so that those representations are ready</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">for reason right all that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to come back to that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">we might see that in the shift as you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">already indicated from</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">things being relevant to us the things</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">being salient to us</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">that in a minute right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">and then that might also help to explain</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">nature or the emergence of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">because if you can get a system that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">capable of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">then it can start to aspectulize and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">then it can start to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">the basis of what we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">about when we talk about perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll know it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">so we might be able to go ahead let me</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">add that uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">so we talked about uh you know making</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">ready for reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">okay um but actually what i&#39;m gonna then</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">suggest is really when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">about the evolution it&#39;s gonna be ready</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">for simulation</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">yes yes okay so then in other words so a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">rat can get to a maze and then simulate</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">which side of the team is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">gonna go to okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">and then they&#39;re gonna they&#39;ll run</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">through particular uh investment paths</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">and make some cost-benefit calculation</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">around that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">so this goes towards a theory one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">neuroscientific theories we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">the information closer theory that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:38.839" style="s2">argues that the main function</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">of consciousness is to afford</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.839" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">counter-factuality</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">that we can uh right we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">organisms can work in a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">uh which of course is not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">as cold lawn reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">but it is again deeply presupposed by</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">all reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">it sets the stage for it very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">nice metaphor there okay so let&#39;s talk a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">this aspectualization and i want to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">to some</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">work and sort of build up to it a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">bit more i want to work</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">move to the work of zen and pollution</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">um which he&#39;s got i think the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.520" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">science fiction sounding name of anybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">in cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">his last name by the way everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">not have any vowels in it it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">all what it&#39;s all the letter y coalition</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">um and so and we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">where pollution is coming from pollution</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">is one of the godfathers with jerry</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">fodor</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">of computational functionalism and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">computational theory of mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">so the fact that he&#39;s going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">argument that he makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">is is something that he was led to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">by the data being generated in his</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">experiments because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">it significantly challenges in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">the standard model</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">that he had developed with voter about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">computational theory of mind at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">to many people&#39;s minded to my mind so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">what pollution was doing was he was</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">studying vision and what you might even</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">call visual attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to have to get into what</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">a relationship we&#39;re doing attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">awareness and consciousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.720" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">brat</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">so just give me for those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">already getting your knives out just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">wait okay give me a chance uh but what</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">he was doing is he&#39;s doing a thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">called multiple object tracking so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">say there&#39;s a computer screen</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">and there&#39;ll be a bunch of shapes on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">like a bunch of x&#39;s and zeros</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">and then they&#39;re moving around and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">say the x&#39;s are all different colored</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">like red and green</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">what you have to do is you have to track</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">them so let&#39;s say there&#39;s a green</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">x and it starts here and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">able to tell me where it ends and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">you know a pink circle here where does</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">it end now you may think well i can only</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">do one object at a time it turns out no</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">you can do more than that and uh you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">there&#39;s some question about how big this</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">is between five and eight let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">controversy you can track that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">it&#39;s called multiple</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">object tracking yeah okay you say well</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">who cares about this well just hang on a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">sec</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">okay uh so</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">what what politician uh noticed</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">is as you max out how many things</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">are trapped there&#39;s a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">relationship and that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">trade-off relationships are gonna be key</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">to relevance realization there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">trade-off relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">between how many objects you can track</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">and how many properties you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">attribute to each object</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">so as i open up the number of objects</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">i&#39;m tracking and i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">overload this system with demand what</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">happens is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">well let me describe it in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">happens in the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s say there&#39;s this thing here on</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">the computer screen and it started as</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">a is a red circle and while it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">it changes into a green</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">x it changes its color and its shape</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">people don&#39;t notice the change in color</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">and shape</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">right all they can all they can say is</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">whatever started there</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">is now there there okay so</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">they don&#39;t they they lose any</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">um conceptual properties for the object</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">all they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">is what uh politician called fingers of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">instantiation and then he</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">created this instinct and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">like if i like he thought of like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">mind has like like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">like almost like elastic fingers but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what this is but it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">put its finger on it and know where it</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">where it is where it is right like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">right right let me use an example so</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">uh so remember we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">about the duck rabbit thing right right</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">right to maintain attention on it then</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">all the aspect realization comes there</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">but you can then basically zoom out just</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">have an outline of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">okay and have some notion about its</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">positionality</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">but you&#39;ll lose your contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">tax with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">richness right exactly so all of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">uh all of the sort of adjectival content</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">disappears now what&#39;s left</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">is and if you have to forgive me people</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">need to talk this way and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t have ready available terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">has actually been part of the language</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">game problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">but what is this doing well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">here now</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">here now here now here now here now here</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">now here now</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">so this is called invexicality</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">indexicals are things</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">that don&#39;t have a categorical</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">content to them let me so here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">indexical</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">this okay i can use this for anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">this this this this</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">right that&#39;s different from cat</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">cat has a content to it yes like a set</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">of properties</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">okay right so this is a purely indexical</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">tracking here now here now here now</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">here now so i&#39;m going to call this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">these are adverbial qualias</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">they are not adjectival quality as like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">shape</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">or color or kind of thing it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">right they are merely adverbial they are</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">telling you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">right where and when here now here now</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">and all they&#39;re doing all they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">is what i call salience tagging</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">when your finger touches this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">making this here now this</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">salient to you yep standing out for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">that&#39;s all it is it&#39;s salient tagging</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no adjectival content to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">purely</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">adverbial it&#39;s pure here now</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">now you might say okay who cares ah then</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">politician has this really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">argument i&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">get another object here and another one</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">i should have done this ahead of time no</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">uh but uh it&#39;s it&#39;s important yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">okay so politian</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">requests from us that we understand he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">going to use a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">he&#39;s going to use a metaphor from</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">language but he does not need to imply</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">that the process he&#39;s describing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">is a linguistic process right it is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">linguistic metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">for a much more primordial process</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">he thinks i think correctly and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">evidence for it that animals have to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">able to do even</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">this object tracking right thing okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">what&#39;s the linguistic metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">i just used that a few minutes ago the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">linguistic metaphor is the linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">metaphor of demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">so things have categorical reference</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">words like cat</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">dog right chicken right</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">but there are things that only have</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">demonstrative reference because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">purely indexical</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">i can only do the reference in</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">demonstration like when i say</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">this it this yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">so all i&#39;m doing is here now this</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">is being salient to you this</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">salience tagging yep demonstrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">reference now</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">collision says notice that you need</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">demonstrative reference in order to form</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">your categories he says</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">if i&#39;m going to form a category i have</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">to mentally</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">draw things together i have to go this</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:24.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">this i have to first i have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.040" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">pre-categorical ability to draw them</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:32.000" style="s2">make them salient together in the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:32.000" style="s2">here now-ness</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">so fencing salience tagging</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">is actually presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">by any categorical identity right</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">so before i can aspectualize this</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">as a pencil yep i have to have first</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">had something that allowed me to draw</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">things together adverbially</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s no adjectival content</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">because there&#39;s no category</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t know there&#39;s no wetness to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">is i just have it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">this this this ah now that they&#39;re drawn</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">together and salient</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">they&#39;re right they&#39;re right together in</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">the same here and this nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">now i can start to see how they belong</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">and i can start to categorize them and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:23.210" style="s2">find patterns of similarity and draw out</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">particular aspects</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.210" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.880" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">so that means what pollution argues</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:31.359" style="s2">what he&#39;s uncovering in the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">object tracking</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">is something that is deeper he says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">by all of our conceptual abilities and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">here&#39;s notice what it&#39;s doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">making things ready for reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">by drawing them together through</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">salience tagging</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">so that similarity can be noticed</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">between them and similarity we&#39;ll argue</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">later is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">just an inherently a relevance</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">realization function i see how they</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.160" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">belong together</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">right and that makes aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.319" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">it&#39;s brilliant as far as i&#39;m concerned i</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">let me i&#39;ll riff off this real uh see</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">where why i had such a positive reaction</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2">okay from my own journey and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">some sense-making stuff that i was doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">um so you know i&#39;m really big on</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">concepts of behavior figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">yeah of course at multiple levels uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">like one of the things is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:29.920" style="s2">relationship between phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.920" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">both epistemologically and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">very fascinating uh ontological</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">relations across multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">okay so for example our capacity to pull</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">objects all right and then track their</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.880" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">yes all right yeah uh and i became you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.880" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">know convinced by a whole host of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:52.400" style="s2">uh data um but i&#39;ll get to the language</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">issue in just a second</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.400" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s that what is happening um is</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">that we have perceptual categorical</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">for objects in fields okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">and how they change and then what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">their constituent</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">elements that make them up okay um</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">and so now let&#39;s run to make another</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">connection here in the human mind and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">the formation of language</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">okay um so what are the what are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">elements of of grammar and language and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">syntax</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:25.599" style="s2">okay the fundamental categories of is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">noun</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.599" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">yes all right okay so that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:35.200" style="s2">okay a verb which is how the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">changes right and then adjectives</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.200" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">which are corresponding to differences</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">within the noun or okay so i was like</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">yeah okay so there&#39;s a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">symbolic tag noun verb adjective right</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:50.160" style="s2">yeah but what i overlooked and what this</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">brought to bear is well yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.160" end="00:53:54.960" style="s2">presupposes</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">the existence of a categorical system</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.960" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">that&#39;s defining objects</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">right right and changes that sets the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">stage for them to be honed in on if need</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">be but you need to have that frame</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">right i never really had brought i was</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">seeing through the lens of the frame</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">but your system then immediately caused</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">me to jump out and say oh right the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">frame has got to be built</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">yes exactly frame has got to be built to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">presuppose all of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">so i was like oh i i hadn&#39;t really had</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:23.839" style="s2">piece of awareness and then when you do</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">it and it lines up the way and then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.839" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">could say well wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">the presupposing of that frame the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">machinery the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">uh all that that starts to line up with</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">a lot of cool things</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s well said thank you greg and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">pollution argument is showing and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">i think i have conversion arguments for</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">pick up on this language you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">is any of the processes within the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">right are not going to be processes that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">are going to you&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">use to explain how the frame is</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">generated in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">because you&#39;re just if all the processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">within the framing presuppose the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">and therefore are not going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">to explain it and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">what collision is saying he&#39;s saying all</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">of the conceptual machinery</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">right and all of the i would argue the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">representational machinery</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.359" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">is not going to be able to explain this</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">right it is based on a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">by this least in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">pre-categorical preconceptual</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">machinery of fencing of salience tagging</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">absolutely i&#39;m reminded of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">experiments i&#39;m blanking exactly on</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole cluster of them sure you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">are aware mostly social psych</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">experiments uh like where a guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">is talking to somebody they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:39.599" style="s2">that well yeah yeah yeah yeah changing</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.599" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">something yeah there it is of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:44.880" style="s2">yeah thank you for that yep</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">change mine that&#39;s right so yeah people</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.880" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">will yeah you can do a thing where</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">a bunch of people walk past it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">stranger right</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">with like a like they&#39;re just excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">and they pass like</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">they care a piece of plywood and while</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">they&#39;re passing that person</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">is replaced by another person sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">different gender even</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">right race can change very yeah people</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">don&#39;t notice that it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">right right and whenever you say that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">everybody in the everybody out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">right now is saying oh i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">yeah right right whatever like like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">gorilla experiment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">i&#39;d see it well actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">now it&#39;s amazing but that just shows how</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">much operation</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">maybe is going on with basic fenstein</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">which we assume</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">is doing aspect realization but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">actually oh my god how much</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">you know cognitive work is being done by</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">just organizing where things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">and then you know filling in the blind</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">spots when we need to but a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:43.839" style="s2">running off of you know that frame</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">thank you okay so let&#39;s do a quick cycle</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">back to descartes and then we&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">so notice what i&#39;m doing i&#39;m swinging</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">between descartes and current you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">important cognitive scientists like</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">searle and politician right and notice</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve got both conceptual arguments from</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">cyril and experimental data</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">uh from pollution both you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">the argument is</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">in a good argument it should be taken</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">seriously and the data is robust and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">reliable</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:09.520" style="s2">replicate it replicates well et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">et cetera all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.520" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">okay so descartes let&#39;s go back what</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">does descartes think&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">well he isn&#39;t in it and he&#39;s struggling</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s vagueness there</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">but um again through the through uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">you know from the help of bill seeger by</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">the way i&#39;m not claiming that bill</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">seeger and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">bill seeger agrees with everything i say</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:32.079" style="s2">but i&#39;m giving due credit</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">for his important uh uh affording</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.079" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">influence on me</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">so they people know some of this story</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">descartes has the famous idea about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">pineal gland</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">right and you know enough that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">solution to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">but putting aside that it fails to solve</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">the mind brain problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">you should notice what descartes is</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">doing he seems to think that all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">these co-variations somehow get super</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:57.839" style="s2">imposed on each other and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.839" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">into consciousness all right</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of how this aspect</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">realization takes place</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">so he uses the metaphor of you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">super super imposition right</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">um that somehow brings an integration</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">but when i when i read that i thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">crap there&#39;s two different people from</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:22.240" style="s2">two different traditions</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">that i think are talking about that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.240" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">one is michael palani</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:28.079" style="s2">okay coming out of sort of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">analytic</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.079" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">uh north american scientific tradition</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">he&#39;s originally a scientist then he</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">becomes a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s martial ponty french</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:39.119" style="s2">french person coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">phenomenological tradition right</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.119" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">so i normally do this with people about</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">like uh actually run through it but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">just describe and i and i&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">multiple times and that&#39;s why these</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">examples are used by poland</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:52.960" style="s2">and used by marlo ponte and used</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">repeatedly and convert and they were</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.960" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">independent of each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">as far as i can tell uh marlo ponti</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know anything about planning i</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">don&#39;t think pelani knows marvel pontiac</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">let me just describe i&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">touch because touch is slower</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">than sight um and then therefore you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">have sort of more introspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:11.280" style="s2">awareness of what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">so what i do is i&#39;ll often you know you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">know hold up your hand and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:15.760" style="s2">put an object in your hand</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">i know what this object is but pretend</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.760" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t and right</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">or i&#39;ll put it on the table in front of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">you and you&#39;re going to close your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">as if you&#39;re a blind person and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">going to tap it</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">with right an object this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:29.280" style="s2">your probe</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">this is the blind man&#39;s cane uh again</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.280" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">used</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">independently by both pilani and marla</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">ponti</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">and so and what you&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">you&#39;re going to tap it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">and you&#39;re tapping it to aspectualize it</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re tapping it so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:44.839" style="s2">you can right from the tappings you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:46.559" style="s2">be able to and notice this is a weird</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.839" end="00:59:49.520" style="s2">thing figure out</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">what it is right and of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">going to figure it out according</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the aspect of it but notice what</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">notice what i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">i&#39;m getting i&#39;m getting a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">instinct here now</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">here now here now here now here now here</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">now is that is that okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">yeah salience tagging but when people do</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">right they&#39;ll often they can often tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">me oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i get it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">a phone it&#39;s a phone</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">right and then i&#39;ll say okay keep</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">tapping it but now instead of</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">paying attention to what it is pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">attention to what your pencil is doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">how it&#39;s making those moments of contact</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">and they go yeah i can do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">i say can you now also instead of paying</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">attention to your pencil pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">to how your fingers are moving the pet</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.599" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll say now see if you can pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">attention to the sensations by which</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling your fingers</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">and some people can and some people can</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">interestingly this is only anecdotally i</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">haven&#39;t done this experimentally but</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.599" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">very reliable the people who can who can</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:46.559" style="s2">become aware of the sensations in their</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">finger</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.559" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">are often people who&#39;ve had mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">okay and then and then i say and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">you can go to reverse you can go from</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">okay stop paying attention to your</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">sensations in your fingers</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">right pay attention to your pencil and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">then stop paying attention to your</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">pencil stop</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">start paying attention again to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">phone yep</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:11.119" style="s2">so notice what&#39;s happening right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.119" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">layers in there so i use a metaphor here</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.440" end="01:01:22.960" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s a metaphor used by actor</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">a psychologist met singer a philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.960" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">so again convergence and so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a transparency opacity shift let me</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">give you the analogy and you use the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">metaphor so right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:36.640" style="s2">i&#39;m and notice that notice how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">also framing</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">right i&#39;m looking through my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">i&#39;m looking by means of them and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:46.559" style="s2">them both</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:49.280" style="s2">by means of them beyond them so they are</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.559" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">transparent to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.280" end="01:01:55.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t see them i see through them</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">i&#39;m not aware of them i&#39;m aware through</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.599" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">but i can do this oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">now i&#39;m not aware i&#39;m not skiing through</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">my glasses</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">i&#39;m not looking through them i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:09.680" style="s2">at them they&#39;re opaque to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">because i&#39;m looking at them i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.680" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">looking through them i can step back and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:15.839" style="s2">look out</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">in a similar way initially i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to use looking as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:22.319" style="s2">metaphor here right</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">not looking at my pencil i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.319" end="01:02:27.440" style="s2">through my pencil at the object</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">but i can step back and look at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.440" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">pencil</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">right now what am i looking through i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">looking through my fingers at the pencil</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">and then i can step back and look at my</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">fingers</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">right and then i can even some people</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve had the training the practice</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">i can step back and look at my</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">sensations and i can go the other way</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">so each time i step back and look at i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">doing a transparency opacity shift</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">and each time when i go the other way</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:53.039" style="s2">i&#39;m doing an opacity to transparency</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening is things</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">moments of salience tagging and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:02.640" style="s2">maybe what sensations maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">primitively are are being integrated</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.640" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">into an aspect</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.000" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">and then those and then those aspects</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">are integrated into further aspects</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">and so on and so forth and and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">planning talked about</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">that attention has a from two structure</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">i&#39;m always attending through what he</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">my subsidiary awareness into my focal</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">i&#39;m attending through my pencil yep</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">to the phone so i use this example when</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">i came</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">across it okay and then i was like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">god looking through looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">and i was loving that all right i was on</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.319" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">on my walk and i was like oh my god i</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.480" style="s2">i could now see this i was really</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:44.720" style="s2">excited and then actually it evolved</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">okay so one of my arguments about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.720" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">evolved into a real useful tool that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">think at least other people have now</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:52.880" style="s2">told me oh i get what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">okay so one of my key points uh in my</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.880" end="01:03:57.760" style="s2">critique of psychology science</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">is work enormous ambiguity about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.760" end="01:04:02.559" style="s2">concept of behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">right right right okay um and actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.559" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">my argument is that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">huge problems with it is that it has</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">three different meanings</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">okay one of which is epistemological</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">yes right based on you step outside and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">then you look at the object field change</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">which modern science forced us to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">that shift which we then quantify</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">in relationship to primary entities</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">right right okay and so now basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">that requires</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">then a grammar from an exterior to use</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">ken wilbur&#39;s term an exterior</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:35.520" style="s2">right right right and then that frames</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">either everything that&#39;s why like</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.520" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">physics some physicists describe physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">as the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the science of the behavior of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">universe at all scales</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what physicists will sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">say okay so that&#39;s a general definition</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:50.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not then if psychology</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">can&#39;t be the science of behavior yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.160" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">yeah okay if physics is the science of</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">behavior at all scales</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:58.319" style="s2">i mean if atoms behave then we can then</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">psychology can&#39;t be the science of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.319" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:02.480" style="s2">it has to be a science of a behavior of</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:05.440" style="s2">a particular kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">yes right okay and that&#39;s what i argue</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.440" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">actually the class</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">of behaviors using the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">taxonomy should be</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:15.520" style="s2">mental behaviors right right right right</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">both overt that you see directly and</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.520" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">covert that you infer</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">revelation okay so so then in my book</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m saying hey</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">scientists stop looking through</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.400" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">the frame of behavior take the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">glasses off</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">right and see that actually the grammar</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">of your justification system is</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">essentially framed by looking through</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">the behavioral glasses and if we become</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">aware of that then we can become aware</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:43.119" style="s2">of the language game that science</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">plays uh and the grammar that they</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.119" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">structured it around</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:47.599" style="s2">and i structured around i&#39;m a scientist</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">but we want to be aware</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">of the rules and and framing uh that</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:54.559" style="s2">really drive the system</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">no that was beautiful greg that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.559" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">so i want to come back to that actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">at some point because</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">notice how your metacognitive ability is</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">making use of the transparency opacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">shifted</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">and how it&#39;s presupposed in our ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:14.000" style="s2">make ourselves ready for reason namely</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:15.119" style="s2">do some kind of self-correction in our</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.000" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.119" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">well you gave me one of the many light</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.480" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">bulbs you gave me john as i listened to</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:20.799" style="s2">your work</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">thank you for saying that well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.799" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">sharing it back fred</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">um so notice what we have here</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">we have we have some we have a process</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">helena calls integration you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">a little bit careful of that word though</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">and he is careful he&#39;s not equivocating</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">because there&#39;s two senses of</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">integration there&#39;s integration in which</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">you know you know here&#39;s the parts of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">chair and they&#39;re integrated together</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">you can still</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">see all the parts right but what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:49.200" style="s2">talking about is more like</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:50.000" style="s2">this i have like i have a left field of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.200" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.000" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">and a right field of vision and you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:54.720" style="s2">you can do this put your finger</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">and open and close your eye and you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.720" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">see your finger move right</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.799" style="s2">you and what your brain does is it i</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">would say it fuses them like like</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.799" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">like like atomic fusion but it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s the kind of integration in</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">which the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">left and right visual field you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">see the left and right visual field you</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">through them into depth perception i</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">right i don&#39;t see the moments of tapping</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">i see through them</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">to do the object so i am doing some kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">like fusion integration of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">salience tappings of moments of hear</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">nowness</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">and that is actually a process by which</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">i am aspectualizing them bringing them</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">into a kind of focal awareness</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.280" end="01:07:44.960" style="s2">which is a higher form of salience out</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:47.280" style="s2">of all the things that initially</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.960" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">are like grabbing my attention this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:52.079" style="s2">now given extra attention</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">and at the same time i&#39;m aspectualizing</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.079" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:57.200" style="s2">i&#39;m right i&#39;m integrating those things</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.200" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">right into a particular structural</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">functional organization so</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:04.000" style="s2">again descartes seems to have been</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">intuitively on the right track</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.000" end="01:08:09.039" style="s2">there&#39;s some sense in which i have all</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">these co-variations</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.039" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">moments of co-variation and then when</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">they are integrated in this way</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to argue that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">of a data compression thing happening in</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">later but when they&#39;re integrated i get</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">the aspect realization</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">i&#39;m now ready for reason both in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">sense that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">begun the process of giving it</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">categorical content and also your point</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.239" style="s2">i&#39;ve now made it metacognitively</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:36.719" style="s2">available for self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.239" end="01:08:38.239" style="s2">two of the things presupposed in making</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.719" end="01:08:41.120" style="s2">something ready for reason</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.239" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">right and then you can see that part of</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.120" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">consciousness is doing then is and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">i would argue the pivotal thing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.839" style="s2">consciousness is doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">is this process of recursive relevance</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.839" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">realization that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">making aspectualization possible for us</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">right and i want to and so for me then</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:04.080" style="s2">what i want to say is</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">when i hear that i&#39;m like oh okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.080" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">yeah and and the reason that this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">another light bulb are all tangled</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">together in this particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:11.520" style="s2">light bulb is notice folks</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing now or what john is</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.520" end="01:09:15.679" style="s2">doing and then i&#39;m really uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:16.319" style="s2">latching on to is we&#39;re really building</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.679" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.319" end="01:09:21.600" style="s2">cognitive functional view of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">consciousness is about this witnessing</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">function of framing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:27.520" style="s2">spectralizing yeah right okay we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">not talked</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.520" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">about what does almost everybody talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">about in consciousness oh redness</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">how the heck does redness happen okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly where i</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:39.279" style="s2">you know go and it is an important part</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">of this uh equation undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.279" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">but notice we haven&#39;t talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">the features and the experiential</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">qualia we have talked about framing</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">um and the functionality of framing that</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">sets the stage for aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">okay so that to me is that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">that&#39;s what feels so huh and then when</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:09:59.199" style="s2">we see that relation as it will come</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.199" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be really really important</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">so for me that was a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:07.280" style="s2">really cool oh wow it&#39;s like a common at</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:10.320" style="s2">this uh with a very rich</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.280" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">view from a different angle than i yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.320" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">thank you for saying that i mean so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">this is very much</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.320" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">building consciousness at least the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:19.920" style="s2">functionality and maybe some of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">of consciousness out of the adverbial</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:26.640" style="s2">qualia first</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">right and really getting going as far as</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.640" end="01:10:30.640" style="s2">we can with them</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">before we turn to the problematic</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.640" end="01:10:33.760" style="s2">adjectival qualia like redness and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:36.560" style="s2">blueness</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.760" end="01:10:37.120" style="s2">right right so so it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.560" end="01:10:39.600" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.120" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">object fields the structure of object</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.600" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">fields without getting in</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:44.560" style="s2">to the quality qualities of those object</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">fields we have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.560" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">we have to have a way to bring hereness</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">and and nowness to the object field</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.719" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">framing relation right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">a third thing there&#39;s the hereness</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:56.560" style="s2">the nowness and with the integration the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">togetherness yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:11:01.040" style="s2">the hereness the now-ness and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">togetherness and this goes to what uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:05.280" style="s2">uh marlo ponte called optimal gripping</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:08.719" style="s2">um and this is the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.280" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">you&#39;re always and and and and mason in</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.719" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">his book sentience talked about this in</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">terms of what he called sizing up</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:16.320" style="s2">so whenever i&#39;m specializing i&#39;m sizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:16.960" style="s2">up in order to get an optimal grip</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.960" end="01:11:21.760" style="s2">right so like do i look do i look at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:22.640" style="s2">object here well i might if i need the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.760" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">details</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.640" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">do i look at the object there well you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:28.560" style="s2">know that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:29.520" style="s2">too uh for the gestalt but i&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.560" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">some of the deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.520" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">so typically i&#39;ll try and find a place</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">where i get and they&#39;re in a trade-off</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:36.400" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:38.560" style="s2">right so i&#39;m going to get the place</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">where i get sort of the optimal balance</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.560" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">between the the the features and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">gestalt</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">but what counts as an optimal balance is</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:48.719" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:49.840" style="s2">well what&#39;s relevant to me and the task</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:51.920" style="s2">that i&#39;m undertaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:53.600" style="s2">if i want to throw this at you i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:54.880" style="s2">to optimally grip it in a different way</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.600" end="01:11:58.719" style="s2">if i want to write with it</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.880" end="01:12:01.040" style="s2">or if i want to paint it right</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.719" end="01:12:03.679" style="s2">so that aspectualization is also</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.040" end="01:12:05.679" style="s2">simultaneously a process of sizing up</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.679" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">what that means is i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.679" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">trade-offs between what&#39;s foregrounded</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">and backgrounded</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">what is gestalt and what is feature</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:15.440" style="s2">and and all of that is relative to what</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.440" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">what problems or tasks am i undertaking</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">and of course this is part of your</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">whole point about uh you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:26.080" style="s2">decisions about how am i investing</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:27.360" style="s2">right how am i investing my metabolic</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.080" end="01:12:28.800" style="s2">energy my precious</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">all the way all the way down the</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.800" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">bioenergetic scale right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">you&#39;re a vector uh moving toward and</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">away things</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">so yeah that frames that but yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">absolutely right so the promise i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:40.719" style="s2">going to leave people with because i</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:42.320" style="s2">think we should end it here is</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.719" end="01:12:44.719" style="s2">that all of that stuff we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.320" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2">about right about the trading off and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.719" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">investing the bioeconomic</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">and and doing all of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">zeroing in on relevance that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:56.960" style="s2">be i&#39;m going to discuss that with greg</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">explicitly when we move to the topic and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.960" end="01:13:00.800" style="s2">the theory of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">but that&#39;s where i think we can leave it</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.800" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">for today i think we&#39;ve made some</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">important progress today absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">so i&#39;ll just just summarize okay so a</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">fundamental shift here folks</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:11.760" style="s2">greg you&#39;re we&#39;re really quiet all of a</p>

<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:17.280" style="s2">little bit better yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.280" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll summarize just a fundamental point</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.280" end="01:13:21.840" style="s2">the shift between</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:22.960" style="s2">uh adjectival qualia into adverbial</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.840" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">qualia</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.960" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">and the framing of what we are doing to</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:30.560" style="s2">bring that hereness nowness togetherness</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:31.520" style="s2">uh is absolutely a fundamental shift in</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.560" end="01:13:33.920" style="s2">my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.520" end="01:13:36.480" style="s2">that really opens up so many different</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.920" end="01:13:40.239" style="s2">uh novel insights</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.480" end="01:13:40.880" style="s2">i agree well a great journey again</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.239" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">together</p>

<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">look at meta representational theories</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.440" end="01:13:55.440" style="s2">of uh of consciousness and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">gonna move properly into</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.440" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">uh you know neuroscientific theories of</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:02.320" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">great great fantastic alrighty okay i&#39;ll</p>
