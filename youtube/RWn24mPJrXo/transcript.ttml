<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:49.069" style="s2">imagine if it&#39;s not just hard but</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:51.139" style="s2">literally impossible for you to turn a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.069" end="00:06:53.180" style="s2">really meaningful and complex thing you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.139" end="00:07:00.379" style="s2">fully understand and care about into</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.180" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">communication to any other being and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.379" end="00:07:03.529" style="s2">that was the end of it but there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:10.370" style="s2">little bit more that I posted on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.529" end="00:07:22.629" style="s2">because it&#39;s me it&#39;s this it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.370" end="00:07:22.629" style="s2">a world that works for everyone and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.590" end="00:07:28.069" style="s2">sitting here with this knowing that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.419" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve known for a while and I am I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.069" end="00:07:35.659" style="s2">am actually autistic and that it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:38.060" style="s2">simultaneously something that society is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.659" end="00:07:39.529" style="s2">very against and expects you to conform</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.060" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">and expects you to behave in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.529" end="00:07:45.229" style="s2">way and I&#39;ve been giving up on that on</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:49.490" style="s2">repeat before I even knew I had autism</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.229" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2">and that that is powerful and what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.490" end="00:07:53.180" style="s2">talked about about becoming my more</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:56.449" style="s2">authentic self is that that like Who I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.180" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">am is more important than fitting into</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.449" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">society on a deep level and I think for</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:01.339" style="s2">autistic people that&#39;s maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.610" style="s2">so true than the rest</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.339" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">then there&#39;s Autism Awareness Month</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.610" end="00:08:09.860" style="s2">Autism Speaks which is a organization</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:11.419" style="s2">more or less designed for the parents of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.860" end="00:08:13.819" style="s2">autistic kids who want their kids to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.419" end="00:08:16.460" style="s2">normal who want them to like speak and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.819" end="00:08:19.639" style="s2">make eye contact and and have find a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:21.319" style="s2">cure for it and their logo is a puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.639" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">piece and people with autism are like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.319" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">but I&#39;m not a puzzle piece I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2">broken I&#39;m not and the irony being for</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">me both at the label of autism makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.000" end="00:08:33.649" style="s2">puzzles fit within me but also my whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:35.149" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m trying to explain to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.649" end="00:08:37.339" style="s2">world is that we are puzzle pieces</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.149" end="00:08:39.380" style="s2">not just people with neurodiversity but</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.339" end="00:08:41.209" style="s2">every single human being has their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.380" end="00:08:43.640" style="s2">unique puzzle piece it&#39;s everything that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.209" end="00:08:45.649" style="s2">is you it is that what your</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">intelligences are and aren&#39;t and your</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.649" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:51.270" style="s2">talents and your limitations and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">finding your other puzzle pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.270" end="00:08:57.690" style="s2">you click with so that you can be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:59.010" style="s2">functioning group is what we are going</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.690" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">to do together because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.010" end="00:09:05.130" style="s2">amazing about finding those people those</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:07.050" style="s2">people who get you and who make up the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.130" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">traits that you don&#39;t and I can see in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:12.900" style="s2">my life where I&#39;ve always had that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:15.570" style="s2">missing being that missing puzzle piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.900" end="00:09:19.650" style="s2">not necessarily the autism but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.570" end="00:09:22.050" style="s2">being of me and how I love creating</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.650" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">worlds and even sometimes characters but</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.050" end="00:09:26.250" style="s2">can&#39;t tell the story so like clearly I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:28.830" style="s2">can&#39;t be a writer where I can think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.250" end="00:09:32.070" style="s2">the entire complex way that we can save</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.830" end="00:09:35.400" style="s2">all of humanity but I can&#39;t send a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.070" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">freaking email like or get people</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.400" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">involved in it and I see how powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">that is how important that is because</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:45.210" style="s2">everyone is a puzzle piece everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">things they can&#39;t do and most people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.210" end="00:09:48.750" style="s2">are neurotypical are like yeah but i</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">buyed hate emails and then I send them</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.750" end="00:09:52.290" style="s2">I&#39;m like right oh how much more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:53.820" style="s2">was your life be if that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.290" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">requirement if just because something</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">was super hard for you you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">to do it we created the tools that made</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">it easy for you to be you and let the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:04.080" style="s2">people who rock it things and who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:08.070" style="s2">amazing at them and it&#39;s super easy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.080" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">like for do those things that only works</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.070" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">in a society with the technology to back</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:16.950" style="s2">it up where we have the platforms to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">able to make life easier we&#39;re honoring</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.950" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">where it&#39;s not easy and so I have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.310" end="00:10:26.130" style="s2">dream of finding a board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:27.900" style="s2">and it keeps fluctuating and all of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.130" end="00:10:30.210" style="s2">things but what I really want is a board</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.900" end="00:10:35.520" style="s2">of neurodiverse physically diverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.210" end="00:10:37.560" style="s2">emotionally diverse humans who have done</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.520" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">enough of the interpersonal work that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.560" end="00:10:41.400" style="s2">they kind of know what is their</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:43.560" style="s2"> and what should a society is adding</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.400" end="00:10:48.840" style="s2">to work through all of that in public so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.560" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">that we can work through the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.840" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">company&#39;s in public so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:55.830" style="s2">everyone can see</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:11:00.690" style="s2">because that process is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.830" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">powerful that process of creating the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.690" end="00:11:04.080" style="s2">corporation that is the cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create the tech that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.080" end="00:11:09.570" style="s2">going to save humanity and doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">public with transparency means our</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.570" end="00:11:13.560" style="s2">membership trusts it means it is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">more powerful to also be way more</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:18.870" style="s2">vulnerable for the board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.420" style="s2">and so it has to be people who are okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.870" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">with that and we have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.420" end="00:11:31.260" style="s2">membership base that is accepting of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.760" end="00:11:34.980" style="s2">neurodiversity and not not trolling it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.260" end="00:11:37.050" style="s2">that it is about there&#39;s just so much so</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.980" end="00:11:41.160" style="s2">we need to figure out but I am looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.050" end="00:11:47.640" style="s2">for our neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.160" end="00:11:49.830" style="s2">people who have ADHD and autism and OCD</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.640" end="00:11:51.720" style="s2">and anything that makes your brain think</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.830" end="00:11:54.210" style="s2">differently than someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.720" end="00:11:57.270" style="s2">neurotypical because we are not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.210" end="00:11:59.640" style="s2">fit in we are going to hone those super</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.270" end="00:12:02.220" style="s2">powers and figure out how to be exactly</p>
