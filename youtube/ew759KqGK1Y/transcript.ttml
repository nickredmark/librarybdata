<p begin="00:00:55.530" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">in ecology practices who&#39;s in discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.199" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">with you know good cog saw about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">you know and is you know familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">issues around meaning in the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">crisis yeah a little bit so you know my</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">base is parkour and before that martial</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">arts and really a lot of movement arts</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">but parkour is where I kind of wind deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">and and where a lot of these things for</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.689" style="s2">to gestate for me but you know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:29.610" style="s2">maybe a good place to start is that as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.689" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">reached kind of the end of my 20s I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.610" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">adopted a very much a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">professional idea of what is archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">right like what you should be aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">was to be aimed at like the professional</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">athlete model of being a parkour athlete</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">and that didn&#39;t take me where I needed</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">to take me and I started getting injured</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">and had a few other issues with that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">so I started asking this question of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:57.960" style="s2">like you know I had I had a competition</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">that I was training for in 2013 and I I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.960" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">tore my rotator cuff prepping for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">competition and then I was almost able</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">to compete I finished third in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:07.860" style="s2">qualification but the only way I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">complete when the course is he was to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">this 16 foot running jump where I had to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">catch with both my hands and I just knew</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:17.150" style="s2">my shoulder wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.769" style="s2">able to take it and so I&#39;ve had a series</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.150" end="00:02:22.909" style="s2">of injuries at that point and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.769" end="00:02:24.500" style="s2">looked in the mirror and I said do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.909" end="00:02:29.000" style="s2">tape yourself together to try to compete</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.500" end="00:02:30.349" style="s2">for a couple more years or do you change</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.000" end="00:02:32.209" style="s2">the way that you practice such as it can</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.349" end="00:02:33.980" style="s2">be sustainable for life and that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.209" end="00:02:36.650" style="s2">came down to like why do you do this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.980" end="00:02:39.849" style="s2">it because of because you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.650" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">reach these specific goals or is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.849" end="00:02:44.390" style="s2">because this does something for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply meaningful and I chose</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.390" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">that it was the meaningful thing and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:51.260" style="s2">I had been trying to compete and go you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:52.700" style="s2">know and all the competitions were</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.260" end="00:02:53.810" style="s2">indoors and I found that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.700" end="00:02:56.209" style="s2">really loving though was playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.810" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">outdoors in nature and so I went deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.209" end="00:03:00.409" style="s2">into that and I was really influenced at</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">the time by the work of Stuart brown on</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.409" end="00:03:05.690" style="s2">play and in in how important play and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">unstructured play is and Frank forensic</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.690" end="00:03:10.700" style="s2">his work with exuberant animal and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">was I was I was digesting those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.700" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about how they interacted</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">with what we were seeing with the growth</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.540" end="00:03:18.169" style="s2">of parkour and how parkour everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.970" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">parkour talked about the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.169" end="00:03:24.109" style="s2">philosophy of parkour but nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:26.599" style="s2">articulate what it was and so I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.109" end="00:03:29.199" style="s2">diving into this and and I really went</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.599" end="00:03:31.459" style="s2">deep into play and I started you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.199" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">interesting Lee Stuart Browns work talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.459" end="00:03:35.060" style="s2">a lot about pink steps rats but he</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you know yuck Pink&#39;s up in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.060" end="00:03:38.419" style="s2">research done on the rats but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:40.129" style="s2">recognize it and go back to pang step</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.419" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">directly through Brown wasn&#39;t until I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.129" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">found Jordan Peterson that I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:45.260" style="s2">introduced more deeply into that but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">was researching the rough and tumble</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.260" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">play and and Marc Bekoff and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.519" style="s2">wife actually did her her master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">thesis on parkour as a form of adult</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.519" end="00:03:58.639" style="s2">play so play took me somewhere really</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:04:00.739" style="s2">good but there was something about it it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.639" end="00:04:02.359" style="s2">wasn&#39;t quite complete because play was</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.739" end="00:04:04.099" style="s2">sort of just about the momentary</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.359" end="00:04:06.169" style="s2">experience and it wasn&#39;t taking you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.099" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">further than the momentary experience I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.169" end="00:04:12.199" style="s2">see and so I had had all this progress</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.370" end="00:04:15.139" style="s2">just from letting go of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.199" end="00:04:20.060" style="s2">that I had had of thinking of being an</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.139" end="00:04:21.620" style="s2">athlete right and but then and I was but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:23.180" style="s2">then I started kind of falling apart it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.620" end="00:04:25.550" style="s2">was like there was too much structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.180" end="00:04:27.290" style="s2">which caused stagnation and actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.550" end="00:04:28.520" style="s2">over stress</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.290" end="00:04:30.140" style="s2">then there was too little structure and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.520" end="00:04:31.310" style="s2">it was sort of like I started getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.140" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">injured because I just wasn&#39;t taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.310" end="00:04:35.150" style="s2">care of my body enough to do the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:36.770" style="s2">that I wanted to do and it was like my</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.150" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">attention was dissipating across too</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.770" end="00:04:41.480" style="s2">many things and so the idea of having</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">very specific goals came and there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.480" end="00:04:43.610" style="s2">this interesting thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve been teaching you know for many</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.610" end="00:04:46.250" style="s2">years and I was teaching these workshops</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">I was putting all these together these</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.250" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">ideas together and the basic idea is we</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">evolved from movement and we loved to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:57.980" style="s2">move to learn movement through play and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">I in in 2016 I found Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.980" end="00:05:03.190" style="s2">work well let me back up for a second</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">what I noticed was when I was teaching I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.190" end="00:05:06.860" style="s2">could I could spout scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">literature at people as a justification</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:12.290" style="s2">for why they should adopt the training</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:14.690" style="s2">things and people respected that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.290" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">when I told them stories about my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.690" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">experience they were moved by it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">and so I started to think that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:24.170" style="s2">within narrative there was something</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">incredibly powerful and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.170" end="00:05:29.180" style="s2">understand more about it and so in peers</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">and showed up on Joe Rogan you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.180" end="00:05:32.540" style="s2">there was the whole political preamble</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.190" style="s2">but somewhere in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.540" end="00:05:37.100" style="s2">conversation it switches to being about</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.190" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">narrative and about meaning and that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.100" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">when I was like this is this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">was looking for right and so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">then layering in all these ideas around</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:47.510" style="s2">narrative and the other thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:48.650" style="s2">happening in parallel to that was I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.510" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">started teaching these events where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.650" end="00:05:53.870" style="s2">took people from took people out to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.180" style="s2">family property that I&#39;d grown up on and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.870" end="00:05:58.790" style="s2">then we would travel out from there to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:00.950" style="s2">to train in these natural spots and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.790" end="00:06:02.600" style="s2">so we&#39;d have three-day event so before</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.950" end="00:06:06.890" style="s2">that all my club teaching was in group</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.600" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">classics and in the group class setting</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.890" end="00:06:09.230" style="s2">there&#39;s wonderful things that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:10.430" style="s2">but there was something completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.230" end="00:06:12.590" style="s2">different that started happening when</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:14.150" style="s2">you had three days with somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.590" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">then we went to five days it was even</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.150" end="00:06:17.300" style="s2">deeper and I started listening to my</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:19.070" style="s2">students and I would ask them at the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.300" end="00:06:20.270" style="s2">of the seminar like what was what did</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.070" end="00:06:23.260" style="s2">you get out of this what was the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.270" end="00:06:25.430" style="s2">important thing about this and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.260" end="00:06:27.650" style="s2">expected it to be a jump that they did</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.430" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">right I expected it to be movements that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.650" end="00:06:32.330" style="s2">they learned I expected to be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:34.610" style="s2">knowledge that they attained but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.330" end="00:06:36.770" style="s2">always talked about feeling deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.610" end="00:06:39.020" style="s2">connected feeling connected to a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.770" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">and feeling all these things and so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.020" end="00:06:40.729" style="s2">started to pay attention to that and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:42.889" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.729" end="00:06:44.539" style="s2">lucky enough also to have students who</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.889" end="00:06:46.999" style="s2">came from the wilderness awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.539" end="00:06:48.589" style="s2">school which has been you know this</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.999" end="00:06:50.089" style="s2">wonderful place of developing nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.589" end="00:06:52.819" style="s2">connections it spotting meditative</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.089" end="00:06:55.430" style="s2">practices through John Young&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.819" end="00:06:56.779" style="s2">so they started coming and they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.430" end="00:06:58.490" style="s2">initially students</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.779" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">Kyle caulk has been on my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.490" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">recently was one of them and Jayme mock</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:04.430" style="s2">and Kyle&#39;s really come to work with us</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.689" style="s2">very deeply now but they started</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.430" end="00:07:07.219" style="s2">introducing all the nature of connection</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.689" end="00:07:09.439" style="s2">practices and thus its bodying and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.219" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">tracking and all these things into that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.439" end="00:07:16.249" style="s2">work and seeing how would parallel the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:17.899" style="s2">work with with with movement and I also</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.249" end="00:07:20.360" style="s2">ran into my friend Simon tackers work</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.899" end="00:07:22.520" style="s2">and also mark Walsh who who invited me</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.360" end="00:07:23.569" style="s2">and they you know Mark basically said</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.520" end="00:07:25.569" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching about him and he just</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.569" end="00:07:29.689" style="s2">don&#39;t know it yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.569" end="00:07:31.819" style="s2">when Simon had spent ten years in Asia</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.689" end="00:07:33.559" style="s2">learning different meditative traditions</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.819" end="00:07:35.449" style="s2">and martial arts traditions and then had</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.559" end="00:07:38.770" style="s2">the same kind of ancestral approach and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.449" end="00:07:41.839" style="s2">so I got to learn Metta meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.770" end="00:07:43.460" style="s2">and focus meditation from these guys and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.839" end="00:07:49.310" style="s2">see how they were deeply interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.460" end="00:07:51.289" style="s2">to a movement practice so so over time</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.310" end="00:07:54.289" style="s2">what we realized was that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.289" end="00:07:56.180" style="s2">there was there was a need to people</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.289" end="00:07:58.189" style="s2">word what people were coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.180" end="00:08:01.129" style="s2">events for was because they felt deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.189" end="00:08:03.409" style="s2">alienated and disconnected from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.129" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">things that give meaning to life and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.409" end="00:08:07.849" style="s2">there was a layer of that that is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:09.259" style="s2">like the momentary experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.849" end="00:08:12.020" style="s2">connection but then there was a layer of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.259" end="00:08:14.599" style="s2">it that is that continued development of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.020" end="00:08:16.159" style="s2">the human being out of its like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.599" end="00:08:19.219" style="s2">cultivation of the heroic self</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.159" end="00:08:22.669" style="s2">so it&#39;s like having you know having</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.219" end="00:08:25.490" style="s2">goals like I need to be able to lift 500</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.669" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">pounds deadlift 500 pounds it&#39;s specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.490" end="00:08:28.309" style="s2">it&#39;s actionable it&#39;s realistic it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">since it or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.309" end="00:08:33.349" style="s2">but why do you really want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2">right it&#39;s not actually motivational in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.349" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">itself it&#39;s just an arbitrary number</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:38.269" style="s2">it&#39;s because it represents this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:40.459" style="s2">archetypal sense of the self as being</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.269" end="00:08:42.469" style="s2">capable and powerful and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.459" end="00:08:44.839" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.469" end="00:08:46.940" style="s2">and so what I found was that the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.839" end="00:08:48.829" style="s2">specific smart measurable actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.940" end="00:08:50.810" style="s2">realistic goals they weren&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.829" end="00:08:52.819" style="s2">weren&#39;t they were too broad enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.810" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">umbrella and there was this conflict</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.819" end="00:08:56.010" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">there&#39;s this potential for conflict</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.010" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">between goals and what was actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:02.520" style="s2">deeply motivational and meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">you right right and so then we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.520" end="00:09:06.330" style="s2">thinking okay if we are aimed at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:08.580" style="s2">most heroic development of the self for</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.330" end="00:09:10.020" style="s2">a minute self transcendence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.580" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what this should be about and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.020" end="00:09:14.760" style="s2">then we found through the work that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">movement has that right parkour was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.760" end="00:09:19.110" style="s2">was the the genesis around the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:20.700" style="s2">self transformation and I was like well</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:23.280" style="s2">what is what would a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.700" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">parkour look like and then nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.280" end="00:09:26.700" style="s2">connection practices and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">mindfulness practices and then noticing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.700" end="00:09:31.770" style="s2">that that the community was what people</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:34.620" style="s2">were really coming for and then seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.770" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">that that there are actually practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.620" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">that deepen community and that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:40.860" style="s2">have an articulation or respect for them</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:43.320" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like singing songs</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.860" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">together dancing together spending time</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.320" end="00:09:47.010" style="s2">in a sauna together doing hard physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:48.870" style="s2">things together right struggle like</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.010" end="00:09:51.660" style="s2">hiking for a long time with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.870" end="00:09:53.880" style="s2">people all those things foster a deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.660" end="00:09:58.170" style="s2">sense the bombing that that people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.880" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">desperate for and don&#39;t have so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.170" end="00:10:02.700" style="s2">bit of the history of how of how this</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">has all come together and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.700" end="00:10:09.560" style="s2">and then when I found your work you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:12.780" style="s2">the the understanding of how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.560" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">connects to embodiment being better than</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.780" end="00:10:17.940" style="s2">the environment you know having enacted</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:19.530" style="s2">right an enacted practice I remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.940" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">before I interviewed for you for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.530" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">first time I was listening to a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:28.200" style="s2">you did I wish I could remember the name</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:31.140" style="s2">but you said something like the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.200" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">that you would have for Jordan is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.140" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">know you have you have this proposal of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">Christian pragmatism and you have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:41.430" style="s2">this theory and it&#39;s beautiful but</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">where&#39;s the practice yes yes and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.430" end="00:10:50.520" style="s2">that that hit really home with me right</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:54.570" style="s2">and and and so I&#39;ve viewed you as this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.520" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">extraordinary articulator of of the role</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.570" end="00:10:58.920" style="s2">of practice and how we bring practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:00.660" style="s2">together at college of practices so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.920" end="00:11:02.970" style="s2">said a lot and I I don&#39;t know if I said</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.660" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">enough but but I want to see what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.970" end="00:11:06.990" style="s2">come up whoa</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:10.500" style="s2">you were very eloquent that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.990" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">fantastic yeah I like that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.500" end="00:11:17.670" style="s2">interesting because I sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:19.889" style="s2">this there is this turning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.670" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">being accelerated by the co vid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.889" end="00:11:26.010" style="s2">towards the the centrality of practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">that have a you know real transformative</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.010" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">power and real aspirational impact and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">you know you mean see it on platforms</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:35.010" style="s2">like rubble wisdom where there a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:38.040" style="s2">reorientation toward the centrality a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.010" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">practice or even maybe practice is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.040" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">better because it&#39;s a whole network of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:46.589" style="s2">practices right it&#39;s becoming very clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:48.360" style="s2">and even trying to even in in these</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.589" end="00:11:50.220" style="s2">conversations is some of the work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.360" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">doing with you know with guys sans talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.220" end="00:11:54.779" style="s2">and Christopher master Pietro and Peter</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">Lindbergh Jordan Hall right is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.779" end="00:11:59.970" style="s2">turn these conversations into a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:02.220" style="s2">kind of transformative an aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.970" end="00:12:03.870" style="s2">practice as well so I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.220" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">know I think I think you put your finger</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.870" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">on something very interesting and I like</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:14.430" style="s2">the way like well you know I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:15.779" style="s2">about this in some ways you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.430" end="00:12:18.390" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing is very sort of top-down</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.779" end="00:12:20.010" style="s2">you know it&#39;s theory and science and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.390" end="00:12:22.019" style="s2">reaching down to try and figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.010" end="00:12:23.310" style="s2">would this look this can practice and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.019" end="00:12:24.899" style="s2">a very complimentary fashion your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.310" end="00:12:26.310" style="s2">discovery has been very bottom-up you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.899" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">in there doing stuff and you and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.310" end="00:12:30.779" style="s2">you work your way up towards theory and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s like this I think this is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.779" end="00:12:33.870" style="s2">of the ways why we we we we resonate so</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:35.579" style="s2">well together</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.870" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">because part of the argument I&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.579" end="00:12:40.019" style="s2">is we need both of those yeah we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">the top-down and the bottom-up and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.019" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">need them in to be in into deep and deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:47.550" style="s2">dialogue with each other if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:50.269" style="s2">afford what you what you said was at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.550" end="00:12:52.890" style="s2">core of this which is giving people real</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.269" end="00:12:55.769" style="s2">transform real transformation in their</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.890" end="00:12:58.170" style="s2">meaning of life that has a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.769" end="00:13:00.089" style="s2">trajectory to it I think that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.170" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">thing and I think what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.089" end="00:13:07.380" style="s2">with with the Cova crisis is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:09.810" style="s2">you know that the the the foregrounding</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.380" end="00:13:12.269" style="s2">of the need for meaning as deep and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.810" end="00:13:15.269" style="s2">long-lasting connectedness I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.269" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">coming is just is just being pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.269" end="00:13:18.960" style="s2">precisely because people have lost a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:21.870" style="s2">of connect</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.960" end="00:13:23.610" style="s2">I&#39;m in a certain way and this brings up</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.870" end="00:13:28.650" style="s2">a topic that you and I thought we might</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.610" end="00:13:29.730" style="s2">discuss which is the idea that that one</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.650" end="00:13:31.890" style="s2">of the things that Co vid</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.730" end="00:13:34.110" style="s2">crisis is doing is exacerbating the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2">meaning crisis by inflicting a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.110" end="00:13:41.550" style="s2">Dom aside on the world and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:43.410" style="s2">notion that I got from Brian Walsh he</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.550" end="00:13:45.150" style="s2">gets him from Fortius and Smith and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.410" end="00:13:47.430" style="s2">made use of it Chris and Phillip and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.150" end="00:13:48.930" style="s2">in the in the zombie book and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.430" end="00:13:52.620" style="s2">talking quite a bit about this in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.930" end="00:13:53.670" style="s2">of the videos and and then you know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.620" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">there&#39;s been other periods in history</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.670" end="00:13:59.700" style="s2">where there&#39;s been these kinds of so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:04.470" style="s2">dama side is you know the loss of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.700" end="00:14:05.940" style="s2">sense of home and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">happening with people very much their</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.940" end="00:14:10.650" style="s2">sense of where they feel safe where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:12.840" style="s2">feel at home right and and and and sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.650" end="00:14:15.570" style="s2">of the scope of their identity in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.840" end="00:14:18.360" style="s2">world is radically shrunk people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.570" end="00:14:19.590" style="s2">feeling disconnected they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.360" end="00:14:20.940" style="s2">disconnected of course from a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.940" end="00:14:25.530" style="s2">ending there&#39;s loneliness many people</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.180" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">are describing their experience using</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.530" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">the adjective surreal the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">connectedness to reality is disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:39.180" style="s2">um and so I think I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:42.840" style="s2">things I&#39;m trying to do is I&#39;m trying to</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.100" end="00:14:48.270" style="s2">contemplation course that I offered will</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.960" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">try and give people some tools and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.270" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">wanted to hear your thoughts around</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.800" end="00:14:56.070" style="s2">Thomas re and what you think and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:58.440" style="s2">like how your ecology of practices might</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.070" end="00:14:59.820" style="s2">be specifically relevant to that issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.440" end="00:15:03.030" style="s2">is that fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.820" end="00:15:04.140" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so the this is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.030" end="00:15:07.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.140" end="00:15:09.180" style="s2">about for a while now this idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.110" end="00:15:11.250" style="s2">does parkour zombies and everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.180" end="00:15:13.890" style="s2">interrelate with Dom aside I want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.250" end="00:15:16.220" style="s2">read your book the the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.890" end="00:15:21.030" style="s2">grassy narrows a shinobi I believe yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.220" end="00:15:23.220" style="s2">was extremely striking to me and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.030" end="00:15:26.010" style="s2">know he ignited something from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.220" end="00:15:29.310" style="s2">previous conversation but to summarize</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.010" end="00:15:31.770" style="s2">that right there was this this tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.310" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">people who were living and they had they</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.770" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">had a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:37.200" style="s2">far apart their houses should be and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">they had a sense of the the meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.200" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">landscape yeah and they were moved to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:47.670" style="s2">new reservation under good intentions</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:49.080" style="s2">right because it had access to things</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.670" end="00:15:53.760" style="s2">that they thought would improve but then</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.080" end="00:15:55.770" style="s2">we saw this massive massive suffering in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.760" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">their culture right only just a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.770" end="00:15:59.610" style="s2">bit do you remember it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:02.810" style="s2">rates of domestic violence went up right</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:05.610" style="s2">so the traditional suicide goes up</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.810" end="00:16:08.580" style="s2">there&#39;s two aspects to it one of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.610" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">is a biological physiological we</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.580" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">mentioned this in the book the movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:15.899" style="s2">did subject them probably to some kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">of mercury poisoning yeah but but but</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.899" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">what Brian was work was trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.910" end="00:16:24.209" style="s2">is that the capacity of course is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:25.529" style="s2">horrific right and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.209" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">Canadian government there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.529" end="00:16:29.399" style="s2">responsibility for that and so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:30.899" style="s2">trying to be dismissive and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.399" end="00:16:32.910" style="s2">try to be dismissive of that in the book</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.899" end="00:16:35.880" style="s2">but what Brian was trying to show is yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.910" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">but the capacity for the culture to try</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.880" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">and respond and deal with the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:50.070" style="s2">this and and sort of deal with with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:52.100" style="s2">movement there them being as you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.070" end="00:16:56.520" style="s2">moved to a different housing location</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.100" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">was deeply undermined by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.520" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">the government had given them a new kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">of arrangement of their their living</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:08.459" style="s2">space so you&#39;ve got a culture that these</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">people are being culture shock they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.459" end="00:17:13.740" style="s2">being moved ostensibly for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">then they&#39;re being put under a physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.740" end="00:17:18.839" style="s2">stressor of your poisoning right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:20.550" style="s2">then what happens is right their ability</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.839" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">to respond to this is dramatic because</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.550" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">they they they they they lose their</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:32.100" style="s2">sense of home because and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:36.210" style="s2">Brian&#39;s point houses becomes a become</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.100" end="00:17:42.140" style="s2">homes when they become basically tools</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.210" end="00:17:45.750" style="s2">very complex sets of tools by which we</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.140" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">symbolize inhabit in</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.750" end="00:17:50.310" style="s2">act our worldview how we fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.410" style="s2">are making sense of who we are what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.310" end="00:17:54.060" style="s2">world is and and how we relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.410" end="00:17:57.300" style="s2">other and by changing the housing</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.060" end="00:17:59.970" style="s2">structure all of these processes of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.300" end="00:18:01.650" style="s2">making sense were massively disrupted so</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.970" end="00:18:03.090" style="s2">at the time when these people most</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.650" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">needed to sort of feel really connected</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.090" end="00:18:07.680" style="s2">to themselves to the world right they</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:11.550" style="s2">were suddenly all of this was torn apart</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.680" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">and they and so they get huge increases</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.550" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">in violence and domestic violence and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:24.270" style="s2">suicide substance abuse like etc so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">it occurs to me is that a home not a not</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:28.770" style="s2">the physical structure of a house but a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:31.350" style="s2">but a home is where it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.770" end="00:18:33.900" style="s2">the central place from which attunement</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.350" end="00:18:37.950" style="s2">between the agent in the arena begin to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.900" end="00:18:41.250" style="s2">take disturb the meaning system around</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.950" end="00:18:43.320" style="s2">that home then you potentially disturb</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.250" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">that entire agent or inner relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.320" end="00:18:49.020" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s relatively invisible it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:52.530" style="s2">be very easy to say from like that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.020" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">know as a white Westerners who&#39;s used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.530" end="00:18:58.800" style="s2">living in a in an apartment block the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:01.410" style="s2">the meaning system in widok a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.800" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">traditional home and the land around it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.410" end="00:19:06.300" style="s2">in the way that it&#39;s used is embedded is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:08.040" style="s2">very invisible to us and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.300" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">disturb and destroy something that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.040" end="00:19:12.030" style="s2">very central to somebody and not even</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:14.340" style="s2">know that we&#39;re doing so Oh totally</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.030" end="00:19:17.940" style="s2">totally anyway and we and we also you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.340" end="00:19:19.350" style="s2">know we we also can do it to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.940" end="00:19:22.340" style="s2">without realizing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.350" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">people often when they consider moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.340" end="00:19:27.390" style="s2">they often are focused on and of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying they should dismiss that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.390" end="00:19:31.950" style="s2">they&#39;re focused on the socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:33.660" style="s2">factors and they and they forget I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.950" end="00:19:37.380" style="s2">remember when I like along when I first</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.660" end="00:19:40.020" style="s2">moved to Toronto and I was I was hit by</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.380" end="00:19:41.880" style="s2">this like there was a look and that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.020" end="00:19:43.980" style="s2">it was like culture shock it was like</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.880" end="00:19:46.500" style="s2">profound culture shock and I I felt you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.980" end="00:19:48.150" style="s2">know sort of a deep anxiety and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.500" end="00:19:50.430" style="s2">realize you start doing all these homing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.150" end="00:19:52.560" style="s2">things would they have actually no no</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.430" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">functionality to how you&#39;re making use</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.560" end="00:19:56.190" style="s2">of your dwelling an associate economic</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:57.170" style="s2">fashion but what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.190" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">trying to make your</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.170" end="00:20:02.660" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make your house a home</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">by doing all this symbolic all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.660" end="00:20:07.910" style="s2">symbolic work in it to try and alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:10.280" style="s2">that weird sense of displacement so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.910" end="00:20:13.160" style="s2">think we can also like that we I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.280" end="00:20:15.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not only we can be blind to how we</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:17.780" style="s2">might be affecting other people I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.860" end="00:20:19.130" style="s2">we&#39;re also blind we don&#39;t pay enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.780" end="00:20:24.410" style="s2">attention to how we are affecting</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">ourselves yeah I mean so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.410" end="00:20:27.170" style="s2">a little bit far fear but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:28.130" style="s2">always am an apology students so this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.170" end="00:20:31.160" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.130" end="00:20:33.350" style="s2">interested in is like culture and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.160" end="00:20:35.990" style="s2">diversity and how these things interact</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.350" end="00:20:38.330" style="s2">and and so there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.990" end="00:20:40.160" style="s2">big narratives that or there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.330" end="00:20:41.780" style="s2">narrative that is dominant academia now</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.160" end="00:20:44.690" style="s2">which in many ways is just an inversion</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.780" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">of a previous nerd where the early</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.690" end="00:20:51.410" style="s2">narrative was there there is a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:52.940" style="s2">of culture right and white Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.410" end="00:20:56.140" style="s2">culture is at the top of that culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.940" end="00:20:58.490" style="s2">and things is were bite and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.140" end="00:21:00.680" style="s2">essentially we&#39;re trying to get the rest</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.490" end="00:21:02.930" style="s2">of the world to catch up all right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.680" end="00:21:04.670" style="s2">when we impose our culture when we take</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.930" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">the the Native American children you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.670" end="00:21:09.170" style="s2">know here in the northwest we we had</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:11.420" style="s2">these forced schooling the residential</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.170" end="00:21:14.030" style="s2">schools in Canada as well horrible</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:17.090" style="s2">horrible so we take them out of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.030" end="00:21:19.130" style="s2">system and you know sometimes people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.090" end="00:21:20.990" style="s2">being cruel right there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.130" end="00:21:22.940" style="s2">absolutely racism and hatred and all</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:25.430" style="s2">these things that are involved but even</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">if it&#39;s well intentioned I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.430" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">what we&#39;re disturbing exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:36.110" style="s2">now so so we see that you know visible</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.950" style="s2">minorities are still suffering in many</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.110" end="00:21:42.950" style="s2">ways right and so now if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.950" end="00:21:45.620" style="s2">the old white agency allows everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.950" end="00:21:49.310" style="s2">achieve civilization it&#39;s kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.620" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">reversed and now it&#39;s white agency</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.310" end="00:21:53.390" style="s2">oppresses everybody right right right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:55.550" style="s2">right right right and I think that um</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:21:58.520" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be entirely dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.550" end="00:22:00.020" style="s2">right but I do think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.520" end="00:22:04.060" style="s2">another way that we can look at this</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.020" end="00:22:04.060" style="s2">which is along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.190" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">cultural change disturbs our meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.980" end="00:22:13.410" style="s2">structures and that&#39;s disruptive for</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:15.090" style="s2">everybody and the bigger your the larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.410" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">the gap that you&#39;re being asked to cross</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.090" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">the harder it&#39;s going to be right so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:23.580" style="s2">many ways what you&#39;re describing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:26.490" style="s2">the meaning crisis is is the disruption</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.580" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">of the underlying cultural Network oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.490" end="00:22:32.610" style="s2">yeah everybody&#39;s suffering from it but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:35.190" style="s2">the people who who the people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.610" end="00:22:38.430" style="s2">been on the hockey stick the longest</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.190" end="00:22:43.140" style="s2">yeah are suffering the least because</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.430" end="00:22:45.870" style="s2">they&#39;re better prepared and and so so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.140" end="00:22:48.090" style="s2">like we are the reason that the that a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:50.760" style="s2">Native American might be suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.090" end="00:22:53.040" style="s2">dama side is actually the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:58.740" style="s2">that so many white kids are committing</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.040" end="00:23:02.670" style="s2">suicide yeah it&#39;s just that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.740" end="00:23:05.250" style="s2">more cultural technology to help us line</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.670" end="00:23:06.330" style="s2">through those waters right right this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.250" end="00:23:08.130" style="s2">kind of the way that I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">about that now this is good I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.130" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">want to unpack this more before we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">but can I just say one more thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:20.040" style="s2">yeah this is the thing actually can I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:21.860" style="s2">tell you a story of course is I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.040" end="00:23:24.840" style="s2">that this is this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.860" end="00:23:26.670" style="s2">so parkour right this is the art that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.840" end="00:23:29.280" style="s2">there was the genesis of this this was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.670" end="00:23:32.190" style="s2">this was an art that was developed by a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.280" end="00:23:35.550" style="s2">by visible minority kids who are largely</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.190" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">the families of immigrants in immigrant</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.550" end="00:23:40.920" style="s2">families in the banlieues of Paris right</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:43.410" style="s2">so a banlieue is is really a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.920" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">this grassy narrows thing right these</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.410" end="00:23:50.070" style="s2">were these houses these you know France</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:51.810" style="s2">- the opposite of North America right</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.070" end="00:23:53.250" style="s2">instead of turning their city centers</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.810" end="00:23:54.570" style="s2">into the housing projects they put the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.250" end="00:23:57.630" style="s2">housing projects on the outskirts of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.570" end="00:24:01.560" style="s2">cities and so you have these massive</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.630" end="00:24:04.110" style="s2">housing developments that are all</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.560" end="00:24:07.050" style="s2">brutalist modern architecture that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.110" end="00:24:10.410" style="s2">absolutely oppressive about people right</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.050" end="00:24:11.880" style="s2">and and everyone was packed in there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.410" end="00:24:13.320" style="s2">this was supposed to be good and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.880" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">everyone was going to develop because</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.320" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">all of the resources worked were tight</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.510" end="00:24:24.990" style="s2">so then you know you have this group of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.320" end="00:24:29.789" style="s2">people from North Africa from West</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.990" end="00:24:32.580" style="s2">Africa and from Vietnam mostly who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.789" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">all coming into to these bamboos in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.580" end="00:24:37.650" style="s2">Paris so the story of parkour you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:39.059" style="s2">the story of get out of Julie angels</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.650" end="00:24:42.360" style="s2">book breaking the jump you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.059" end="00:24:45.750" style="s2">say it starts one starting point is Jana</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.419" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">you&#39;re my friend so they become friends</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:20.750" style="s2">but there&#39;s this intense thing about</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:23.669" style="s2">their friendship right they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.750" end="00:25:26.299" style="s2">really physical kids right they both</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.429" end="00:25:39.510" style="s2">and then David&#39;s cousins get involved</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.649" end="00:25:42.059" style="s2">and then they&#39;re a whole little circle</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.510" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">of friends right and so the there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.429" end="00:26:30.809" style="s2">like david&#39;s father was basically raised</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.309" end="00:26:31.389" style="s2">by the french military after he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.809" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">separated</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.389" end="00:26:39.429" style="s2">from his family mm and a lot of the kids</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:41.169" style="s2">that they grew up with going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.429" end="00:26:43.209" style="s2">gangs going to have all of these you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.169" end="00:26:45.159" style="s2">know be drug addicts you know have all</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.209" end="00:26:46.839" style="s2">the dysfunction that is typical of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.159" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">communities these immigrant compromise</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.839" end="00:26:50.109" style="s2">light communities what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:52.149" style="s2">that I nama saya community right they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.109" end="00:26:54.190" style="s2">came from meaning systems in Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.149" end="00:26:57.309" style="s2">Micronesia in Vietnam that were</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.190" end="00:27:01.329" style="s2">disturbed by war by immigration yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.309" end="00:27:03.849" style="s2">it needs these liminal spaces right</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.329" end="00:27:05.559" style="s2">there were integrated fully into French</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.849" end="00:27:08.889" style="s2">society they were put over there to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.559" end="00:27:11.469" style="s2">of be ignored mm-hmm many people went</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.889" end="00:27:14.349" style="s2">dysfunctional but these kids they found</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.469" end="00:27:17.349" style="s2">somehow if I challenge myself if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.349" end="00:27:19.690" style="s2">burn this energy through through taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.349" end="00:27:21.399" style="s2">on challenge and if I make overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.690" end="00:27:25.570" style="s2">challenges central to Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.399" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">that can help me grow so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.570" end="00:27:32.289" style="s2">a really powerful story and it is and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:35.320" style="s2">was talking to someone who works with</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.289" end="00:27:38.919" style="s2">Alaskan native kids and it struck me</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.320" end="00:27:44.469" style="s2">that often when people are in this this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.919" end="00:27:46.269" style="s2">place between where they&#39;re like it it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.469" end="00:27:50.739" style="s2">can be hot you can be stuck in a place</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.269" end="00:27:54.249" style="s2">where the the arrival of guns and sugar</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.739" end="00:27:56.079" style="s2">and snowmobiles and whatever has in many</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.249" end="00:27:59.559" style="s2">ways made your previous culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.079" end="00:28:01.539" style="s2">technology kind of obsolete right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.559" end="00:28:03.219" style="s2">hard to update too and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.539" end="00:28:05.259" style="s2">this dominant culture over there</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.219" end="00:28:07.329" style="s2">but you don&#39;t feel fully welcomed in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.259" end="00:28:07.779" style="s2">either you put in this liminal place yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.329" end="00:28:09.369" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.779" end="00:28:12.519" style="s2">look in this liminal place and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.369" end="00:28:15.459" style="s2">your identity am i Alaska native or am I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.519" end="00:28:19.899" style="s2">hide or am i you know am i Vietnamese if</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.459" end="00:28:23.499" style="s2">I&#39;m not French and it struck me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.899" end="00:28:25.659" style="s2">that not just parkour but many movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.499" end="00:28:27.609" style="s2">arts and other practices as well but</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.659" end="00:28:29.709" style="s2">they can act as as bridges they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.609" end="00:28:31.779" style="s2">they&#39;re liminal spaces in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.709" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">have an identity that&#39;s shared between</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.779" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">the subculture and the dominant culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:39.339" style="s2">so this this sounds like the argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:41.409" style="s2">I&#39;ve made that you know when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.339" end="00:28:43.239" style="s2">these liminal spaces and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.409" end="00:28:44.360" style="s2">argument right now like Zach Stein is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.239" end="00:28:46.670" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.360" end="00:28:48.860" style="s2">as a whole is in a liminal place right a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.670" end="00:28:51.980" style="s2">lot of people feel that way so sir</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.860" end="00:28:53.950" style="s2">reality is an adjective that comes is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.980" end="00:28:56.780" style="s2">prototypical when people are in liminal</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:28:58.520" style="s2">spaces individual in it and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.780" end="00:29:01.880" style="s2">collectively and I&#39;ve made the argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.520" end="00:29:03.830" style="s2">that and that serious play is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.880" end="00:29:05.809" style="s2">which we learn is in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.830" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">appropriately navigate these liminal</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.809" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">spaces yeah and if we used to have of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">course places of serious play like</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:16.549" style="s2">religious institutions but that largely</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.720" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">collapsed for a lot of people and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.549" end="00:29:20.990" style="s2">sounds to me like the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:23.000" style="s2">talking about the they didn&#39;t turn to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.990" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">religion they turned to something more</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.000" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">primordial in order to reject you Jim</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">and and and Dragon Ball Z martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.919" style="s2">movies and in Raymond so the huge myth</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:39.280" style="s2">which have a huge mythic component to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.919" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">them of course absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.280" end="00:29:42.919" style="s2">but there&#39;s something physical and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:44.750" style="s2">know something that&#39;s been interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.919" end="00:29:47.750" style="s2">to me as I&#39;ve as I&#39;ve explored the space</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.750" end="00:29:50.440" style="s2">of meaning and movement is how</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.750" end="00:29:54.500" style="s2">appropriate is this marriage right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.440" end="00:29:55.880" style="s2">like am I am I getting outside the scope</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.500" end="00:29:58.820" style="s2">of practice of what I should be looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.880" end="00:30:00.440" style="s2">at but when we look back we see that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.820" end="00:30:03.290" style="s2">very frequently in the past these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.440" end="00:30:05.330" style="s2">were very tightly interwoven so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.290" end="00:30:09.380" style="s2">martial arts traditions were developed</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.330" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2">by monks yep very much and you know when</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.380" end="00:30:14.120" style="s2">you practice Tai Chi you&#39;re practicing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.240" end="00:30:16.580" style="s2">Taoist art yes specifically a Taoist art</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.120" end="00:30:20.900" style="s2">or the role of gymnastics in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.580" end="00:30:24.140" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition things or sumo</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.900" end="00:30:26.090" style="s2">sumo is a Sciuto art right all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.140" end="00:30:29.169" style="s2">temples had sumo so this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.090" end="00:30:32.270" style="s2">integration of self transcendence of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.169" end="00:30:35.780" style="s2">spiritual life and a physical expression</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.270" end="00:30:41.960" style="s2">is actually I would say quite native to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.780" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">human beings and I think that um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.960" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:46.460" style="s2">there and and and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:49.450" style="s2">something to me there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.460" end="00:30:53.570" style="s2">powerful about the idea of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.450" end="00:30:57.140" style="s2">if parkour can be a bridge for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.570" end="00:30:58.260" style="s2">immigrant kid to an identity that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.140" end="00:31:01.799" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.260" end="00:31:05.580" style="s2">right and meaningful that helps them</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.799" end="00:31:10.350" style="s2">resolve this tension between you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.580" end="00:31:16.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not fully Vietnamese and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.350" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">fully French in a positive direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.160" end="00:31:21.179" style="s2">these movement practices they can be I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:23.370" style="s2">think they can be they can be these</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.179" end="00:31:25.890" style="s2">identities that help us bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">this sense of domicile that we have in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.890" end="00:31:29.340" style="s2">general in our culture that&#39;s the thesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:31.620" style="s2">I&#39;m working with there&#39;s a good thesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.340" end="00:31:32.549" style="s2">so maybe I can add to it a bit so right</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.620" end="00:31:34.290" style="s2">now you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.549" end="00:31:35.730" style="s2">transformation of identity in the agent</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.290" end="00:31:37.110" style="s2">but it sounds to me I know you&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.730" end="00:31:39.210" style="s2">to me about this before</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.110" end="00:31:42.660" style="s2">parkour is also transforming the arena</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.210" end="00:31:44.910" style="s2">yes or I mean you mentioned how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.660" end="00:31:45.480" style="s2">taking basically there&#39;s brutalist dead</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.910" end="00:31:48.770" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.480" end="00:31:50.520" style="s2">you know landscape and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.770" end="00:31:53.520" style="s2">revitalizing it and they&#39;re turning it</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.520" end="00:31:56.130" style="s2">into an arena that affords them right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.520" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">all kinds of growth and self</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.130" end="00:32:01.230" style="s2">transcendence and connectedness because</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:03.750" style="s2">you know they&#39;re interacting now with</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.230" end="00:32:06.140" style="s2">their their environment is now affording</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.750" end="00:32:08.040" style="s2">them rather than just containing them</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.140" end="00:32:09.720" style="s2">absolutely I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.040" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">interesting from a socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.720" end="00:32:14.910" style="s2">perspective right because where is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:16.380" style="s2">parkour born right kids everywhere all</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.910" end="00:32:17.730" style="s2">over the world have jumped off things</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.380" end="00:32:21.210" style="s2">have flipped off things have done things</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:23.010" style="s2">but it sparks into a thing in this one</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.210" end="00:32:26.210" style="s2">specific into a like a worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.010" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">phenomenon right yo levels explode</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.210" end="00:32:32.490" style="s2">beyond anything we&#39;ve ever seen before</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.710" end="00:32:36.630" style="s2">and it starts in this brutalist and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.490" end="00:32:40.169" style="s2">nightmare in a way right I mean every</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.630" end="00:32:41.460" style="s2">isn&#39;t that terrible but but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.169" end="00:32:42.690" style="s2">something of that and that brutalist</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.460" end="00:32:44.610" style="s2">architecture it&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.690" end="00:32:46.770" style="s2">right like what this architecture you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.610" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">know a lot of people like I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.770" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">horrible to look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:52.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s pretty impressive to be around</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:55.169" style="s2">all the time and it and it was designed</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.140" end="00:32:57.660" style="s2">in a way as like blind to human</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.169" end="00:33:01.080" style="s2">aesthetics yeah yeah like our core kids</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.660" end="00:33:05.669" style="s2">love it it affords tons of movement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.080" end="00:33:09.330" style="s2">yeah yeah we have a brutalist a Lawrence</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.669" end="00:33:11.700" style="s2">Halprin fountain in downtown Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.330" end="00:33:14.510" style="s2">called freeway Park just</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.700" end="00:33:17.490" style="s2">blocks of concrete and it&#39;s world-famous</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.510" end="00:33:19.620" style="s2">right so there&#39;s something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.490" end="00:33:21.750" style="s2">interesting about that about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.620" end="00:33:23.130" style="s2">that you know I talked about this I</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.750" end="00:33:26.549" style="s2">think in our last podcast but this idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.130" end="00:33:28.830" style="s2">that III when I first encountered the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.549" end="00:33:31.049" style="s2">the kind of Peter Sounion perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.830" end="00:33:32.610" style="s2">was like odd the breaking the jump like</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.049" end="00:33:35.399" style="s2">the process of going out and finding a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.610" end="00:33:39.330" style="s2">jump that&#39;s a mini hero&#39;s journey for</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.399" end="00:33:42.450" style="s2">your your you&#39;re looking at the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.330" end="00:33:45.450" style="s2">around you you&#39;re finding a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.450" end="00:33:48.299" style="s2">chaos basically and then you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.450" end="00:33:50.250" style="s2">order to it through overcoming it but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.299" end="00:33:54.179" style="s2">was only more recently that I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.250" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">that that that it&#39;s actually also the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.179" end="00:33:57.419" style="s2">inverse of that aspect of the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:59.639" style="s2">journey because the opposite side of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.419" end="00:34:01.710" style="s2">of the confrontation with chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.639" end="00:34:03.899" style="s2">stagnation of order and the need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.710" end="00:34:08.700" style="s2">bring cast back into the system the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.899" end="00:34:10.200" style="s2">the waters of life and so what what what</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.700" end="00:34:12.419" style="s2">those Park were kids had done was they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.200" end="00:34:13.980" style="s2">hadn&#39;t just imagined themselves as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.419" end="00:34:15.929" style="s2">type of person who can who can confront</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.980" end="00:34:17.849" style="s2">something they&#39;d imagined the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.929" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">environment as suddenly containing all</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.849" end="00:34:22.950" style="s2">of these potentials all these anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:26.310" style="s2">and we&#39;re not previously there yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.950" end="00:34:29.069" style="s2">yeah yeah created they created a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.310" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">entirely new agent arena relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.069" end="00:34:34.379" style="s2">reciprocal opening in a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:35.940" style="s2">way very very powerfully yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.379" end="00:34:39.750" style="s2">they&#39;re integrating mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.940" end="00:34:43.500" style="s2">together and then they&#39;re reintegrating</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.750" end="00:34:46.889" style="s2">right in an enacted imaginal way the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.500" end="00:34:49.230" style="s2">arena and the agent and in getting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.889" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">reciprocal opening mm-hmm and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.230" end="00:34:54.929" style="s2">have had the idea of taking that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:56.369" style="s2">then situating it in nature as adding an</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.929" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">increased dimension could you unpack</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.369" end="00:35:02.520" style="s2">that a bit please</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:04.050" style="s2">yeah I mean on one level I say I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.520" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">that what happened for me is I just was</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.050" end="00:35:07.290" style="s2">akin you grew up in nature and was</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">attracted to it and that I had to stack</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.290" end="00:35:10.950" style="s2">these things all right from another</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.810" end="00:35:13.770" style="s2">perspective the way that I&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.950" end="00:35:17.790" style="s2">well actually let me back up for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.770" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">second or part those kids who grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.790" end="00:35:22.950" style="s2">France and started this they trained in</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:24.980" style="s2">nature and in the city oh I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.950" end="00:35:26.570" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.980" end="00:35:28.310" style="s2">yeah if you go to the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.570" end="00:35:29.869" style="s2">interviews with David Bell he says you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.310" end="00:35:31.430" style="s2">know whether in the man-made or the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.869" end="00:35:33.560" style="s2">natural environment and the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.430" end="00:35:37.130" style="s2">videos they feature every and lease</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.560" end="00:35:39.740" style="s2">which are families outside Paris but</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.130" end="00:35:42.760" style="s2">they also feature source cells which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.740" end="00:35:45.050" style="s2">a rural area that his cousins lived in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.760" end="00:35:47.030" style="s2">and they feature Fontainebleau</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.050" end="00:35:50.690" style="s2">this is kind of a really funny piece of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.030" end="00:35:52.609" style="s2">history but lease and every which are</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.690" end="00:35:54.099" style="s2">the birthing grounds of parkour are</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.609" end="00:35:56.329" style="s2">about 20 minutes by car from</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.099" end="00:35:59.660" style="s2">Fontainebleau which is where the modern</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.329" end="00:36:01.849" style="s2">sport of bouldering was developed the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.660" end="00:36:03.380" style="s2">modern sport of what bouldering so</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.849" end="00:36:04.940" style="s2">bouldering and parkour are basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.380" end="00:36:05.780" style="s2">born 20 minutes away from each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.940" end="00:36:09.349" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.780" end="00:36:11.390" style="s2">what&#39;s bouldering rock climbing so</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.349" end="00:36:13.099" style="s2">traditionally of mountaineering and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:14.359" style="s2">mountaineering gives rise to rock</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.099" end="00:36:17.329" style="s2">climbing where you&#39;re just focused on</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.359" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">going up faces but you do ropes right</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.329" end="00:36:21.890" style="s2">then you go big faces and then people</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.690" style="s2">start training to be better at doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.890" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">that by just climbing boulders where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.690" end="00:36:28.609" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be roped in</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:31.160" style="s2">oh wow yeah these kittens all over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.609" end="00:36:33.260" style="s2">world now where you have rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.160" end="00:36:34.760" style="s2">holds on walls that are Boulder problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.260" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">so the distinction between bouldering</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.760" end="00:36:39.619" style="s2">and rock climbing is generally that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:41.480" style="s2">rock climbing you are roped in right</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.619" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">ring you&#39;re just you&#39;re just finding</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:46.069" style="s2">these problems so that that separates</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.180" end="00:36:49.190" style="s2">out in a lot of ways in Fontainebleau</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.069" end="00:36:52.430" style="s2">so anyway so they&#39;re there and then in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.190" end="00:36:52.970" style="s2">the in the documentary generation you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:54.619" style="s2">know mikaze</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.970" end="00:36:56.569" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember which one of it is but</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.619" end="00:36:59.540" style="s2">one of the other founders she says um</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.569" end="00:37:02.690" style="s2">the the body of parkour is born in every</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.540" end="00:37:04.910" style="s2">which is urban but the spirit is born of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.690" end="00:37:06.859" style="s2">importance ourselves all right so they</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.910" end="00:37:09.140" style="s2">found things that would transfer between</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.859" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">the two and flow with abuse they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.140" end="00:37:13.250" style="s2">there with both but now an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:16.609" style="s2">thing happened when it went hot when it</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.250" end="00:37:18.650" style="s2">went international it became very</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.609" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">strongly associated with just the urban</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.650" end="00:37:23.690" style="s2">environment Oh what would call it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.359" style="s2">fervent obstacle course and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.690" end="00:37:29.150" style="s2">part of this may have been that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.359" end="00:37:30.890" style="s2">earliest popularizers in the UK the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.150" end="00:37:32.450" style="s2">urban free flow group they were called</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.890" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">urban free flow there&#39;s a start right</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.450" end="00:37:36.829" style="s2">this was the first big group and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">first big website for parkour was urban</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.829" end="00:37:41.030" style="s2">free flow and they they did</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.170" end="00:37:42.380" style="s2">have a really good understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.030" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">was happening with the French guys they</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.380" end="00:37:46.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t have access to them they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:48.080" style="s2">speak the language there was not a there</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.580" end="00:37:50.750" style="s2">was not good you know communication</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.080" end="00:37:53.300" style="s2">between these two areas and urban free</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.750" end="00:37:56.810" style="s2">flow in a lot of ways modeled parkour as</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.300" end="00:37:58.330" style="s2">kind of like skateboarding is very</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.810" end="00:38:01.550" style="s2">strongly associated with the urban train</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.330" end="00:38:04.190" style="s2">so anyways so is it&#39;s not original to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.550" end="00:38:05.570" style="s2">to take parkour into two nature but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.190" end="00:38:06.950" style="s2">way that I looked at it was that these</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.570" end="00:38:09.470" style="s2">physical capacities that we were</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.950" end="00:38:11.570" style="s2">exploring in the city they evolved in</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.470" end="00:38:14.570" style="s2">the natural environment these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.570" end="00:38:17.030" style="s2">because we have we have we have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.570" end="00:38:20.090" style="s2">heritage as tree climbing animals kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.030" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">of a very basic level and I felt that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.090" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">there was something deeper that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.060" style="s2">learned that her that I got when I went</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.190" style="s2">into nature that there was more</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.060" end="00:38:29.870" style="s2">information in nature and it was a more</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.190" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">powerful trigger for the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.870" end="00:38:36.950" style="s2">right and then it was kind of there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:38.510" style="s2">let&#39;s say there&#39;s I think parkour in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.950" end="00:38:43.490" style="s2">some sense is like a radical reimagining</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.510" end="00:38:47.870" style="s2">of the urban world as available for play</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.490" end="00:38:50.450" style="s2">like the tree within the building right</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.870" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">yeah I like that that&#39;s when you go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.450" end="00:38:56.390" style="s2">to nature you&#39;re actually you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">recovering the place where that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.390" end="00:38:59.930" style="s2">actually more intuitive and more natural</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:02.360" style="s2">so you&#39;re probably tapping into some</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.930" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">deep evolutionary machinery would really</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.360" end="00:39:07.850" style="s2">be conducive to getting people feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:11.420" style="s2">very connected yeah and then then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.850" end="00:39:13.550" style="s2">find that he naturally brings in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.420" end="00:39:15.560" style="s2">that curiosity about connection to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.550" end="00:39:20.510" style="s2">nature in a broader way right that a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.560" end="00:39:25.100" style="s2">tree as a living thing it invites a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.510" end="00:39:27.590" style="s2">curiosity about it right that is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.100" end="00:39:29.750" style="s2">different from a building so does that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.590" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">mean it&#39;s easy then I&#39;m trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.750" end="00:39:33.800" style="s2">sense because unfortunately I have not</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.970" end="00:39:35.360" style="s2">been able to come to you&#39;ve invited me</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.800" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">up for health reasons I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.360" end="00:39:41.630" style="s2">able to come I hope that changes someday</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:43.850" style="s2">so I&#39;m getting like people are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.630" end="00:39:45.860" style="s2">parkour and then you have the practice I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.850" end="00:39:47.570" style="s2">forget what you call it where you people</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.860" end="00:39:50.510" style="s2">are sitting and they&#39;re basically doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.570" end="00:39:51.620" style="s2">a contemplative practice like on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.510" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">natural environment what&#39;s it called</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.620" end="00:39:58.610" style="s2">again sits</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:40:02.150" style="s2">yes we get from from from the John Young</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.610" end="00:40:03.860" style="s2">wilderness awareness tradition but it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.150" end="00:40:09.500" style="s2">a contemplative practice where you learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.860" end="00:40:11.360" style="s2">to to essentially attend to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.500" end="00:40:13.730" style="s2">information coming at you from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.360" end="00:40:15.740" style="s2">landscape so you&#39;re really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.730" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">attune to it very deeply so that would</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.740" end="00:40:18.980" style="s2">of course create a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:21.290" style="s2">connectedness do you find that it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.980" end="00:40:23.210" style="s2">like these I mean I understand that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.290" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">sort of evolved very organically for you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.210" end="00:40:27.290" style="s2">but these are these practices have all</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:29.750" style="s2">been chosen also it sounds like because</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.290" end="00:40:31.730" style="s2">they they sort of like it&#39;s eat like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.750" end="00:40:33.260" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for people to move from one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.730" end="00:40:35.300" style="s2">these practices to another they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.260" end="00:40:37.340" style="s2">naturally afford and complement each</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.300" end="00:40:42.430" style="s2">other is that is that correct yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.340" end="00:40:47.450" style="s2">mean that&#39;s not so much intentional</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.430" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">emergent right it&#39;s like I have a base</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.450" end="00:40:53.150" style="s2">practice let&#39;s say yeah or core and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:55.580" style="s2">parkour in nature and then and then I go</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.150" end="00:40:57.410" style="s2">out and I find all these things and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.580" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">some of them stick and adhere to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.410" end="00:41:05.390" style="s2">yeah yeah and and so sit spotting has</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:10.130" style="s2">been really wonderful and and then also</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.390" end="00:41:11.660" style="s2">like I like focus meditation body</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.130" end="00:41:13.060" style="s2">scanning meditations and Metta</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.660" end="00:41:17.450" style="s2">meditations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:21.020" style="s2">romantic contemplations as as adjuncts</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.450" end="00:41:22.970" style="s2">to this yeah I can see that and then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.020" end="00:41:24.620" style="s2">also get like a campfire practice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.970" end="00:41:26.270" style="s2">very similar to some of the stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.620" end="00:41:27.590" style="s2">trying to do with dialectic and dialogo</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.270" end="00:41:31.310" style="s2">so although right now we&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.590" end="00:41:32.120" style="s2">digital campfires instead where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.310" end="00:41:33.860" style="s2">getting something like an</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.120" end="00:41:36.410" style="s2">intersubjective like you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.860" end="00:41:41.210" style="s2">narrative and and people are literally</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.410" end="00:41:42.860" style="s2">circling around a campfire yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.210" end="00:41:44.950" style="s2">after my encounter soon with with Peter</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.860" end="00:41:47.630" style="s2">after my encounter with Peterson&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.950" end="00:41:51.650" style="s2">at the end of our seminars even then on</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.630" end="00:41:53.270" style="s2">retreats well I got the end of this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.650" end="00:41:56.810" style="s2">first day I would tell one of the Dragon</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.270" end="00:41:58.010" style="s2">stories yeah then I would ask people</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.810" end="00:42:00.200" style="s2">like why would I tell a story like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.010" end="00:42:02.780" style="s2">had a memory tree what does this have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.200" end="00:42:04.940" style="s2">do with like being able to jump or do</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.780" end="00:42:06.200" style="s2">vaults and and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.940" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">have a discussion about it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.200" end="00:42:11.030" style="s2">I reveal that for me fundamentally the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:13.400" style="s2">Dragons story was was a was an archetype</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.030" end="00:42:16.339" style="s2">of representation of the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.400" end="00:42:20.030" style="s2">and that that that our movement practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.339" end="00:42:21.859" style="s2">was a way in which we could we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.030" end="00:42:24.579" style="s2">intentionally go into that and then when</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.859" end="00:42:26.750" style="s2">we saw it that way we could start to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.579" end="00:42:29.150" style="s2">generalize the insights from that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.750" end="00:42:30.230" style="s2">process more effectively into the rest</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.150" end="00:42:32.030" style="s2">of our life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.230" end="00:42:34.040" style="s2">always the always the intent to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.030" end="00:42:35.750" style="s2">integrate with with your life so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.040" end="00:42:37.819" style="s2">supposed to be life transformative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.750" end="00:42:40.940" style="s2">not a vacation it&#39;s not a retreat in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.819" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">that sense yeah so let me let me tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.940" end="00:42:43.339" style="s2">you this degree because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.079" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">important like we&#39;ve talked about this a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.339" end="00:42:47.060" style="s2">little bit before but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:52.010" style="s2">really important you know thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.060" end="00:42:53.480" style="s2">those original guys you know so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.010" end="00:42:54.710" style="s2">were all training and they were training</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.480" end="00:42:56.690" style="s2">intensely and they felt that it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.710" end="00:42:58.010" style="s2">transforming them right and they were</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:42:59.270" style="s2">they were doing just physical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.010" end="00:43:01.069" style="s2">they&#39;re doing martial arts but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.270" end="00:43:03.079" style="s2">started doing these jumps and the jumps</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.069" end="00:43:07.880" style="s2">seem to be unique right jumping between</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.079" end="00:43:08.780" style="s2">buildings jumping at height and when one</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.880" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">of the guys is considered one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">founders Williams he&#39;s much younger he</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:16.280" style="s2">was only six years old when this process</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:18.290" style="s2">started when he&#39;s 11 years old he he he</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.280" end="00:43:20.390" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of training with like the baby</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.290" end="00:43:22.250" style="s2">group right there&#39;s the older kids and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.390" end="00:43:24.619" style="s2">there&#39;s him and he gets to stagger along</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.250" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">sometimes but not all the time and he uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.619" end="00:43:29.240" style="s2">he sees this jump that the older kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">have done right and he works up to and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.240" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">he finally does it and it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:36.440" style="s2">profound transformation for him and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">he he he asked one of his friends to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.440" end="00:43:39.800" style="s2">come and do it and his friend does it</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:42.050" style="s2">and as his friend lands it comes down</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.800" end="00:43:43.880" style="s2">Williams has the sense that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.050" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">that jump had meant to him it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.880" end="00:43:50.660" style="s2">have the same impact on his friend and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:52.970" style="s2">that that he at 11 he seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.660" end="00:43:54.530" style="s2">realized that that the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.970" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">mattered wasn&#39;t the jump it was the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.530" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">that it transformed and so there&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">there&#39;s so what I&#39;m noticed over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:10.030" style="s2">years is that every practice that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:16.520" style="s2">hear people raving about is is a tool</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.030" end="00:44:18.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a hole right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.520" end="00:44:21.410" style="s2">it affords</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.050" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">or it affords or affords transformation</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.410" end="00:44:29.570" style="s2">or it affords hiding right so so you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2">you can go to a jump because you learn</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.570" end="00:44:34.610" style="s2">something and then you take that insight</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.340" end="00:44:36.140" style="s2">into your life or once you become</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.610" end="00:44:38.030" style="s2">comfortable with the jumps and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.140" end="00:44:40.070" style="s2">like you have that catharsis and a sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.030" end="00:44:42.320" style="s2">of having overcome something that can</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.070" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">become your place to get that so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.320" end="00:44:46.370" style="s2">you can avoid facing all the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:47.810" style="s2">places in your life that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.370" end="00:44:49.730" style="s2">that&#39;s an important difference the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.810" end="00:44:51.650" style="s2">Buddha talked similarly I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.730" end="00:44:53.000" style="s2">about this you know when the classes</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.650" end="00:44:56.180" style="s2">about you know people who are using</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.000" end="00:44:58.790" style="s2">meditation and contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.180" end="00:45:01.220" style="s2">in order to you know pursue awakening</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.790" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">versus those who are trying to hide from</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.220" end="00:45:07.370" style="s2">the world and try to become content and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:08.690" style="s2">feel like yes very very much I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.370" end="00:45:10.430" style="s2">exactly the same thing in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.690" end="00:45:12.980" style="s2">where where there are there are people</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.430" end="00:45:15.020" style="s2">whose meditation practice opens the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.980" end="00:45:16.940" style="s2">world to them just people who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.020" end="00:45:19.130" style="s2">meditation practice becomes a place to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.940" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">avoid the world so I have this slogan I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.130" end="00:45:22.490" style="s2">often use when I&#39;m teaching my students</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:25.550" style="s2">and I have used it in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.490" end="00:45:27.860" style="s2">meditation class I&#39;m doing online I say</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.550" end="00:45:32.210" style="s2">that medic that I say meditation is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.860" end="00:45:36.350" style="s2">education it is never a vacation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.210" end="00:45:37.490" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re trying to bring that so do so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.350" end="00:45:39.710" style="s2">when people are talking around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.490" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">campfire I&#39;m just interested does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.710" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">mean that they sort of start to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:47.060" style="s2">on not the event itself I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna talk about the events of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.060" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">their day they&#39;re human beings</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:52.520" style="s2">but part of what happening there is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:54.890" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re reflecting on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.520" end="00:45:56.330" style="s2">transformative meaning itself and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.890" end="00:45:58.100" style="s2">there&#39;s discussion about that does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.330" end="00:46:06.920" style="s2">come out yeah so the campfire in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.100" end="00:46:09.650" style="s2">practice so so a lot of this thing again</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.920" end="00:46:11.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s emergent right no I get it</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.650" end="00:46:13.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a work in progress but this was</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.660" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">great yeah yeah so you can&#39;t you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.550" end="00:46:17.120" style="s2">camping right you don&#39;t know why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:18.770" style="s2">just camping in some sense so that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.120" end="00:46:21.020" style="s2">people you have a place to keep people</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.770" end="00:46:22.490" style="s2">so that they can then go do stuff they</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.020" end="00:46:23.870" style="s2">teach them but it&#39;s not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.490" end="00:46:27.950" style="s2">teaching it&#39;s just the hanging out after</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.870" end="00:46:30.110" style="s2">right that&#39;s the way it is so then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.950" end="00:46:31.790" style="s2">know we go from three days and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.110" end="00:46:34.150" style="s2">great and then we go to five days</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.790" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">and the year that we went to five days I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.150" end="00:46:41.600" style="s2">contracted Lyme disease teaching in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:44.210" style="s2">Denmark Oh so on the third day of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.600" end="00:46:46.970" style="s2">seminar I hit the cycle of the Lyme</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.210" end="00:46:52.100" style="s2">disease and I was puking and feverish</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.970" end="00:46:56.180" style="s2">and all of this stuff oh and we had so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.100" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">let I Kyle my the teacher I mentioned he</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.180" end="00:46:58.580" style="s2">was a wilderness awareness school</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.170" style="s2">teacher I left him in charge and went</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.580" end="00:47:02.780" style="s2">and spent the night at my mom&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.170" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t camp all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.780" end="00:47:09.590" style="s2">and that night they played songs we had</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:11.690" style="s2">we had two couple of East those who were</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.590" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">playing couple Wed up music and then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.690" end="00:47:15.890" style="s2">had another person who has songs and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:17.720" style="s2">there was this there is this something</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.890" end="00:47:21.410" style="s2">had happened when I came back to teach</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.720" end="00:47:24.230" style="s2">the next day oh I see and the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.410" end="00:47:26.540" style="s2">were a tribe in a way that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.230" end="00:47:29.090" style="s2">experienced before and it was in deeply</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.540" end="00:47:32.270" style="s2">deeply meaningful to them that was in</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.090" end="00:47:33.470" style="s2">2016 so the next year we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.270" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">recapture it and it was still strong but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.470" end="00:47:38.330" style="s2">it was a quite a strong right and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">then we start thinking well what is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.330" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">is this is this isn&#39;t just this song</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:45.500" style="s2">thing or this campfire time thing is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">just it&#39;s not just a place for me to</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.500" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">give a lecture all right it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:53.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not just recreation time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.540" end="00:47:58.700" style="s2">actually part of the transformation yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.900" end="00:48:00.680" style="s2">last year we I went did Mark Wallace</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.700" end="00:48:03.230" style="s2">commercial friend mark Walsh&#39;s he white</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.680" end="00:48:05.840" style="s2">key word and he taught me this technique</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.230" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">of having people stop after a certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.840" end="00:48:12.650" style="s2">period of time training training a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">movement practice and have them do a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.650" end="00:48:15.230" style="s2">dialog in practice where they speak for</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">one minute about what their core</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.230" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">insights were so it&#39;s an insight farming</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.180" end="00:48:21.590" style="s2">practice right right and so so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.390" end="00:48:24.050" style="s2">started introducing that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.590" end="00:48:25.360" style="s2">introduced the idea of asking the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.050" end="00:48:27.530" style="s2">students to tell their story and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.360" end="00:48:30.320" style="s2">introducing you know this has happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.530" end="00:48:31.460" style="s2">over time and and and and the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.320" end="00:48:34.340" style="s2">that have come out you know we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.460" end="00:48:36.110" style="s2">people share some incredibly deep stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.340" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">some traumas that you know people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.110" end="00:48:41.990" style="s2">never shared outside of that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:44.300" style="s2">incredible incredible conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.990" end="00:48:44.690" style="s2">people people who&#39;ve come to our</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.300" end="00:48:46.849" style="s2">workshop</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.690" end="00:48:48.230" style="s2">now they&#39;re they&#39;re you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.849" end="00:48:50.690" style="s2">staying in contact even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.230" end="00:48:53.000" style="s2">yeah all over the country because</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.690" end="00:48:54.890" style="s2">they&#39;re they have this this group of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.000" end="00:48:56.540" style="s2">people who they trust and they can</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.890" end="00:48:58.700" style="s2">communicate with in a way that very few</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.540" end="00:49:01.069" style="s2">people are available to them so you sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.700" end="00:49:01.849" style="s2">of retooled the I think that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.069" end="00:49:05.750" style="s2">word to use here</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.849" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">you retooled the the campfires to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.750" end="00:49:13.099" style="s2">sort of you know insight and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:15.319" style="s2">transformation yes metric and that sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.099" end="00:49:17.540" style="s2">of caught that and that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.319" end="00:49:18.619" style="s2">recapture what it spontaneously happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.540" end="00:49:20.210" style="s2">when you were sick is that what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.619" end="00:49:23.540" style="s2">found yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.210" end="00:49:26.540" style="s2">so we so we so we use music so we teach</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.540" end="00:49:28.609" style="s2">songs we use storytelling I tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.540" end="00:49:33.170" style="s2">but we also asked the students to tell</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.609" end="00:49:35.060" style="s2">stories we did this we did this this</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.170" end="00:49:36.410" style="s2">this last retreat that we did for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.060" end="00:49:39.230" style="s2">first time where we asked the students</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.410" end="00:49:41.510" style="s2">to get together in groups and compose a</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.230" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">narrative myth basically I of their</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.510" end="00:49:47.180" style="s2">experience at the event and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:52.010" style="s2">presented to the group their insights</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.180" end="00:49:54.560" style="s2">from the practice around the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.010" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">not as much just around the insights</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.560" end="00:49:58.130" style="s2">from the data it&#39;s kind of summed up at</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:50:00.440" style="s2">the end of the day right so we so after</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.130" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">each section we have a sit down and dial</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.440" end="00:50:04.190" style="s2">so you have a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:05.480" style="s2">practices that I see and then mention</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.190" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">you also and I&#39;ve seen a couple of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.480" end="00:50:13.339" style="s2">videos you also do some lectures and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:15.380" style="s2">and what they play in all of this so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.339" end="00:50:18.560" style="s2">idea of the lecture is to give the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.380" end="00:50:20.119" style="s2">philosophical framework right behind it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.560" end="00:50:22.700" style="s2">and the science behind it to justify</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.119" end="00:50:25.369" style="s2">them right it&#39;s it&#39;s like here&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.700" end="00:50:26.780" style="s2">your justification for the practice and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.369" end="00:50:29.089" style="s2">you give people insight into how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.780" end="00:50:35.510" style="s2">can continue practicing and then those</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.089" end="00:50:38.329" style="s2">also form they form a they form a</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.510" end="00:50:39.050" style="s2">foundation for continued dialogues right</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.329" end="00:50:40.940" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.050" end="00:50:42.920" style="s2">so you&#39;re providing kind of a what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.940" end="00:50:44.390" style="s2">often call a conceptual grammar for</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.920" end="00:50:47.930" style="s2">people yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.390" end="00:50:49.819" style="s2">so I mean you&#39;re my friend so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.930" end="00:50:54.230" style="s2">mean this is a complicated we invented</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.819" end="00:50:56.569" style="s2">church like but but but but maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.230" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">maybe or maybe something you know proto</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.569" end="00:50:59.570" style="s2">church that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">you know more present in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.570" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies but you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:04.630" style="s2">invented a lot of the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">religion is what I&#39;m trying to say I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.630" end="00:51:10.580" style="s2">mean that&#39;s I think that&#39;s true and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:13.130" style="s2">also find it uncomfortable I like I know</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.580" end="00:51:16.010" style="s2">you do you know I&#39;m not trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.130" end="00:51:17.810" style="s2">make friends well it&#39;s it&#39;s a funny</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.010" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">thing so you know when we started</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.810" end="00:51:22.970" style="s2">parkour like we were all like you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:25.400" style="s2">like my nickname was like the parkour</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.970" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">preacher right yeah he was like it I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.400" end="00:51:30.890" style="s2">could quote David Bell right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:33.980" style="s2">David Bell of 2028 right um please does</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.890" end="00:51:35.390" style="s2">this and and and it was like a religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.980" end="00:51:37.970" style="s2">transformation for those of us in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.390" end="00:51:39.230" style="s2">beginning right it was like something</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.970" end="00:51:40.700" style="s2">had come into our lives that have</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.230" end="00:51:41.810" style="s2">completely changed us and that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.700" end="00:51:46.940" style="s2">profound and we wanted to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.810" end="00:51:49.910" style="s2">share it proselytize innocence and but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.940" end="00:51:51.770" style="s2">then there was it was like I think there</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.910" end="00:51:54.320" style="s2">are people for whom the movement kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.770" end="00:51:57.500" style="s2">self organizes the understanding at</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.320" end="00:51:59.690" style="s2">least sufficiently but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.500" end="00:52:01.700" style="s2">sufficient level of kind of depth when</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.690" end="00:52:03.080" style="s2">you&#39;re 21 and a different level of depth</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.700" end="00:52:05.060" style="s2">that you need as you continue that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.080" end="00:52:09.110" style="s2">process to have it continue to give</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.060" end="00:52:11.090" style="s2">meaning to you as you age but but my</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.110" end="00:52:12.830" style="s2">business partner was always joking that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.090" end="00:52:16.580" style="s2">we should just rebrand parkour as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.830" end="00:52:20.210" style="s2">church so that we can get free taxes but</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.580" end="00:52:23.600" style="s2">then but then but also I wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.210" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">that uh one of our students at at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.600" end="00:52:27.560" style="s2">retreat you know you know was talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.240" style="s2">about how special that retreat was he</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.560" end="00:52:31.810" style="s2">was like you know what it brought him</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.240" end="00:52:36.070" style="s2">back to his church camp right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.810" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">like going out and he tells the story of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.070" end="00:52:40.100" style="s2">basically like a friend I think that one</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:41.270" style="s2">of their when they went on this long</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.100" end="00:52:43.100" style="s2">hike and someone actually sprained their</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.270" end="00:52:45.140" style="s2">ankle and they had to carry them back</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.100" end="00:52:47.930" style="s2">and then they had to like take them on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.140" end="00:52:49.550" style="s2">canoe across a lake with like high chop</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.930" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">in the middle of the night to like get</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.550" end="00:52:51.890" style="s2">them back and get them treatment now</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:53.150" style="s2">this was like one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.890" end="00:52:54.260" style="s2">transformative experience of his life</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.150" end="00:52:56.600" style="s2">when there&#39;s a dirty mural</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.260" end="00:52:58.340" style="s2">so in some sense we&#39;re really clearing</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.600" end="00:53:00.890" style="s2">that and I think that you know what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.340" end="00:53:04.010" style="s2">talked about you before is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.890" end="00:53:05.900" style="s2">if you can if you like I&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.010" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">accept that to a degree right that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.900" end="00:53:10.820" style="s2">the spirituality and and physical</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:11.269" style="s2">practice can and maybe need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.820" end="00:53:15.649" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.269" end="00:53:17.479" style="s2">a sort of dynamic yeah they&#39;re wedded</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.649" end="00:53:19.640" style="s2">together they fought each other in</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.479" end="00:53:22.069" style="s2">powerful wills and then and then at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.640" end="00:53:25.279" style="s2">same time I don&#39;t want to you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.069" end="00:53:27.169" style="s2">tell I tell tell stories that I got from</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.279" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">Peterson and I talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.169" end="00:53:31.069" style="s2">relationship to the Christ archetype but</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.859" style="s2">I always tell people like I&#39;m I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.069" end="00:53:35.749" style="s2">I&#39;m not a devout Christian I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.859" end="00:53:37.849" style="s2">asking you to be to get the meaning out</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.749" end="00:53:38.899" style="s2">of this like I think that one of my</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.849" end="00:53:40.789" style="s2">favorite things that you say is they had</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.899" end="00:53:43.339" style="s2">be able religion without a religion or I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.789" end="00:53:45.199" style="s2">like you to think of as religio yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.339" end="00:53:47.089" style="s2">very much it doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.199" end="00:53:48.380" style="s2">have it right like if you want to if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.089" end="00:53:49.699" style="s2">if you&#39;re a devout Christian you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.380" end="00:53:51.049" style="s2">welcome if you&#39;re a devout Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.699" end="00:53:52.179" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome fueled about Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.049" end="00:53:55.009" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.179" end="00:53:57.429" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s machinery within</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.009" end="00:54:00.679" style="s2">religion that that is deeply necessary</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.429" end="00:54:02.569" style="s2">but my approach to that is definitely I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.679" end="00:54:04.339" style="s2">think it would be the service to what</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.569" end="00:54:06.439" style="s2">we&#39;re offering if it became too attached</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.339" end="00:54:08.299" style="s2">to that well you don&#39;t attach it to any</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.439" end="00:54:10.789" style="s2">particular religion and all right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.299" end="00:54:12.140" style="s2">like I said I think it&#39;s I of course I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.789" end="00:54:14.869" style="s2">was teasing you about to try and poke</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.140" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">you yeah I think it is much more about I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.869" end="00:54:19.869" style="s2">mean you&#39;re creating you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:23.149" style="s2">creating in these terms I mean seriously</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.869" end="00:54:24.949" style="s2">you&#39;re creating ritual and mythos for</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.149" end="00:54:26.989" style="s2">enhancing religio and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.949" end="00:54:29.209" style="s2">really really important within an</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.989" end="00:54:33.859" style="s2">aspirational program of trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.209" end="00:54:35.659" style="s2">people wiser more connected yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.859" end="00:54:38.269" style="s2">is cool and it&#39;s funny because now it</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.659" end="00:54:40.609" style="s2">affords me talking to you all right but</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.269" end="00:54:43.549" style="s2">I just fell into it right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.609" end="00:54:47.779" style="s2">funny thing about it anyway yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.549" end="00:54:52.249" style="s2">mean I mean it&#39;s funny but it&#39;s also it</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.779" end="00:54:54.349" style="s2">also it also sorry I don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.249" end="00:54:57.679" style="s2">this self-serving but it legitimates</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.349" end="00:55:00.649" style="s2">or at least provides evidence for an</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.679" end="00:55:04.429" style="s2">argument I&#39;ve been making about a how</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.649" end="00:55:06.949" style="s2">how this is fundamental to us and how</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.429" end="00:55:08.839" style="s2">this can be built bottom-up it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.949" end="00:55:11.269" style="s2">have to be belief centric you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.839" end="00:55:13.639" style="s2">come in with this whole metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.269" end="00:55:16.819" style="s2">belief structure in order to create a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.639" end="00:55:19.399" style="s2">mythos and a set of rituals that afford</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.819" end="00:55:21.619" style="s2">the enhancement of religion and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.399" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">transformation of agent arena you just</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.619" end="00:55:25.029" style="s2">just emerged and yet it&#39;s effective and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:29.140" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.029" end="00:55:32.949" style="s2">powerful yeah yeah it emerged in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.140" end="00:55:34.599" style="s2">sense despite me well but in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.949" end="00:55:36.249" style="s2">ways in the beginning of this process I</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.599" end="00:55:37.719" style="s2">would describe myself is a very hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.249" end="00:55:42.189" style="s2">line atheist and yeah extremely</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.719" end="00:55:46.630" style="s2">skeptical of religion and and and also</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.189" end="00:55:48.969" style="s2">like I always say that I had to be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.630" end="00:55:50.919" style="s2">little bit of a lone wolf personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.969" end="00:55:51.969" style="s2">wise in order to go into this place that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.919" end="00:55:54.039" style="s2">nobody else was there</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.969" end="00:55:56.409" style="s2">well of course I get that I get that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.039" end="00:55:59.409" style="s2">snow the the creation of the community</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.409" end="00:56:00.699" style="s2">has been so much a self-organization of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.409" end="00:56:04.089" style="s2">the people who&#39;ve taken on the work</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.699" end="00:56:06.039" style="s2">around me yeah yeah just an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.089" end="00:56:09.609" style="s2">yeah that logo so I love that I love</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.039" end="00:56:11.619" style="s2">that so I you I mean you did this</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.609" end="00:56:14.049" style="s2">spontaneously in a couple of other other</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.619" end="00:56:15.939" style="s2">dialogues you know I I now hear you sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.049" end="00:56:19.119" style="s2">of self described as a non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.939" end="00:56:27.609" style="s2">so there has been a shift for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.119" end="00:56:29.439" style="s2">I mean you know encountering Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.609" end="00:56:31.479" style="s2">work was it was really was really</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.439" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">powerful to me and it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.479" end="00:56:35.259" style="s2">confusing because I knew that I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:37.390" style="s2">looking for a narrative but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.259" end="00:56:39.099" style="s2">understand quite why I was so obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.390" end="00:56:41.380" style="s2">with it and while I was taking my time</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.099" end="00:56:43.509" style="s2">away from studying more specific stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.380" end="00:56:48.849" style="s2">around physiology and adaption to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.509" end="00:56:50.169" style="s2">exercise and no motor learning and I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.849" end="00:56:54.159" style="s2">like why am i studying this guy&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.169" end="00:56:58.809" style="s2">so much but but yeah it was profound and</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.159" end="00:57:00.039" style="s2">and I I you know I remember when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.809" end="00:57:01.089" style="s2">heard the biblical series I told my wife</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.039" end="00:57:04.779" style="s2">like I might be a Christian when the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.089" end="00:57:06.519" style="s2">sense yeah but I wasn&#39;t you know I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.779" end="00:57:10.179" style="s2">love the stories and I love the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.519" end="00:57:11.619" style="s2">and in his per its profoundly shifted</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.179" end="00:57:14.529" style="s2">like I just finished Harry Potter with</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.619" end="00:57:18.549" style="s2">my daughter right and you know when</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.529" end="00:57:20.259" style="s2">Harry sacrifices himself yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.549" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">the evil is killed and all that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.259" end="00:57:24.939" style="s2">like this is this is an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:29.199" style="s2">well done retelling him the Christ</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.939" end="00:57:30.749" style="s2">archetype very much and mist on certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.199" end="00:57:33.189" style="s2">types of Christians</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.749" end="00:57:34.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a story if I can just interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.189" end="00:57:37.509" style="s2">that&#39;s a I remember a story from CS</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.839" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">Lewis a little girl came to him reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.509" end="00:57:40.910" style="s2">a Narnia Chronicles</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:43.730" style="s2">and this shows you something about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.910" end="00:57:46.550" style="s2">depth of CS Lewis and she said she comes</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.730" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">up and she&#39;s confessional yes I like</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.550" end="00:57:52.310" style="s2">Aslan better than Jesus and he turned to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:55.730" style="s2">her and what insight on Swain he said</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.310" end="00:57:58.010" style="s2">that&#39;s fine that&#39;s okay mm-hmm like he</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.730" end="00:57:59.570" style="s2">got it that if you know that she was</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.010" end="00:58:02.830" style="s2">actually connecting to what really</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.570" end="00:58:05.090" style="s2">really mattered above yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.830" end="00:58:08.150" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m actually reading Chronicles of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.090" end="00:58:09.500" style="s2">Narnia now after Harry Potter was again</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.150" end="00:58:11.210" style="s2">quite interesting because when I read it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.500" end="00:58:12.620" style="s2">as a kid I had no idea that it was meant</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.210" end="00:58:13.790" style="s2">as a direct Christian allegory and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.620" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand the Christian story</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.790" end="00:58:17.090" style="s2">well there&#39;s two things there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:19.580" style="s2">the Christianity but remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.090" end="00:58:21.800" style="s2">what what what is it the professor says</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.580" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s all in Plato I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.800" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">they&#39;re teaching children these days</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">there was a lot of Platonism running</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:33.050" style="s2">through that those that&#39;s doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:35.360" style="s2">powerful yeah so you know in one of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.050" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">two debates with Peterson you said you</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.360" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">know pragmatism is is parasitic on a on</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:43.490" style="s2">a objective sense of truth right yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:45.290" style="s2">those lines but I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.490" end="00:58:54.290" style="s2">there&#39;s something profound about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.290" end="00:58:57.470" style="s2">idea that that that we can&#39;t ever know</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.290" end="00:58:59.000" style="s2">objectively everything you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.470" end="00:59:00.680" style="s2">always we&#39;re always viewing the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.000" end="00:59:02.150" style="s2">for the salience landscape and in some</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.680" end="00:59:05.720" style="s2">sense from a Darwinian perspective all</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.150" end="00:59:08.170" style="s2">we ever have is good enough yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.720" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">that that struck me as profound and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.170" end="00:59:13.730" style="s2">that like in the past you know I would</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:16.630" style="s2">make a parsimony argument for why why</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.730" end="00:59:19.190" style="s2">God didn&#39;t exist which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.630" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s just an ad-hoc</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.190" end="00:59:24.230" style="s2">hypothesis that doesn&#39;t add explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.470" end="00:59:26.750" style="s2">power right right but now I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.230" end="00:59:28.130" style="s2">really weak argument I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.750" end="00:59:31.190" style="s2">commitment abuse of parsimony it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.130" end="00:59:34.300" style="s2">these questions are too big for that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.190" end="00:59:38.630" style="s2">and I don&#39;t personally have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.300" end="00:59:40.180" style="s2">of a divine in the sense that I think a</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.630" end="00:59:42.470" style="s2">lot of people talk about God as having</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.180" end="00:59:45.170" style="s2">but I do have a very strong sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.470" end="00:59:47.000" style="s2">sacred yes I I would that&#39;s clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.170" end="00:59:48.950" style="s2">that&#39;s very clear to me and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.000" end="00:59:51.080" style="s2">sense of the shape the sacred that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.950" end="00:59:52.250" style="s2">some impotent aesthetic you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.080" end="00:59:53.660" style="s2">experience you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.250" end="00:59:56.780" style="s2">sense of the sacred that you share with</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.660" end="00:59:59.710" style="s2">others in in that affords them transfer</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.780" end="01:00:02.630" style="s2">transformative growth it&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.710" end="01:00:06.260" style="s2">evocative and provocative sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.630" end="01:00:07.910" style="s2">have yeah tell me what you think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.260" end="01:00:12.080" style="s2">this if I&#39;m if I&#39;m reading what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.910" end="01:00:14.210" style="s2">saying correctly but for me when when</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.080" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">you talk about non-theism it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.210" end="01:00:18.650" style="s2">like the question of the objective</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:19.340" style="s2">existence of God is just the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.650" end="01:00:22.940" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.340" end="01:00:26.330" style="s2">yes the core of the non-theist position</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.940" end="01:00:28.370" style="s2">is rejecting the shared so it checks the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.330" end="01:00:30.170" style="s2">shared presuppositions on both the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.370" end="01:00:32.810" style="s2">theists and the atheists about how to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.170" end="01:00:35.300" style="s2">best understand this phenomena that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.810" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">and I are clearly exist which is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.300" end="01:00:41.450" style="s2">experience of the sacred that is really</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:43.360" style="s2">transformative of people so right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.450" end="01:00:46.850" style="s2">what I think is the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.360" end="01:00:48.650" style="s2">trying to make trying to frame this in</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.850" end="01:00:53.360" style="s2">terms of the existence or nonexistence</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.650" end="01:00:55.460" style="s2">of a being and that it&#39;s primarily that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.360" end="01:00:59.540" style="s2">and that the way we understand that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.460" end="01:01:02.870" style="s2">by manipulating beliefs and that we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.540" end="01:01:05.720" style="s2">sort of nail down get some final answer</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.870" end="01:01:08.390" style="s2">about the most appropriate symbols for</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.720" end="01:01:10.370" style="s2">that these are all things right and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.390" end="01:01:12.590" style="s2">the fear says yes to all of those and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.370" end="01:01:14.300" style="s2">the atheist agrees that that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.590" end="01:01:17.150" style="s2">framing and then says no to all of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:19.910" style="s2">and the non-theist says no I reject that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.150" end="01:01:24.310" style="s2">framing that framing is I think actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.910" end="01:01:27.800" style="s2">miss framing the phenomena and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.310" end="01:01:29.270" style="s2">meaning that is afforded by that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.800" end="01:01:31.610" style="s2">know the connectedness that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.270" end="01:01:33.770" style="s2">phenomena is is is pointing to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.610" end="01:01:36.830" style="s2">so the non-theist yeah rejects that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.770" end="01:01:40.760" style="s2">question the non-theist says can we come</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.830" end="01:01:42.230" style="s2">up with framing that puts that well I</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.760" end="01:01:45.050" style="s2">want to describe this to you that</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.230" end="01:01:47.660" style="s2">affords us to fall deeply in love with</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.050" end="01:01:49.460" style="s2">being once again mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.660" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">this is very like that&#39;s a Nietzschean</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.460" end="01:01:53.360" style="s2">thing almost right it&#39;s it&#39;s Nietzschean</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.910" style="s2">in some way but I think it&#39;s high</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.360" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">daguerreian because I mean I think the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.910" end="01:02:00.440" style="s2">problem I mean this is a critique that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:03.160" style="s2">he hiding her made of nature that</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.440" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">Nietzsche basically is still locked into</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.160" end="01:02:07.850" style="s2">Nietzsche basically inverts Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:10.520" style="s2">so he&#39;s still locked to it so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.850" end="01:02:12.440" style="s2">the atheist just inverts theism and</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.520" end="01:02:14.570" style="s2">they&#39;re still locked to it and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.440" end="01:02:16.850" style="s2">break out of it it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.570" end="01:02:19.130" style="s2">the white supremacy versus white</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.850" end="01:02:22.280" style="s2">oppression narrative right it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.130" end="01:02:25.310" style="s2">first way that you a narrative that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.280" end="01:02:27.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t serve the first myth first</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.310" end="01:02:29.150" style="s2">response to it is just its inverse yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.380" end="01:02:31.190" style="s2">exactly and you have to try and break</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.150" end="01:02:32.420" style="s2">past them which is what you were trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.190" end="01:02:34.970" style="s2">to talk about with your example of</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.420" end="01:02:38.510" style="s2">parkour that neither the white supremacy</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.970" end="01:02:41.330" style="s2">or the white oppression model explains</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.510" end="01:02:43.670" style="s2">what actually emerged and was created in</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.330" end="01:02:47.900" style="s2">that situation yeah by these kids who</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.670" end="01:02:50.780" style="s2">yeah you know yeah and you know and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.900" end="01:02:55.190" style="s2">had agency they created this yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.780" end="01:02:59.780" style="s2">and and it and it works it works as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.190" end="01:03:02.840" style="s2">tool to to bridge right and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.780" end="01:03:05.150" style="s2">um I think that in some ways like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.840" end="01:03:09.140" style="s2">you can almost view parkour as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.150" end="01:03:11.150" style="s2">analogy or a potential precursor to how</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.140" end="01:03:15.260" style="s2">can we build these tools that function</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.150" end="01:03:18.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like I you know God doesn&#39;t whether</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.260" end="01:03:22.190" style="s2">God exists in a sort of external</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.520" end="01:03:24.350" style="s2">metaphysical objective sense it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.190" end="01:03:26.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.350" end="01:03:28.700" style="s2">representation of God or the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.210" end="01:03:32.120" style="s2">meaningfulness of those things has to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.700" end="01:03:34.340" style="s2">exist for us on some level yes um and if</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.120" end="01:03:35.840" style="s2">we&#39;re not addressing that and if we</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.340" end="01:03:38.800" style="s2">can&#39;t address it in a way that can light</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.840" end="01:03:38.800" style="s2">in the believers and the non-believers</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:45.530" style="s2">then then we&#39;re just stuck with war</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.380" end="01:03:47.240" style="s2">right yes yeah but that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.530" end="01:03:51.020" style="s2">was well that&#39;s why I&#39;m so attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.240" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">your project because you know as much as</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.020" end="01:03:54.500" style="s2">I love and respect what Pierson&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:03:58.070" style="s2">he kind of flirts at the edge of saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.500" end="01:04:01.430" style="s2">it&#39;s neither yeah yeah he rejects the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.070" end="01:04:03.710" style="s2">atheism and he describes Christianity in</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.430" end="01:04:05.480" style="s2">such a way that it&#39;d be very easy to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.710" end="01:04:07.460" style="s2">non-theistic but he doesn&#39;t go to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.480" end="01:04:08.480" style="s2">point of saying I&#39;m actually approaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.460" end="01:04:11.210" style="s2">this as a non theist</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.480" end="01:04:13.790" style="s2">yeah and I as you know I&#39;ve criticized</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.210" end="01:04:15.260" style="s2">him for yeah I&#39;m not doing that because</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.790" end="01:04:19.630" style="s2">I think you could make a very clear case</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.260" end="01:04:24.530" style="s2">that young is a non-theist for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.630" end="01:04:26.060" style="s2">so yeah so that onion I&#39;ve been in I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.530" end="01:04:28.550" style="s2">been trying to articulate this with this</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.970" end="01:04:42.640" style="s2">then there&#39;s the relationship yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.770" end="01:04:44.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s so much of where we get stuck</p>

<p begin="01:04:44.380" end="01:04:48.950" style="s2">is reframed once you recognize that the</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.950" end="01:04:54.650" style="s2">relationship yeah well that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.040" end="01:04:55.640" style="s2">and you know and I think I I bang you</p>

<p begin="01:05:38.660" end="01:05:43.130" style="s2">can you talked about tool and whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.190" end="01:05:48.190" style="s2">something and this is a you know wisdom</p>

<p begin="01:05:52.610" end="01:05:55.610" style="s2">there&#39;s aspiration there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:04.670" end="01:06:09.880" style="s2">explicitly now more focally where what</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.400" end="01:06:12.620" style="s2">how does wisdom fit into this for you I</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.880" end="01:06:16.090" style="s2">suppose the first response to after that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.620" end="01:06:19.580" style="s2">is I&#39;m a I&#39;m 38 and I jump between trees</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.090" end="01:06:23.570" style="s2">like wisdom is such an interesting word</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.580" end="01:06:25.370" style="s2">I like I&#39;ve been insightful for most of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.570" end="01:06:28.340" style="s2">my life I guess</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.370" end="01:06:30.080" style="s2">mom tells stories about like going on</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.340" end="01:06:31.970" style="s2">walks with me and like finding me</p>

<p begin="01:06:35.570" end="01:06:42.200" style="s2">and so at 16 I actually the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.340" end="01:06:43.880" style="s2">religion that I got involved in the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.200" end="01:06:48.560" style="s2">religion I really been involved in was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.880" end="01:06:50.990" style="s2">was a Native American sort of recovery I</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.560" end="01:06:53.990" style="s2">don&#39;t understand right there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.990" end="01:06:56.510" style="s2">of of white people following this Native</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.990" end="01:06:59.690" style="s2">American leader Johnny Moses doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.510" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">something called suus so it&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.690" end="01:07:03.050" style="s2">community and and I was talking about my</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:04.460" style="s2">ideas whatever those ideas were at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.050" end="01:07:07.190" style="s2">time and a lot of people would tell me</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.460" end="01:07:08.690" style="s2">that I was wise right and and it just</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.190" end="01:07:11.600" style="s2">stuck in my craw</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.690" end="01:07:15.470" style="s2">because how could it 16 you&#39;ll be wise I</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.600" end="01:07:18.620" style="s2">had no experience for me wisdom was was</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.470" end="01:07:23.060" style="s2">experienced married to insight yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.620" end="01:07:26.990" style="s2">at a time you know I I love the way that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.060" end="01:07:30.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve articulated wisdom I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.990" end="01:07:33.020" style="s2">that I mean I don&#39;t know that that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.140" end="01:07:34.280" style="s2">art that I&#39;ve have I integrated into the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.020" end="01:07:37.040" style="s2">way that I&#39;m thinking about I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.280" end="01:07:39.890" style="s2">want I want to afford people insight</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.040" end="01:07:43.790" style="s2">generation yeah is very deeply connect</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.890" end="01:07:46.730" style="s2">to that and I think I mean there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.790" end="01:07:48.710" style="s2">site one of the things that I ask is do</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.730" end="01:07:51.560" style="s2">people do the right it&#39;s a neat chink</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.710" end="01:07:55.870" style="s2">question right Oh most of morality is</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.560" end="01:07:59.420" style="s2">just cowardice yeah I I feel like we</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.870" end="01:08:01.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve lived through the easiest times in</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.420" end="01:08:06.830" style="s2">human history and maybe that&#39;s ending</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.760" end="01:08:11.120" style="s2">yeah but but people most people behave</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.830" end="01:08:13.100" style="s2">well in these nice times not because</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.120" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">they have a well cultivated virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.100" end="01:08:18.140" style="s2">wisdom and and ethics but because the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:20.390" style="s2">game is set up so that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.140" end="01:08:23.630" style="s2">rewarded to some degree yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.390" end="01:08:25.360" style="s2">and I think that if you can set the game</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.630" end="01:08:28.850" style="s2">up to reward good behavior that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.360" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">but you want to build also the people</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.850" end="01:08:33.650" style="s2">such that even when the game shifts when</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:34.639" style="s2">things change that&#39;s still what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.650" end="01:08:38.599" style="s2">rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.639" end="01:08:41.569" style="s2">and I have this or at least we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.599" end="01:08:43.609" style="s2">recording I don&#39;t see wisdom right I</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.569" end="01:08:46.099" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t see our political class as</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.609" end="01:08:49.639" style="s2">wise I don&#39;t see our academic class as</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.099" end="01:08:51.109" style="s2">wise and I also see I mean I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.639" end="01:08:54.949" style="s2">a passion here but I see cowardice</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.109" end="01:08:58.069" style="s2">everywhere I see people who who who have</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.949" end="01:08:59.659" style="s2">who are not willing to look deeply at</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.069" end="01:09:01.699" style="s2">themselves who are not willing to try</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.659" end="01:09:05.239" style="s2">hard things who are not willing to take</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.699" end="01:09:06.979" style="s2">on difficult questions who who who are</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.239" end="01:09:10.130" style="s2">not guys that I want beside me in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.979" end="01:09:12.799" style="s2">shield wall all right and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.130" end="01:09:14.389" style="s2">because because they haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.799" end="01:09:17.329" style="s2">chance to test themselves and to grow</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.389" end="01:09:20.059" style="s2">themselves and because our because there</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.329" end="01:09:21.439" style="s2">has to be something you know more there</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.059" end="01:09:23.659" style="s2">has to be something we&#39;re aspiring to</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.439" end="01:09:25.219" style="s2">and there has to be systems that give us</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.659" end="01:09:27.619" style="s2">that opportunity for serious play but</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.219" end="01:09:31.519" style="s2">also a necessity for discipline</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.619" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">right and that that&#39;s that&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.519" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in is that that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:38.569" style="s2">that cultivation of virtue through</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:40.939" style="s2">practice and and one of those is is is</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.569" end="01:09:46.719" style="s2">wisdom but I would say that in in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.939" end="01:09:51.049" style="s2">ecology of of the cultivation of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.719" end="01:09:55.579" style="s2">my role and what my work has been about</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.049" end="01:09:58.849" style="s2">is more about courage and your role is</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.579" end="01:10:03.289" style="s2">more about wisdom that&#39;s fair that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.849" end="01:10:05.149" style="s2">fair but I I want and I&#39;m very attracted</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.289" end="01:10:07.820" style="s2">to the idea of the synthesis but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.149" end="01:10:10.459" style="s2">that if I&#39;m a at least at this stage of</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.820" end="01:10:12.530" style="s2">my life right if I&#39;m going to do to lead</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.459" end="01:10:15.010" style="s2">people on a path I feel like the path</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.530" end="01:10:20.840" style="s2">around courage is the path that I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.010" end="01:10:25.419" style="s2">most most informed with right most</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.840" end="01:10:27.679" style="s2">resonant with yeah I I feel I have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.419" end="01:10:29.300" style="s2">subject-matter expertise that I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.679" end="01:10:32.030" style="s2">fairly put myself in front of people</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.300" end="01:10:33.979" style="s2">there and if people get wisdom from what</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.030" end="01:10:37.099" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and perhaps they do then</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.979" end="01:10:39.559" style="s2">that&#39;s great but to take on wisdom as at</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.099" end="01:10:40.459" style="s2">the center of it feels presumptuous yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.559" end="01:10:42.139" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.459" end="01:10:44.499" style="s2">well I mean we&#39;re all swell we are</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.139" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">always and only supposed to be lovely</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.499" end="01:10:49.490" style="s2">yes I think that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:54.050" style="s2">love the idea of philosophy oh you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.490" end="01:10:55.850" style="s2">we were talking about who is the avatar</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.050" end="01:10:58.250" style="s2">of the person who comes to the work that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.850" end="01:11:00.530" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and it&#39;s like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.250" end="01:11:03.740" style="s2">philosophical movement person right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.530" end="01:11:07.010" style="s2">yeah yeah well you and Mark are those</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.740" end="01:11:10.100" style="s2">kind of people yeah I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.010" end="01:11:12.280" style="s2">clear to me that&#39;s why no I enjoy so</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.100" end="01:11:16.270" style="s2">much spending time with both of you yeah</p>

<p begin="01:11:17.510" end="01:11:23.480" style="s2">Rafe this was really wonderful I really</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.750" end="01:11:26.270" style="s2">want to thank you very much for for</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.480" end="01:11:28.790" style="s2">coming of course please</p>

<p begin="01:11:28.790" end="01:11:33.860" style="s2">think Rafe does really important work</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.880" end="01:11:36.710" style="s2">and I always recommending what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.860" end="01:11:40.100" style="s2">doing I I hope this video shows you the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.710" end="01:11:41.930" style="s2">depth and the seriousness of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.100" end="01:11:45.050" style="s2">doing and why it&#39;s so pertinent and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.930" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">relevant to the meaning crisis and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.050" end="01:11:49.370" style="s2">the way in which right now the dama side</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:51.620" style="s2">aspect is what the meaning crisis is</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.370" end="01:11:53.960" style="s2">really being exacerbated in ways that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.620" end="01:11:55.940" style="s2">think are gonna have some pretty serious</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.960" end="01:11:57.590" style="s2">mental health impacts and there are</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.940" end="01:11:59.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a way there&#39;s an alternative way</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.590" end="01:12:05.240" style="s2">to go forward we do not have to just</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.420" end="01:12:07.820" style="s2">sort of suffer homicide and the mental</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.240" end="01:12:09.680" style="s2">health deterioration that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.820" end="01:12:13.160" style="s2">this exacerbation the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.680" end="01:12:15.650" style="s2">there&#39;s alternatives we can make use of</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.160" end="01:12:17.990" style="s2">and they work and Rafe is here to show</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.650" end="01:12:20.780" style="s2">you and to tell you to exemplify the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.990" end="01:12:22.670" style="s2">fact that they do work and so I want to</p>

<p begin="01:12:35.570" end="01:12:38.930" style="s2">maybe even have it a second one where we</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">go deeper into the idea of the Dhamma</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.930" end="01:12:43.820" style="s2">side because I think that uh yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:45.710" style="s2">think that I think that people still</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.820" end="01:12:48.500" style="s2">have not grappled with just how</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.710" end="01:12:50.660" style="s2">disruptive this might be yeah um world</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.500" end="01:12:51.530" style="s2">that we know I think people are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.660" end="01:12:53.000" style="s2">thinking that they&#39;re going to come out</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.530" end="01:12:56.120" style="s2">of their bunker and it&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.000" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">same world know after the Great</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.120" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">Depression and World War two these are</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:13:00.770" style="s2">the we have to remember that this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:03.980" style="s2">this is the first</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.770" end="01:13:06.110" style="s2">world encompassing world challenging</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.980" end="01:13:07.970" style="s2">event we&#39;ve come the analogs are the</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.110" end="01:13:11.720" style="s2">Great Depression and World War two and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.970" end="01:13:14.420" style="s2">went Wars pandemics it&#39;s we haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.720" end="01:13:17.330" style="s2">this in 80 years that&#39;s right and when</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.420" end="01:13:19.700" style="s2">so and after the Great Depression in</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.330" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">World War two we did not go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.700" end="01:13:23.540" style="s2">way things were before those events we</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:26.390" style="s2">did not go back and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.540" end="01:13:29.450" style="s2">going back either mines team calls this</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.390" end="01:13:31.730" style="s2">the awakening from the great nap baby</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.450" end="01:13:35.240" style="s2">and especially and I think you agree</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.730" end="01:13:37.100" style="s2">with me too that I I strongly suspect</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.240" end="01:13:40.190" style="s2">that this is not the only pandemic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.100" end="01:13:42.190" style="s2">going to be facing so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.190" end="01:13:45.830" style="s2">worry about that that if we don&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.190" end="01:13:47.450" style="s2">factory farming will act markets and a</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.830" end="01:13:49.970" style="s2">lot of other things so you know also</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.450" end="01:13:53.510" style="s2">melting the permafrost and slashing your</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.970" end="01:13:55.220" style="s2">lane for us and ocean currents and air</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.510" end="01:13:57.320" style="s2">currents like we&#39;re doing a lot we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.220" end="01:14:01.000" style="s2">messing around with a very very complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.320" end="01:14:05.810" style="s2">system in a really positive way</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.000" end="01:14:08.360" style="s2">absolutely so I think that um if if the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.810" end="01:14:10.280" style="s2">thesis is correct that the that you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.360" end="01:14:12.950" style="s2">essentially let&#39;s say we we had an</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.280" end="01:14:15.470" style="s2">identity we had a we had a home to some</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.950" end="01:14:18.020" style="s2">degree yeah has been deeply disturbed</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.470" end="01:14:20.360" style="s2">and we need bridges to the next home and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.020" end="01:14:22.400" style="s2">to to be able to still start building it</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.360" end="01:14:24.350" style="s2">and that means that we can&#39;t be those</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.400" end="01:14:27.080" style="s2">comfortable people in our shells anymore</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.350" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">we have to have cultivate virtue and we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.080" end="01:14:30.950" style="s2">need those bridges to the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:32.740" style="s2">virtue and the capacity to create the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.950" end="01:14:35.180" style="s2">next home</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.740" end="01:14:37.970" style="s2">well I&#39;ll build on the metaphor slightly</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.180" end="01:14:41.180" style="s2">I think we had a home but it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.970" end="01:14:43.460" style="s2">actually seriously deteriorated process</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.180" end="01:14:45.110" style="s2">so that it&#39;s like when the wind is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.460" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">disturbed it has a very great chance</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.110" end="01:14:50.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to in some significant</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:53.240" style="s2">way collapse and I think yeah building</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.720" end="01:14:57.500" style="s2">bridges is exactly what we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.240" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">doing right now so so yeah so I offer my</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.500" end="01:15:01.580" style="s2">work as a potential bridge for people if</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s interesting if it feels</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.580" end="01:15:06.140" style="s2">like it might help them sustain and</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:08.860" style="s2">cultivate something that will take them</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.140" end="01:15:11.619" style="s2">into this potentially a very new world</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.860" end="01:15:15.280" style="s2">yeah well we&#39;ll definitely talk again</p>
