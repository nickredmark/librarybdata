<p begin="00:00:03.179" end="00:00:09.570" style="s2">Anderson his last name is Todd some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:12.210" style="s2">you have noted that the discussion I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">with him was causing quite a stir we</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.210" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">were talking about young shadow work the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">work of Jordan Peterson and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">relationship between young and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:26.970" style="s2">Christianity and I&#39;m pleased that</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">Anderson has agreed to join us again and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.970" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">to answer questions I want to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">something I&#39;m going to give priority to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">the questions that are specifically</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">towards Anderson some of your sending</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:42.980" style="s2">questions to me they please resubmit</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">those to the general Q&amp;A I do for</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">patrons I want to focus today on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">questions that are specifically directed</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:54.539" style="s2">towards Anderson and a response to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">previous discussion at some point</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">Anderson it might be good if you went</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">over your discussion of the golden</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.230" style="s2">shadow again</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">but I&#39;d like to begin by a question</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.230" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">right I get the first question it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">channel which is some of people have</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:13.979" style="s2">commented about the argument that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">weaving through our discussion but you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.979" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">were largely in agreement with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">Young is better understood as a non</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">theist and that his relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">Christianity was much more ambivalent</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">and critical than an apologetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2">relationship and that was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">some of the criticisms of some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">Jordans take on young and so some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">replied by that by saying that because</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this no doubt you have to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">famous interview with young towards the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">end of his life I believe where he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">asked if he believed in God and he said</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe I know and many people</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">take that as well they they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">taking it as an indication that Young</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">was stating very clearly that he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">some kind of theist how would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:01:59.550" style="s2">respond to two to that well I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">first thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.550" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">say that as I mentioned in our talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">young is perhaps best approached with an</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:11.040" style="s2">eye to completeness over consistency in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">his work that&#39;s changing the emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.040" end="00:02:15.180" style="s2">changes so particularly after he had his</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">heart attack I think he comes in much</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.180" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">more strongly sort of firing the guns a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">mystical sense and also you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">indicated that he had sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:28.310" style="s2">direct rather than inferential or</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:31.020" style="s2">logically arrived in some way in college</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.310" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">however when I think about this I often</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.020" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">think about because it is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:39.300" style="s2">common question I think about Young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">relationship to AAA and the 12 steps so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.300" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">a lot of people don&#39;t don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:44.970" style="s2">you know I actually had some impact on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">am twelve steps I didn&#39;t know that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.970" end="00:02:50.460" style="s2">so I think yeah the guy who&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">founder was in correspondence with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.460" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">know I&#39;m during the period and there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">a sort of a famous set of letters of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:03:00.420" style="s2">exchange where basically says that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">wants to conquer his addiction he needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">to to make a sort of a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:06.270" style="s2">appeal to a higher power now the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:07.830" style="s2">interesting thing is right when that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.270" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">sort of filters through a a eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.830" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">that becomes a relatively theist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">sort of you know the Christian century</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:18.300" style="s2">sort of within they con things but of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:19.860" style="s2">course if you read young the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.300" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">an appeals of a higher power when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.860" end="00:03:23.520" style="s2">considering the relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">capital s self it&#39;s considerably more</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.520" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">complicated the thing even if it has all</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">of the symbolic machinery in appearances</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">of that stuff so when he says that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">you know he doesn&#39;t believe he knows is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">what does he know what does he mean when</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about God and then I sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">of how I would approach it and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">whatever extent you want to draw a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">distinction between you know theism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.260" style="s2">non-theism that sense it&#39;s like well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:51.490" style="s2">appearances might be the same but how</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:53.350" style="s2">you&#39;re interpreting the underlying event</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.490" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">different correct right and I would tend</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.350" end="00:03:57.730" style="s2">to say that based on sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:03:59.830" style="s2">overarching body of his work it&#39;s fairer</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.730" end="00:04:02.290" style="s2">to interpret you know in fact of saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.830" end="00:04:04.450" style="s2">like we can&#39;t really know the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.290" end="00:04:05.860" style="s2">we can know that there is an event we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.450" end="00:04:07.270" style="s2">can know that it&#39;s powerfully meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.860" end="00:04:08.410" style="s2">we can have an encounter with that thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.270" end="00:04:10.060" style="s2">I know it in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.410" end="00:04:13.390" style="s2">mm-hmm but that&#39;s not quite the same as</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.060" end="00:04:17.890" style="s2">as sort of the theistic faith commitment</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.390" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">right so that would line up with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.890" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">fact that young often points to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:28.150" style="s2">impersonal representations of the self</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">like the Sun or mandala figures as also</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.150" end="00:04:33.580" style="s2">things that point towards how he knows</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">God isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t that correct that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.580" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">right and so you know you have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">a double relationship there as you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:42.700" style="s2">with many archetypes so they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:45.070" style="s2">the personalized intercessor an emissary</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.700" end="00:04:46.840" style="s2">versions of the self and like we talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.070" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">a bit about Richard yep yeah yeah last</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">time and that&#39;s sort of very close to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:54.700" style="s2">the self in a way as far as archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">go but then there&#39;s also these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.700" end="00:04:58.930" style="s2">yeah impersonal principles of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:05:01.300" style="s2">organization right that you see and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.930" end="00:05:03.640" style="s2">there are sort of archetypes of pattern</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.300" end="00:05:05.890" style="s2">right so the mandala is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.640" end="00:05:10.480" style="s2">best-known example of this but you get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.890" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">bunch of other examples yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.480" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">the Sun as being a thing is you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">treat it as a personal sort of figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">but the whole point is that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:20.950" style="s2">it&#39;s more transcendent than that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:22.450" style="s2">think about the use of the Sun in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.950" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">in the Republic at the road with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.450" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">road how it&#39;s a representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:28.330" style="s2">good yeah yeah I often consider this</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.500" end="00:05:29.920" style="s2">stuff and this is not directly derived</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.330" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">from from you know but I don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.920" end="00:05:34.030" style="s2">it it&#39;s sort of in Kabbalistic terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:35.470" style="s2">right and as you climb the tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.030" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with sort of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.470" end="00:05:39.250" style="s2">increasing and rarified</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.590" style="s2">versions of the divine in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.250" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.590" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">you know the the solders here which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">sort of in the middle of the Tree of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.340" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">Life is a kind of you know solar</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">resurrecting God representation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">definitely divine right but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:05:56.790" style="s2">the sort of birth rebirth kinds of gods</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">but when you get up to the top when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.790" end="00:06:01.530" style="s2">get up to things like a catheter that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.830" end="00:06:04.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have energy or form they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.530" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">just kind of like raw Godhead yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.170" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">and so there are I think some</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:11.760" style="s2">representations on solving sure that</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.760" end="00:06:15.900" style="s2">aspect impersonal aspect but but again</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.570" style="s2">the stuff is you know plate you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.900" end="00:06:19.950" style="s2">right that&#39;s very interesting I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.570" end="00:06:23.850" style="s2">to we have time I&#39;d like to talk you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.950" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">more about the sort of polarity between</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.850" end="00:06:30.510" style="s2">the personal relationship to God which</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:32.700" style="s2">might be sort of more interest</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.510" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">psychically directed and the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.700" end="00:06:36.930" style="s2">one which might be sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:38.700" style="s2">ontologically directed and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:40.340" style="s2">when they get in to serve an anti-god</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.700" end="00:06:44.070" style="s2">residence because it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.340" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">people generally are trying to point</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.070" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">both directions at the same time when</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:06:53.070" style="s2">they&#39;re invoking this notion of God so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:54.420" style="s2">we have another question I&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.070" end="00:06:56.490" style="s2">you or switching to questions from</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.420" end="00:07:00.510" style="s2">patreon so once again thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.490" end="00:07:05.370" style="s2">much patrons for all your support</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.510" end="00:07:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s much appreciated and so the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.370" end="00:07:10.920" style="s2">one is from Lisa Connie I believe and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.450" end="00:07:12.510" style="s2">hope you&#39;ll be these questions out -</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.920" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">unison thanks my question for Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.510" end="00:07:17.160" style="s2">Todd how would you evaluate Carl Jung as</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:20.250" style="s2">a philosopher was he one if so to what</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.160" end="00:07:23.670" style="s2">degree if mr. Todd would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.250" end="00:07:26.700" style="s2">explain that Carl Jung&#39;s philosophy I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.670" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">just want to mention one thing before we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.700" end="00:07:34.620" style="s2">begin not only is Anderson a practicing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:37.669" style="s2">psychotherapist somebody who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">through this continuing to be within</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.669" end="00:07:43.320" style="s2">he&#39;s also the person who teaches the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">young courses at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.320" end="00:07:46.380" style="s2">Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:47.639" style="s2">so Anderson often has to deal with these</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.380" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">kinds of questions in this course is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.639" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">about the relationship between young as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">a psychologist and young as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:55.380" style="s2">philosopher so what would you say about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.950" style="s2">you know what kind of what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.380" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">philosopher is is Carl young and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.950" end="00:08:03.450" style="s2">the elevator pitch version of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:05.820" style="s2">philosophy right okay so it depends in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:07.560" style="s2">part what we mean by philosopher I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.820" end="00:08:09.570" style="s2">you only have sort of an analytical</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.560" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">tradition philosopher is I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.570" end="00:08:14.040" style="s2">quite weak yes right as a continental</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.780" style="s2">philosopher on the other hand he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.040" end="00:08:18.210" style="s2">of well nested within a tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:19.979" style="s2">other people in that vein a very most</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.210" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">content in that way - yeah very much</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.979" end="00:08:23.430" style="s2">right and so you know when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">the influences which we discussed before</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.430" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">right we you know you look at Hegel when</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.110" end="00:08:29.700" style="s2">you look at content you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:32.130" style="s2">Nietzsche and you look at you know hated</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.700" end="00:08:34.169" style="s2">Schopenhauer v yes so which is weird</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">actually anyway but you know you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.169" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">those people and he is firmly situated</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">in that tradition and I would say in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:44.070" style="s2">that sense how is he as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:45.930" style="s2">relatively derivative but insofar if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.070" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">mean by philosophers we mean Philo</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.930" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">Sophia if we mean a lover of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">there&#39;s no question that Jung is firmly</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">situated in that camp and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">the thing that Jung brings somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:57.990" style="s2">uniquely I don&#39;t know if this qualifies</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:08:59.820" style="s2">as an elevator pitch but when he</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.990" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">interfaces and knits together a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.820" end="00:09:05.940" style="s2">this material he does so with an eye</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:08.339" style="s2">towards the phenomenology of lived</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.940" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">experience would I say everything and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.339" end="00:09:14.250" style="s2">you know depth psychology in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:16.950" style="s2">is one of the last sort of big umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.250" end="00:09:18.750" style="s2">psychologies right psychology in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.950" end="00:09:20.760" style="s2">academic psychology experimental</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.750" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">psychology now tends to be very focused</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.760" end="00:09:25.740" style="s2">on relatively narrow kind Josh Jones</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s right depth psychology is in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.740" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">ways less a psychology per se than it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.920" end="00:09:34.650" style="s2">a sort of overarching worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">method like it sort of encompasses you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.650" end="00:09:38.940" style="s2">know virtually anything I can talk on</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.150" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">almost any topic right so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.940" end="00:09:42.779" style="s2">as a lover of wisdom I think Jung is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:44.610" style="s2">deeply committed to philosophy and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.779" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">asking the questions that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.610" end="00:09:49.230" style="s2">are fundamental to philosophy who are we</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">who are we as people and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.230" end="00:09:54.900" style="s2">are we what kind of beings are we right</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:57.510" style="s2">and his answer to that is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.900" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">not unit of beings right that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.510" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">the psychodynamic basis is the rejection</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:03.540" style="s2">of this unit of bias so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:05.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not unit of beings that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.540" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">important part he&#39;s he has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.670" end="00:10:09.450" style="s2">emphasis on this transactive quality</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:11.640" style="s2">although I don&#39;t think you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">Corbin in fact sort of articulates a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:17.130" style="s2">of that much better yeah but his lived</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">sense of it as being sort of a clinician</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.130" end="00:10:21.840" style="s2">and working with people in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:23.940" style="s2">how those inner transformations and math</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.840" end="00:10:26.460" style="s2">and ultimately speaking the efforts that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.940" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">he made to try to you know to try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.460" end="00:10:30.780" style="s2">seal the mind-body rift like we talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">about that and I think he just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.780" end="00:10:34.830" style="s2">have the machinery available but given</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">what he did have available he actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.830" end="00:10:39.900" style="s2">makes some sort of remarkable inroads</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:42.180" style="s2">right for the time which is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.900" end="00:10:43.710" style="s2">a lot of you know there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.180" end="00:10:44.790" style="s2">other thinkers in the period that took</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.710" end="00:10:47.880" style="s2">him quite seriously</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:50.430" style="s2">even when he was persona non grata so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.880" end="00:10:55.620" style="s2">you know how do I think he rates as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.430" end="00:10:58.020" style="s2">philosopher he does not always have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.620" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">meticulousness of mind I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.020" end="00:11:02.250" style="s2">characterizes the best philosophers but</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:04.950" style="s2">he has a scope and a breadth and a depth</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">that compensates for that provided that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.950" end="00:11:07.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not reading him in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a good answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.830" end="00:11:19.790" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s very helpful so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">next question is patreon from Connor</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.790" end="00:11:24.450" style="s2">aside from Green journaling and in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.130" style="s2">experience what practices would you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.450" end="00:11:28.500" style="s2">recommend for getting in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.130" end="00:11:30.390" style="s2">the archetypes after having done shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:33.090" style="s2">work the archetypes after everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.390" end="00:11:36.060" style="s2">that&#39;s what questions asking us so when</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.090" end="00:11:39.780" style="s2">I teach this material very often I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.060" end="00:11:42.630" style="s2">what doing dream work is useful in part</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.780" end="00:11:44.910" style="s2">because it is a very ready at hand</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.630" end="00:11:46.110" style="s2">altered state so the argument that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.910" end="00:11:48.990" style="s2">typically make when I teach this</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.110" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">material and I teach a course on this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.990" end="00:11:55.140" style="s2">that in fact our best bet is altered</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.400" style="s2">states promptly construed hmm so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:11:57.750" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been including that is you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.400" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">know I maker or rough you know there</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.750" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t very good taxonomy around altered</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:02.750" style="s2">states we don&#39;t have good and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:05.030" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.750" end="00:12:07.180" style="s2">but roughly speaking I sort of dropped</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.030" end="00:12:10.460" style="s2">them into three camps I think of of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.180" end="00:12:12.380" style="s2">endogenous altered states I think of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.460" end="00:12:14.660" style="s2">sort of psycho technological or</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.380" end="00:12:16.280" style="s2">technique based altering states and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.660" end="00:12:18.410" style="s2">I think of exogenous altered states</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.280" end="00:12:20.630" style="s2">right so the endogenous are all of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.410" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">states that you know deviate from some</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.630" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">kind of statistical baseline and give us</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">an extreme experience so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">experiencing extreme emotions bends our</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:31.550" style="s2">salience landscape and our experience in</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">ways that the ancients for instance</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.550" end="00:12:34.010" style="s2">could easily recognize this like love is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.140" style="s2">madness</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.010" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">yeah right and so all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.140" end="00:12:40.820" style="s2">are in some sense madness right that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:44.300" style="s2">form of madness for whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.820" end="00:12:46.970" style="s2">worth our states which give us sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.300" end="00:12:48.440" style="s2">an access and a perspective to parts of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.970" end="00:12:50.210" style="s2">the unconscious and parts of our own</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.440" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">nature that we don&#39;t normally have and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.210" end="00:12:54.500" style="s2">so being able to move into those states</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:56.450" style="s2">and move back out of them right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.500" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">reintegrate that material is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.450" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">first move that I would generally</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:01.520" style="s2">recommend so that can include strong</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:03.470" style="s2">emotions it can include other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.520" end="00:13:06.830" style="s2">endogenous states that are easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.470" end="00:13:09.230" style="s2">through spinning right yeah so spinning</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.830" end="00:13:10.910" style="s2">I joke is sort of the first altered</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.230" end="00:13:12.500" style="s2">state kids figure out how to reliably</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.910" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">reproduce right and they&#39;ll span and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.500" end="00:13:16.790" style="s2">spin and spin and spin and spin in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">grass but you know it also plays a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.790" end="00:13:20.180" style="s2">somewhat central role in various</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.089" style="s2">religious traditions right the end of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.180" end="00:13:24.380" style="s2">whirling dervishes this movie tradition</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.089" end="00:13:26.180" style="s2">and I have some sort of cog site</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.380" end="00:13:28.070" style="s2">theories about how that might involve</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.180" end="00:13:30.530" style="s2">the hyper activation of the cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.070" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">provides insight and if whatever but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.530" end="00:13:34.250" style="s2">point is right you&#39;re trying all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.839" end="00:13:35.960" style="s2">things where you&#39;re moving your</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.250" end="00:13:38.120" style="s2">experience you&#39;re moving your sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.960" end="00:13:40.430" style="s2">phenomenological landscape into novel</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.120" end="00:13:41.810" style="s2">configurations and different experiences</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.430" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna reveal things about you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.810" end="00:13:46.730" style="s2">would would taste like the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.350" style="s2">also be included in that category yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.730" end="00:13:51.740" style="s2">would say so I mean the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.350" end="00:13:53.930" style="s2">hopefully is a relatively common one but</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.740" end="00:13:56.030" style="s2">it is a relatively also extreme state</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.930" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">right so peak experiences for sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.030" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">insofar as we think of Maslow&#39;s peak</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:03.110" style="s2">experiences is linked up with flow</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">States absolutely states of awe right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:07.130" style="s2">all the stuff around positive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:09.290" style="s2">state of powerful states of awe but also</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.130" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">other kinds of things I mean basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.290" end="00:14:13.180" style="s2">making a picture for experience if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:14.830" style="s2">want to get to know your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.180" end="00:14:16.660" style="s2">you combined together experience with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.830" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">certain kind of analytical mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.660" end="00:14:21.010" style="s2">you want your experience to be in many</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:23.530" style="s2">ways as sort of varied as possible you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.010" end="00:14:24.400" style="s2">want to chart out far points because</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.530" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get more information</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.400" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">about yourself right the nature of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:30.760" style="s2">mind and then you have to treat it with</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.470" style="s2">the kind of analytical eye so is it kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.760" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">of like a deep learning cycle you run</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.470" end="00:14:35.860" style="s2">all this experiential variation and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.080" style="s2">you do a sort of an analytic compression</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.860" end="00:14:39.580" style="s2">to try and pick up and then you re very</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.080" end="00:14:40.660" style="s2">and you&#39;re sort of cycling through it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.580" end="00:14:42.310" style="s2">that way so you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.660" end="00:14:43.450" style="s2">invariance I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.310" end="00:14:45.880" style="s2">something that you&#39;re definitely looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.450" end="00:14:47.290" style="s2">for but there&#39;s also an analytical</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.880" end="00:14:50.280" style="s2">component which is you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.290" end="00:14:53.050" style="s2">drilling in with sort of successive</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.280" end="00:14:55.180" style="s2">Socratic but what are we actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.050" end="00:14:57.520" style="s2">talking about obviously right so so as</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.180" end="00:15:00.100" style="s2">an example a thing that I find a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.520" end="00:15:02.980" style="s2">clinical work that was something of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.100" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">discovery for me was you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.980" end="00:15:07.090" style="s2">people have a hard time accessing their</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">preferences right so people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.090" end="00:15:10.630" style="s2">what they want and that was a shock to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:12.280" style="s2">me because I have very ready access to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.630" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">my preferences but this lines up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.280" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">some good cognitive psychology people</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">are very bad at affective forecasting</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:22.660" style="s2">right actually very bad at forecasting</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:24.520" style="s2">how they&#39;ll be happy or sad when I win</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.660" end="00:15:25.540" style="s2">some and your end forecasting generally</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.520" end="00:15:27.100" style="s2">right yeah end to end of history</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.540" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">illusion yeah yeah and all that business</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:31.660" style="s2">so yeah I think people and and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">typically to me demonstrates it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.660" end="00:15:36.340" style="s2">right we don&#39;t really know what the arc</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:38.050" style="s2">and velocity of our being our frame we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.340" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">don&#39;t really know where we&#39;re going um</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.050" end="00:15:46.870" style="s2">so but but nevertheless nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.860" end="00:15:48.670" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing this sort of back and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.870" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">forth right we&#39;re we&#39;re expanding into</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.670" end="00:15:52.330" style="s2">the space won&#39;t bring it back the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:53.890" style="s2">analytical question comes up so when</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.330" end="00:15:55.930" style="s2">people don&#39;t know the preferences that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.890" end="00:15:57.400" style="s2">hard enough but even if people do know</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.930" end="00:15:59.380" style="s2">their preferences the question is then</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.400" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">why do you have those preferences and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.380" end="00:16:02.710" style="s2">the more extreme or unusual the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:04.780" style="s2">preferences are people don&#39;t question</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.710" end="00:16:08.050" style="s2">them so it&#39;s like you really like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.780" end="00:16:10.330" style="s2">piece of music why why do you like it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.050" end="00:16:12.190" style="s2">and there might be a lot of reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.330" end="00:16:13.990" style="s2">you might have particular attachments to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.190" end="00:16:16.090" style="s2">it you might have whatever or you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.990" end="00:16:18.910" style="s2">you have a particular taste so for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.090" end="00:16:22.779" style="s2">instance people&#39;s tastes</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.910" end="00:16:23.649" style="s2">in sort of fiction or sex are often very</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.779" end="00:16:25.870" style="s2">revealing right</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.649" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">okay so people&#39;s attractions so people</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.870" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">you know if you start to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.529" style="s2">why why do I like this right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.100" end="00:16:34.509" style="s2">drilling in and also you&#39;re altering</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.529" end="00:16:36.129" style="s2">your state you know frequently enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.509" end="00:16:37.959" style="s2">that you&#39;re having novel experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.129" end="00:16:39.790" style="s2">then sort of tracking your own</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.959" end="00:16:41.230" style="s2">experiences in this analytical way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.790" end="00:16:43.899" style="s2">think you begin to be able to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.230" end="00:16:45.790" style="s2">infer both a bit of structure but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.899" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">some of your unconscious contents that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.790" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">are normally harder to get at so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:53.649" style="s2">that was the endogenous what about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">second technological and the exogenous</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.649" end="00:16:58.149" style="s2">right so really I think those things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:00.759" style="s2">are continual my minutes come with</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.149" end="00:17:03.430" style="s2">arbitrary distinction the endogenous are</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.759" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">just easy to get at and typically safe</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.430" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">right like if you&#39;re doing breath work</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:10.089" style="s2">for instance to move in on an altered</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:11.650" style="s2">state yeah you know you might over</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.089" end="00:17:13.510" style="s2">saturate yourself with oxygen or</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.650" end="00:17:16.329" style="s2">something but you know you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.510" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">you know have too serious a problem the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.329" end="00:17:21.220" style="s2">psycho technological I think of as being</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:24.309" style="s2">techniques and sometimes technologies</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.220" end="00:17:26.740" style="s2">but mostly techniques which leverage the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.309" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">existing systems in different ways or</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.740" end="00:17:32.950" style="s2">exact those systems or build those</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:36.549" style="s2">systems this seems like camping</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.950" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">meditation you know extreme exercise or</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.549" end="00:17:42.490" style="s2">or pain pushing yourself into places or</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:44.140" style="s2">training yourself to do to enter states</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:46.870" style="s2">that normally would be difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.140" end="00:17:48.970" style="s2">access so that sort of thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.870" end="00:17:51.669" style="s2">the exogenous is you know introduced in</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.970" end="00:17:54.220" style="s2">whatever way so psychoactives are fairly</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.669" end="00:17:56.350" style="s2">classic but also things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.220" end="00:18:00.220" style="s2">strobing technologies there are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.350" end="00:18:01.720" style="s2">stuff the exposure to art or certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.220" end="00:18:04.900" style="s2">types of ritual right that are that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.720" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">happened to you and now of course you</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.900" end="00:18:08.860" style="s2">know things like non-invasive brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:10.090" style="s2">stimulation and their feedback and right</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.860" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">these sorts of technologies that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:14.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t have access to but that do allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">us to intervene on our state so is there</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.650" end="00:18:20.230" style="s2">a programmatic recommendation here like</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:21.879" style="s2">start with the endogenous stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.230" end="00:18:23.859" style="s2">because you talked about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.879" end="00:18:25.929" style="s2">variation and then do you move into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.859" end="00:18:29.259" style="s2">cyclic technology cyclo technological</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.929" end="00:18:33.279" style="s2">and then perhaps only like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.259" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">with you know a good guy or therapist I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.279" end="00:18:37.359" style="s2">think it there&#39;s so yes a good guide in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:40.330" style="s2">the therapist so right the general rule</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.359" end="00:18:42.489" style="s2">around altered states is you should</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.330" end="00:18:43.749" style="s2">always have safe containment right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.489" end="00:18:45.190" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing with psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.749" end="00:18:46.389" style="s2">it&#39;s been known for a long time if</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.190" end="00:18:48.549" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna engage in this stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.389" end="00:18:49.989" style="s2">need to have a sitter minimally and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.549" end="00:18:51.399" style="s2">probably you should have a sitter that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.989" end="00:18:53.289" style="s2">has some experience and you should</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.399" end="00:18:55.419" style="s2">control percent and setting and all that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.289" end="00:18:56.950" style="s2">stuff is pretty primitive like I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.419" end="00:18:58.899" style="s2">often say it&#39;s like set and setting is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.950" end="00:19:00.850" style="s2">very yeah yeah you know that I argue</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.899" end="00:19:02.169" style="s2">about expensive yeah yeah right and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.850" end="00:19:04.029" style="s2">you look at like the Griffiths work</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.169" end="00:19:05.139" style="s2">around psilocybin you can see that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.029" end="00:19:06.580" style="s2">really want to have things a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.139" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">controlled if you&#39;re gonna start getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.580" end="00:19:09.519" style="s2">in the mystical experience territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:11.529" style="s2">sorry that that a lot of that research</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.519" end="00:19:13.119" style="s2">shows that a lot of these profound</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.529" end="00:19:15.070" style="s2">benefits of using the psychedelics are</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.119" end="00:19:17.590" style="s2">in conjunction with therapeutic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.070" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">right yeah so in I mean I just recommend</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.590" end="00:19:21.249" style="s2">therapy to everybody I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">should think I think we should think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.249" end="00:19:26.200" style="s2">therapy as less like emergency medicine</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">and more like nutrition well more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.200" end="00:19:30.190" style="s2">some combination of a personal trainer I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:32.499" style="s2">used to say dentist but people a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.190" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">people are afraid of dentists so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.499" end="00:19:36.190" style="s2">stopped using that analogy I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:38.590" style="s2">afraid of the dentist so it never</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.190" end="00:19:41.499" style="s2">occurred to me foot yeah but you know a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.590" end="00:19:43.090" style="s2">personal trainer or or even something</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.499" end="00:19:45.220" style="s2">like basic preventive medicine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.090" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">you go to the doctor every six months or</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.220" end="00:19:47.350" style="s2">whatever for a checkup and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:49.450" style="s2">checkup</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.350" end="00:19:51.789" style="s2">but people typically only get into</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.450" end="00:19:52.809" style="s2">psychotherapy when they&#39;re yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.789" end="00:19:54.789" style="s2">already feel like they&#39;re about to so</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.809" end="00:19:58.749" style="s2">maybe another analogy might be like sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.789" end="00:20:01.899" style="s2">of a Sifu within a dojo or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.749" end="00:20:03.909" style="s2">like sure yeah yeah so yeah so that is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.899" end="00:20:06.489" style="s2">general containing thing right you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.909" end="00:20:08.460" style="s2">play play safe have containment have</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.489" end="00:20:11.559" style="s2">some kind of integration and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.460" end="00:20:14.649" style="s2">decompression in mind yeah and then as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.559" end="00:20:16.989" style="s2">general program I mean a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.649" end="00:20:19.359" style="s2">about your comfort zone you know not all</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.989" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">altered states are for all people is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.359" end="00:20:22.629" style="s2">like is there kind of like a zone of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.940" style="s2">proximal development yes so this there</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.629" end="00:20:27.129" style="s2">is but the problem is that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:29.169" style="s2">sensitive area right I mean you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.129" end="00:20:31.570" style="s2">what you&#39;re telling somebody is like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.169" end="00:20:33.550" style="s2">know you stay stay inside your comfort</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.570" end="00:20:35.050" style="s2">zone the thing is that&#39;s not quite true</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.550" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">you actually won&#39;t be slightly outside</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.050" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">your comfort zone but simultaneously you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:41.560" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be urging people to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.020" style="s2">outside their comfort zone right right</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.560" end="00:20:46.780" style="s2">because so so there&#39;s a balancing act</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.020" end="00:20:49.060" style="s2">there there&#39;s I think and people differ</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.780" end="00:20:50.950" style="s2">right some people want to take small</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.060" end="00:20:52.660" style="s2">steps they might want to do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.950" end="00:20:54.850" style="s2">of dream work investigate a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:20:56.500" style="s2">of you know meditation and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.850" end="00:20:59.050" style="s2">maybe try a float tank or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.500" end="00:21:00.310" style="s2">other people want to load you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.050" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">twenty-four different things into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.310" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">catapult and launch them all at once and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.220" style="s2">so they&#39;re you know interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:08.740" style="s2">simultaneously doing ayahuasca and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:10.360" style="s2">holotropic breathwork and strobe stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.740" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">and suspending themselves from hooks I</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.360" end="00:21:16.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s a matter of preference and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:18.340" style="s2">and you know in general my</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.330" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">recommendation though is you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.340" end="00:21:24.940" style="s2">necessarily to go into the deeply exotic</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:26.440" style="s2">to achieve significant results okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.940" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">right if you spend enough time</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.440" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">meditating you&#39;re meditating in the old</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.580" style="s2">sense contemplating if you spend enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.340" end="00:21:36.340" style="s2">time analytically contemplating your</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.580" end="00:21:38.620" style="s2">interpersonal relationships you can do a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.340" end="00:21:39.700" style="s2">lot if you spend some time paying</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.620" end="00:21:41.530" style="s2">attention your dreams in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.700" end="00:21:43.810" style="s2">imagination like one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.530" end="00:21:45.880" style="s2">float up in your mind you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.810" end="00:21:47.890" style="s2">pick up all kinds of things right and if</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.880" end="00:21:49.480" style="s2">you want to move beyond that into you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.890" end="00:21:50.860" style="s2">know deeper fields of experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.480" end="00:21:52.510" style="s2">sort of a matter of temperament and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.860" end="00:21:54.340" style="s2">preference I think I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.510" end="00:21:57.730" style="s2">you&#39;re also perhaps also matter of skill</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.340" end="00:22:00.970" style="s2">yes yeah no I agree all right so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.730" end="00:22:02.890" style="s2">was an excellent answer for a very good</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.970" end="00:22:05.080" style="s2">question if there&#39;s another question I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.890" end="00:22:07.570" style="s2">want to ask you from Clara who&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.080" end="00:22:09.340" style="s2">patron now I thank you for the critique</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.570" end="00:22:12.580" style="s2">of the hero&#39;s journey I am left to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.340" end="00:22:14.350" style="s2">wonder however about the role of fear my</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.580" end="00:22:16.060" style="s2">felt sense is that the hero&#39;s journey is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.350" end="00:22:17.680" style="s2">all about conquering your deepest fears</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.060" end="00:22:21.610" style="s2">in order to improve your relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.680" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">world our fears aren&#39;t fears a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.610" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">source or even cause of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:29.780" style="s2">so I would I just wanna</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:33.300" style="s2">remind everybody that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.780" end="00:22:36.030" style="s2">that mythology isn&#39;t just not just myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.300" end="00:22:40.620" style="s2">of the hero&#39;s journey for every Odysseus</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.030" end="00:22:46.050" style="s2">and Jason there is you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.620" end="00:22:48.510" style="s2">Phaeton or an Icarus or Arachne and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.050" end="00:22:52.680" style="s2">hubris is talked about as much as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.510" end="00:22:54.090" style="s2">hero in a lot of Greek mythology for</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.680" end="00:22:56.340" style="s2">example and you were trying to say no no</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.090" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">you gotta set this all into a much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.340" end="00:22:59.970" style="s2">comprehensive almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:02.340" style="s2">self-correcting system rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.970" end="00:23:03.960" style="s2">focusing a little too much on the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.340" end="00:23:05.580" style="s2">journey so I&#39;d like you to comment on</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.960" end="00:23:08.730" style="s2">that in answering the question but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.580" end="00:23:10.410" style="s2">also want to slant it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.730" end="00:23:11.670" style="s2">towards something that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.410" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">last time in that I&#39;ve argued about is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.670" end="00:23:18.120" style="s2">also the role of mythology the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:21.390" style="s2">journey and the aspirational project</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.120" end="00:23:23.340" style="s2">mmm-hmm okay so on the first point I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.390" end="00:23:27.000" style="s2">guess but you know the role of fear in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.340" end="00:23:30.540" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey well I mean so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.000" end="00:23:33.240" style="s2">not sure first off yes it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.540" end="00:23:35.160" style="s2">fear is a significant obstacle in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.240" end="00:23:37.980" style="s2">ways although fear can also be an ally</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.160" end="00:23:39.180" style="s2">and this is a thing in many cases what</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.980" end="00:23:41.100" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with shadow work it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.180" end="00:23:43.080" style="s2">about conquering well that was my point</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.100" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">about hubris right yeah versus not</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.080" end="00:23:46.350" style="s2">having an adequate fear of what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">should be afraid of right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.350" end="00:23:51.780" style="s2">so so fear can have utility now that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t come to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.780" end="00:23:55.650" style="s2">some kind of you know more balanced</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">relationship with it often right there</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.650" end="00:23:58.170" style="s2">are things that we fear that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">disproportionate or there are things</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.170" end="00:24:03.960" style="s2">that we feel where we are not in control</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:05.700" style="s2">of our fear but having some relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.960" end="00:24:07.410" style="s2">with fear you don&#39;t just want to remove</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.700" end="00:24:08.940" style="s2">fear know people that have no fear</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.410" end="00:24:11.610" style="s2">typically do not have great lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.940" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">mm-hmm right and we see this in cases of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.610" end="00:24:15.030" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:17.130" style="s2">developmental cases of fearless people</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.030" end="00:24:19.890" style="s2">and there are cases right where people</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.130" end="00:24:21.900" style="s2">have sustained you know bring their</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.890" end="00:24:23.490" style="s2">brain insolia right and and they have no</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.900" end="00:24:26.190" style="s2">fear and that&#39;s a problem right</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.490" end="00:24:28.500" style="s2">fearlessness can be a problem it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.190" end="00:24:30.660" style="s2">lead you into dangerous situations that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.500" end="00:24:32.550" style="s2">said for the most part we tend to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.660" end="00:24:36.300" style="s2">kind of excess of fear and our</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.550" end="00:24:37.110" style="s2">relationship to it is a fearful one if</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.300" end="00:24:39.240" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.110" end="00:24:40.970" style="s2">yeah and that needn&#39;t necessarily be so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.240" end="00:24:43.550" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.970" end="00:24:45.290" style="s2">so okay so on the like things that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.550" end="00:24:47.240" style="s2">can do in an altered state territory a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.290" end="00:24:49.250" style="s2">game that I sometimes recommend to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.240" end="00:24:50.210" style="s2">people if they have this particular case</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.250" end="00:24:52.610" style="s2">it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.210" end="00:24:54.740" style="s2">werewolf so here&#39;s the game you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.610" end="00:24:56.870" style="s2">of tapping into some leftover machinery</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:24:58.820" style="s2">I think from earlier in evolution so</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.870" end="00:25:01.220" style="s2">here&#39;s a game go on a camping trip with</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.820" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">your friends have a fire in the woods be</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.220" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">careful about that and then once it gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">good and dark walk in the forest ideally</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:11.660" style="s2">an open stretch and walk far enough away</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.190" end="00:25:13.820" style="s2">from the fire that you can sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.660" end="00:25:16.310" style="s2">it out a bit you have a clear path and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.820" end="00:25:18.700" style="s2">then turn around and run back to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.310" end="00:25:21.170" style="s2">fire in the dark as fast as you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.700" end="00:25:22.790" style="s2">almost immediately after you start doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.170" end="00:25:25.220" style="s2">this and my experience and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.790" end="00:25:27.290" style="s2">people I know you&#39;ll begin to have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.220" end="00:25:29.660" style="s2">terrible like atavistic sensation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.290" end="00:25:31.640" style="s2">being chased because I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.660" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">many times in our history didn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.640" end="00:25:35.330" style="s2">back to the fire through the woods with</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">something after us right so it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.330" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">contours and constellated this fear</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:40.970" style="s2">thing and and it&#39;s a terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">experience I mean I&#39;ve undergone it a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.970" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">bunch of times and it sounds like fun</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.010" end="00:25:46.700" style="s2">and games until you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:47.870" style="s2">like okay it sounds like so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.700" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">ever done it right it&#39;s like roller</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.870" end="00:25:51.560" style="s2">coasters it&#39;s sort of a horror movies</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:55.040" style="s2">right I also like it&#39;s a matter of taste</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.560" end="00:25:57.230" style="s2">but but the point is in doing that one</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.040" end="00:25:58.040" style="s2">is directly moving towards of fear and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.230" end="00:25:59.810" style="s2">you&#39;re coming to a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.040" end="00:26:01.970" style="s2">relationship to your fear than simply</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.810" end="00:26:04.190" style="s2">being fearful your fear can be a set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.970" end="00:26:06.680" style="s2">experiences that you have but that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.190" end="00:26:08.840" style="s2">can process as sort of useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.680" end="00:26:12.560" style="s2">information in some cases or an ally</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:14.540" style="s2">without it being an unconscious dominant</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.560" end="00:26:16.250" style="s2">right without losing agency to it in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.540" end="00:26:18.230" style="s2">same way so instead of just soft right</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.250" end="00:26:20.450" style="s2">yet yeah and actually that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.230" end="00:26:24.290" style="s2">flecked on it you can reflect on it so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.450" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">you know I think that when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.290" end="00:26:27.770" style="s2">about the hero&#39;s journey you know in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:29.030" style="s2">that sense you&#39;re potentially overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.770" end="00:26:31.220" style="s2">a lot of things I mean there are worse</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.030" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">things than fear there are worse things</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.220" end="00:26:35.450" style="s2">than fear I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:38.570" style="s2">meaninglessness is worse than fear right</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.450" end="00:26:41.240" style="s2">fear at least is sort of motivating but</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.570" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">when you you know traipse into a patch</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.240" end="00:26:43.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:46.040" style="s2">you know nihilism yeah you stumble in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.880" end="00:26:47.990" style="s2">this world s pond where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.040" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">nothing nothing moves you in any</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.990" end="00:26:51.980" style="s2">direction you just kind of want to lay</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">down a die that is worse than fear yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.980" end="00:26:54.380" style="s2">fear at least will move you with</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:56.120" style="s2">something you can work with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.380" end="00:26:58.850" style="s2">something you can write whereas often</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.120" end="00:27:01.190" style="s2">you know nihilism and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.850" end="00:27:02.600" style="s2">unanswerable the absurd can be very</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.190" end="00:27:04.670" style="s2">difficult answer I was thinking you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.600" end="00:27:06.890" style="s2">there&#39;s all there&#39;s even you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.670" end="00:27:08.510" style="s2">mythical elements of people heroes</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.890" end="00:27:10.610" style="s2">getting stuck in the doldrums right or</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.510" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">the slough of despond yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:14.120" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:15.980" style="s2">or Odysseus on the island of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.120" end="00:27:17.090" style="s2">lotus-eaters writings like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.980" end="00:27:20.930" style="s2">interesting I think of that as an</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.090" end="00:27:22.790" style="s2">intoxication story right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.930" end="00:27:24.530" style="s2">true but they sort of lose motivation at</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.790" end="00:27:26.300" style="s2">the same time yeah yeah I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.530" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">straight-three we just did the Odyssey</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.300" end="00:27:30.380" style="s2">in my course because I do it every year</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:31.880" style="s2">right and of course there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.380" end="00:27:33.680" style="s2">series of things where these</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.880" end="00:27:35.720" style="s2">accompanying figures for the DCs all</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.680" end="00:27:37.370" style="s2">sort of regrets right they don&#39;t lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.720" end="00:27:40.430" style="s2">consciousness they turn into pigs they</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.370" end="00:27:42.740" style="s2">right he has to drag them out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.430" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">opium den so to speak right the Lotus</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.740" end="00:27:47.470" style="s2">Eaters so yeah there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:50.060" style="s2">those so I think that yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.470" end="00:27:53.570" style="s2">overcoming fear is an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.060" end="00:27:55.940" style="s2">that overall journey but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.570" end="00:27:57.680" style="s2">only thing and in fact right like it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.940" end="00:27:59.240" style="s2">be equally important all this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.680" end="00:28:00.500" style="s2">typically balanced you&#39;ve gotten sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.240" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to integrate opposites</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.500" end="00:28:06.980" style="s2">right so it can be just as hard to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:08.660" style="s2">to overcome the heroic components of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.980" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">your site right right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.660" end="00:28:14.360" style="s2">so an example of this is people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">suffer excessive ambition right which</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.360" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">can be a kind of heroic inflation where</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:22.520" style="s2">you know that kind of like I can do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:24.170" style="s2">my attitude pushes too hard on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.520" end="00:28:26.150" style="s2">psyche and then you start to cruise</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.170" end="00:28:28.670" style="s2">towards burnout alright right people and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.150" end="00:28:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a very widespread and reported so</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.670" end="00:28:34.310" style="s2">again there&#39;s a writer&#39;s laughing with</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.040" end="00:28:35.720" style="s2">recognition the there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.310" end="00:28:37.970" style="s2">of a back and forth and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.720" end="00:28:40.250" style="s2">that you can sort of pick one one thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.970" end="00:28:41.900" style="s2">in a sense and tag that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.250" end="00:28:45.650" style="s2">something else coming up that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.900" end="00:28:47.540" style="s2">negotiated yeah and then above them</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.650" end="00:28:48.990" style="s2">beyond that negotiating the heroic</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.540" end="00:28:51.690" style="s2">archetype itself which is what I play</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.990" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">right so did we get into the dream with</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.690" end="00:28:55.950" style="s2">Siegfried I think I mentioned it but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:28:58.049" style="s2">maybe didn&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.950" end="00:29:00.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous dream that mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.049" end="00:29:04.110" style="s2">memories dreams reflections where young</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.679" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">sniper rifle and he blows the Solar hero</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.110" end="00:29:08.669" style="s2">away blow sleep Siegfried the dragon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:11.460" style="s2">lair away then he has horrible guilt and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.669" end="00:29:13.320" style="s2">then you know a massive storm washes</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.460" end="00:29:15.929" style="s2">away and he feels this immense relief</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.320" end="00:29:18.600" style="s2">that nobody will discover the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.929" end="00:29:20.250" style="s2">of his crimes there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.600" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">there but one of the things is that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.250" end="00:29:24.630" style="s2">know he wakes up from that and as he</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">starts to chew through it he&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.630" end="00:29:29.880" style="s2">right I have to kill the solar hero in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:32.309" style="s2">myself because that lowering that kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.880" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">of confrontational adversarial gogogo</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.309" end="00:29:38.490" style="s2">externally focused energy it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:40.049" style="s2">to move in a state of more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:42.210" style="s2">equanimity and balance that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.049" end="00:29:44.039" style="s2">characterizes wisdom you you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.210" end="00:29:45.419" style="s2">great because you actually I think did a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.039" end="00:29:47.159" style="s2">lot towards answering my second point</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.419" end="00:29:49.080" style="s2">which is that the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.159" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">aspiration is an anatomic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.080" end="00:29:52.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the hero&#39;s journey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">right there&#39;s a sense yes you you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:29:56.429" style="s2">take the step forward but then you also</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">have to right you have to then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.429" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">internalize the patterns that you learn</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:02.669" style="s2">about there&#39;s much about there&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:04.890" style="s2">appreciation in the sense of learning</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.669" end="00:30:06.809" style="s2">understanding coming to have new</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.890" end="00:30:08.429" style="s2">preferences and values as there is and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.809" end="00:30:09.990" style="s2">just sort of making the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.429" end="00:30:11.610" style="s2">that&#39;s involved in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.990" end="00:30:13.100" style="s2">aspiration yeah that&#39;s right and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.610" end="00:30:16.590" style="s2">you know these things have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.100" end="00:30:19.020" style="s2">shifting I mean there are values and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.590" end="00:30:21.450" style="s2">challenges associated with stages of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.020" end="00:30:23.490" style="s2">life and I think that we used to have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.450" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">better recognition of that in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.490" end="00:30:26.460" style="s2">culture right there are unique</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">challenges that come with particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.460" end="00:30:30.600" style="s2">phases of life and to making emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:34.350" style="s2">transitions into those and then dealing</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.600" end="00:30:36.510" style="s2">with those particular issues right is is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.350" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">often central to the process of going</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.510" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">through some kind of psychic growth so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">young talks about this you know when he</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:44.039" style="s2">says the first half of life and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:46.110" style="s2">obviously he&#39;s generalizing here but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.039" end="00:30:48.059" style="s2">first half of life is is external</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.110" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">it&#39;s an extroverted half here challenge</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.059" end="00:30:51.990" style="s2">in the world and building stuff up and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:53.399" style="s2">doing all that heroic stuff and taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:54.840" style="s2">it on and building yourself a career and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.399" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">building yourself a persona and getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.840" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">status and then the second half of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:04.450" style="s2">post 35 is turning inwards</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">and right trying to process through the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.450" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">nature of being who you are right what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:12.429" style="s2">your legacies are death yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:14.679" style="s2">lines up with the the shifting of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">temporal horizon right so people until</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.679" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">they&#39;re 35 they live from their birth</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:19.990" style="s2">yeah and then after 35 they start living</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">towards their death that&#39;s right now I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.990" end="00:31:24.039" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that&#39;s totally true in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.450" end="00:31:26.710" style="s2">all respects like I disagree with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.039" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">that you can&#39;t do any important right</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.710" end="00:31:32.110" style="s2">inner work right no 35 but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:34.360" style="s2">interesting that traditionally before</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:36.220" style="s2">you can train as a union analyst you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.360" end="00:31:38.289" style="s2">can&#39;t train if you&#39;re under 35 right you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">can&#39;t even begin because the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.289" end="00:31:43.419" style="s2">is that you don&#39;t have the requisite</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:45.820" style="s2">life experience and depth and stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.419" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">even start the process here I think in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.820" end="00:31:49.450" style="s2">Toronto it&#39;s not 30 I think it&#39;s 30 well</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:51.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the same age Plato recommended</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.450" end="00:31:52.809" style="s2">that right yeah so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.429" end="00:31:54.220" style="s2">because that also like I said it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.809" end="00:31:56.019" style="s2">reflects that sort of cognitive factor</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.220" end="00:31:58.600" style="s2">that the temporal horizon flips around</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.019" end="00:31:59.649" style="s2">out at that stage yeah ok let&#39;s pass on</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.600" end="00:32:08.190" style="s2">to another question if that&#39;s okay with</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.649" end="00:32:10.899" style="s2">you sure so this is from a patreon</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.190" end="00:32:13.509" style="s2">McKenzie Levitt who that&#39;s also somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.899" end="00:32:15.879" style="s2">who writes to me and she asked how</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.509" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">should we apply self compassion in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.879" end="00:32:21.009" style="s2">process of shadow work judiciously okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:24.669" style="s2">so could you expand on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.009" end="00:32:26.649" style="s2">sure um so are we using self compassion</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.669" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s Neph technical sense here I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.649" end="00:32:32.259" style="s2">wonder the problem I have with that by</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">the way is I I have deep arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.259" end="00:32:34.990" style="s2">that being sort of theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:36.460" style="s2">incoherent and bordering on self</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.990" end="00:32:38.169" style="s2">contradictory right I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.460" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">language of training thing yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.169" end="00:32:41.470" style="s2">think it&#39;s also you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:43.300" style="s2">theoretical there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.470" end="00:32:46.510" style="s2">circularity even in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.300" end="00:32:47.230" style="s2">the analysis of that yeah so do what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.510" end="00:32:49.870" style="s2">want to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.230" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">like this is always an you might the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.870" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">other head against this yeah and I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:55.870" style="s2">that there are so it&#39;s a contested space</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">so I&#39;ll approach it I guess maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.870" end="00:32:59.530" style="s2">like the colloquial so we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:02.800" style="s2">self-compassion playing with shadow work</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.530" end="00:33:04.930" style="s2">um I think it is necessary when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.800" end="00:33:09.490" style="s2">doing shadow work to be realistic about</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.930" end="00:33:11.980" style="s2">the harms that you are inflicting while</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.490" end="00:33:13.930" style="s2">still bearing in mind that harms to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.980" end="00:33:16.300" style="s2">yourself or other both okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.930" end="00:33:18.910" style="s2">while still bearing in mind that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.300" end="00:33:22.300" style="s2">have a responsibility to attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.910" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">address those things right but that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">lot of it was unconscious like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:29.710" style="s2">balancing act with all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:32.560" style="s2">the thing that I say most often is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.710" end="00:33:34.270" style="s2">explanation isn&#39;t an excuse mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.560" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">but before vacation</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.270" end="00:33:40.900" style="s2">yeah but nor is an excuse right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:44.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not an excuse so in a sense it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.900" end="00:33:46.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get you off the Hulk right but</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.410" end="00:33:48.420" style="s2">at the same time you often need to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.420" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">kind of easy on yourself it&#39;s contextual</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.420" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">this shifts around a lot I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:54.400" style="s2">people are more inclined to sort of let</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:56.380" style="s2">themselves off the hook right they</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.400" end="00:33:59.350" style="s2">project onto other people it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.380" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">fault we talked about this before and in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.350" end="00:34:03.790" style="s2">that case sometimes the sort of locus of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:06.400" style="s2">control and also the locus of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.790" end="00:34:08.530" style="s2">responsibility needs to shift inward so</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.400" end="00:34:10.360" style="s2">guilt is not a bad thing that should</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.530" end="00:34:13.060" style="s2">always be noted No</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.360" end="00:34:15.429" style="s2">yeah Nora shame it&#39;s just that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.060" end="00:34:17.610" style="s2">often misapplied or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.429" end="00:34:20.760" style="s2">disproportionately so let me thank</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.610" end="00:34:23.230" style="s2">counterbalances for all my criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.760" end="00:34:25.310" style="s2">network sort of you know scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.230" end="00:34:27.350" style="s2">and what we just said about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.310" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">the we need a more balanced attitude</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.350" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">towards guilt and shame you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:35.720" style="s2">our mutual friend Leo and he has often</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:40.970" style="s2">said of me that I have a sadistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.720" end="00:34:44.270" style="s2">super-ego as his way of and so it did</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.970" end="00:34:45.950" style="s2">he&#39;s there is that the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.270" end="00:34:49.580" style="s2">that this question might be addressing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.950" end="00:34:51.590" style="s2">the concern that you know because</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.580" end="00:34:52.940" style="s2">people&#39;s upbringing or perhaps their the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.590" end="00:34:54.530" style="s2">religious formation or some comp</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.940" end="00:34:56.179" style="s2">combination of Constitution and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.530" end="00:34:58.010" style="s2">upbringing they might have I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.179" end="00:34:59.390" style="s2">like the friggin language but you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.010" end="00:35:01.940" style="s2">wanna talk about just to do sadistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.390" end="00:35:03.530" style="s2">super-ego yeah I mean I think so like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.940" end="00:35:04.910" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing shadow work as we</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.530" end="00:35:06.470" style="s2">mentioned there are sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.910" end="00:35:08.900" style="s2">aspects to it so some of it is some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.470" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">this golden shadow retrieval stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.900" end="00:35:12.740" style="s2">you&#39;re going back and you&#39;re pulling out</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:14.870" style="s2">aspects and you&#39;re doing an aspect shift</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.740" end="00:35:16.700" style="s2">on them to recognize that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.870" end="00:35:18.170" style="s2">necessarily bad to begin with or that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.700" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">there was no reason to abandon them</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.170" end="00:35:22.370" style="s2">right that can include things from your</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:25.400" style="s2">childhood but also just traits that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.370" end="00:35:27.320" style="s2">chose one path over the other because of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.400" end="00:35:29.030" style="s2">emotional reasons or associated whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.320" end="00:35:30.920" style="s2">your reasons were and you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.030" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">reassess those things oh wait maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.920" end="00:35:35.660" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not so bad and and I can</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:38.420" style="s2">have that back or maybe I didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.660" end="00:35:40.430" style="s2">throw that away so the golden shadow</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.420" end="00:35:42.380" style="s2">stuff when we&#39;re talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.430" end="00:35:45.020" style="s2">deep dark personal shadows stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.380" end="00:35:46.700" style="s2">collective shadow stuff well then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.020" end="00:35:48.290" style="s2">the 2:00 in the morning confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">with yourself it&#39;s looking at yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.290" end="00:35:55.190" style="s2">in the mirror and recognizing oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:57.740" style="s2">been a right the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.190" end="00:35:59.270" style="s2">is if you don&#39;t have sort of experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.740" end="00:36:01.570" style="s2">and control and balance that&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.270" end="00:36:04.250" style="s2">for that to turn into self flagellation</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.570" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">depression right you&#39;re in implode right</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.250" end="00:36:08.750" style="s2">right so you know I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:12.020" style="s2">there is you know a one-size-fits-all</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.750" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">answer that you have no no I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.020" end="00:36:16.520" style="s2">think you were right but what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:18.980" style="s2">you know where the self compassion come</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.520" end="00:36:20.510" style="s2">in judiciously right it&#39;s applied where</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.980" end="00:36:22.580" style="s2">it needs to be applied and when I say</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.510" end="00:36:24.830" style="s2">judiciously I mean like there is there</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.580" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">is a judgement so lots of discernment is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.830" end="00:36:29.960" style="s2">needed that&#39;s right yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:32.330" style="s2">and frankly a lot of it as most things</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.960" end="00:36:34.310" style="s2">is sort of trial and error this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.330" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">say that moving outside of your comfort</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.310" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">zone is almost unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:40.820" style="s2">but this is again where I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.250" style="s2">where tradition can help because if</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.820" end="00:36:45.650" style="s2">tradition can set up banks of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.250" end="00:36:47.180" style="s2">constraints so the variation on our</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.650" end="00:36:49.100" style="s2">trial and error sure doesn&#39;t take so</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.180" end="00:36:51.470" style="s2">long and he paul banach later said</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.100" end="00:36:54.140" style="s2">something I thought I really liked he</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.470" end="00:36:57.560" style="s2">said you know your culture is good if</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.140" end="00:36:59.390" style="s2">it&#39;s got resources so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.560" end="00:37:01.010" style="s2">acquire wisdom through the culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.390" end="00:37:03.580" style="s2">faster than you possibly could on your</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.010" end="00:37:06.590" style="s2">own yes yeah I think that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.580" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">recommendation yeah I agree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.590" end="00:37:13.370" style="s2">interesting it seems to me that young</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:15.650" style="s2">often appeals to kind of lone wolf</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.370" end="00:37:17.900" style="s2">alchemists but people who really want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.650" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">do the spiritual project all on their</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">own right and there is obviously some</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:24.530" style="s2">community stuff around it I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.840" style="s2">belong to some communities around it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.530" end="00:37:28.760" style="s2">but the notion of alchemy as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.840" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">model for how the stuff works is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.760" end="00:37:33.770" style="s2">you are working in solitaire and encode</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:36.440" style="s2">there is a kind of an obscure artist but</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.770" end="00:37:38.090" style="s2">also this heroic yeah almost Faustian</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.440" end="00:37:40.700" style="s2">kind of approach to it where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.090" end="00:37:42.830" style="s2">coming at it all on your own and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.700" end="00:37:45.140" style="s2">know that certainly wasn&#39;t the case sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.830" end="00:37:47.240" style="s2">of with early people around you that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.140" end="00:37:48.830" style="s2">an intense and lively community of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.240" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">discussion well young that also had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.830" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">committee at core bad right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:56.390" style="s2">and right arrows those arrows lectures</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.890" style="s2">but other analysts so I agree I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.390" end="00:38:00.890" style="s2">know you want the stuff framed inside</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.890" end="00:38:02.120" style="s2">wisdom traditions and even if you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.890" end="00:38:04.090" style="s2">know to whatever extent you are within</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.120" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">an operating tradition that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.090" end="00:38:09.530" style="s2">also you know despite lousy saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:12.230" style="s2">you know books of the leaves and scum of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.530" end="00:38:13.970" style="s2">dead men there&#39;s a lot to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.230" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">gained from the wisdom traditions that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.970" end="00:38:18.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve accumulated in the last you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:22.070" style="s2">seven thousand years for sure right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.980" end="00:38:24.110" style="s2">drawing that stuff in often allows you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.070" end="00:38:26.180" style="s2">to take a certain amount of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.110" end="00:38:28.220" style="s2">that can give you some guidance where</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.180" end="00:38:29.780" style="s2">you might not otherwise have it to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.220" end="00:38:32.510" style="s2">where to put the boundaries but even</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.780" end="00:38:33.800" style="s2">still you&#39;re bound to overstep because</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.510" end="00:38:35.660" style="s2">it&#39;s the nature of exploring the space</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.800" end="00:38:38.780" style="s2">that sometimes you&#39;re going to put your</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.660" end="00:38:41.210" style="s2">foot someplace that hurts and so in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.780" end="00:38:43.340" style="s2">those cases if it if you&#39;re on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.210" end="00:38:44.239" style="s2">of exploding sometimes right a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.340" end="00:38:46.939" style="s2">self compassion</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.239" end="00:38:48.529" style="s2">necessary sometimes what I advise my</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.939" end="00:38:49.759" style="s2">clients to do if they&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.529" end="00:38:53.029" style="s2">something really hard that&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.759" end="00:38:55.669" style="s2">area it&#39;s like tell them to move the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.029" end="00:38:57.439" style="s2">line of their free will around so what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.669" end="00:38:59.239" style="s2">mean by this is like try to shift</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.439" end="00:39:02.029" style="s2">yourself around from a state of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.239" end="00:39:04.129" style="s2">like right trying to feel as though you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.029" end="00:39:05.239" style="s2">exist in a state of agency and free will</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.129" end="00:39:07.489" style="s2">and your banking choices</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.239" end="00:39:09.529" style="s2">right but occasionally to move over into</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.489" end="00:39:11.719" style="s2">a state of determinism and we do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.529" end="00:39:12.799" style="s2">anyway to take away pain we say well it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.719" end="00:39:15.229" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be any different</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.799" end="00:39:17.389" style="s2">yes it is what it is yeah right we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.229" end="00:39:19.279" style="s2">you know like well I don&#39;t would I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.389" end="00:39:20.779" style="s2">made different choices like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.279" end="00:39:22.759" style="s2">things are ways of pushing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.779" end="00:39:25.369" style="s2">into a more deterministic framework</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.759" end="00:39:26.749" style="s2">because it removes a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.369" end="00:39:29.389" style="s2">the pain and guilt of personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.749" end="00:39:30.769" style="s2">responsibility but then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.389" end="00:39:32.449" style="s2">problem with that is that then we feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.769" end="00:39:33.769" style="s2">like we have no agency and no control</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.449" end="00:39:36.019" style="s2">right right so then we swing the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.769" end="00:39:37.579" style="s2">way but then we have is a very flight</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.019" end="00:39:40.339" style="s2">there&#39;s gap right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.579" end="00:39:41.989" style="s2">and so moving around in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.339" end="00:39:43.399" style="s2">especially moving you know if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.989" end="00:39:45.559" style="s2">yourself being really stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.399" end="00:39:48.439" style="s2">experiencing a lot of pain moving around</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.559" end="00:39:50.239" style="s2">in that space is often part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.439" end="00:39:51.529" style="s2">of that and so self compassion it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.239" end="00:39:53.269" style="s2">to the extent that the slider moves</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.529" end="00:39:55.189" style="s2">towards determinism you can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.269" end="00:39:57.559" style="s2">yourself more and more self self</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.189" end="00:39:59.059" style="s2">compassion right because it wasn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.559" end="00:40:01.069" style="s2">is what as you move the other way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.059" end="00:40:02.479" style="s2">gonna rain into so complain that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.069" end="00:40:07.429" style="s2">that&#39;s very helpful Anderson let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.479" end="00:40:10.369" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is a question from</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.429" end="00:40:12.229" style="s2">Danielle of Posse how does the breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.369" end="00:40:13.939" style="s2">of the nomological order relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.229" end="00:40:16.159" style="s2">current world who you perspective clash</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.939" end="00:40:19.159" style="s2">of economy and ecology or perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.159" end="00:40:20.809" style="s2">Nomos and logos in another sense given</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.159" end="00:40:22.369" style="s2">the two worlds problem I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.809" end="00:40:24.529" style="s2">referring there to the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.369" end="00:40:26.239" style="s2">mythology that I criticized in you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.529" end="00:40:28.609" style="s2">in and awakening the meat from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.239" end="00:40:30.709" style="s2">meaning crisis with a useful geometric</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.609" end="00:40:33.379" style="s2">metaphor of the no more logical order be</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.709" end="00:40:38.089" style="s2">orthogonal maximal contrast rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.379" end="00:40:39.679" style="s2">bipolar maximal conflict Wow okay that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.089" end="00:40:42.069" style="s2">was a lot of theoretical moves in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.679" end="00:40:44.989" style="s2">short space yeah I was impressed by that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.069" end="00:40:46.069" style="s2">was cool okay so so sorry let me take</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.989" end="00:40:47.869" style="s2">this to room you only do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.069" end="00:40:49.249" style="s2">read it again yeah yeah go through it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.869" end="00:40:50.419" style="s2">maybe I can address it and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.249" end="00:40:52.609" style="s2">point by point yeah that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.419" end="00:40:53.410" style="s2">I&#39;m of anomalous order relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.609" end="00:40:55.540" style="s2">current world</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.410" end="00:40:57.730" style="s2">perspective clash of economy and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.540" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">so he&#39;s he&#39;s saying radically but though</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.730" end="00:41:01.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the the Noma logic order for</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.640" style="s2">reasons articulated or eliminating for</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.930" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">the meeting crisis but we still do have</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.640" end="00:41:08.320" style="s2">these opponent opposing opposites right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">like the economy and the ecology or</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.320" end="00:41:11.710" style="s2">perhaps even I almost or logos well I</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:12.940" style="s2">mean the first thing I would say is of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.710" end="00:41:16.030" style="s2">course that the dichotomy between</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.940" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">economy and ecology is is stupid</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.030" end="00:41:19.780" style="s2">right if that&#39;s a bad it&#39;s a bad move</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:22.810" style="s2">the idea that those things are opposed</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.780" end="00:41:23.830" style="s2">is a very poor conceptualizing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.810" end="00:41:25.750" style="s2">question all right so second the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.830" end="00:41:28.090" style="s2">question criticising our culture right</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.750" end="00:41:30.790" style="s2">when so when we have that split between</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.090" end="00:41:31.690" style="s2">ecology and economy I mean I guess we</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.790" end="00:41:34.060" style="s2">could say that they both start with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.690" end="00:41:36.790" style="s2">Eco don&#39;t they like what basis could the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.060" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">economy possibly have except in ecology</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.790" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">what what meaning would have at some</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.480" style="s2">level we have to admit that the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:47.080" style="s2">economics and of the moving around of</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.940" end="00:41:53.770" style="s2">make a life and if it&#39;s not that then I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:57.010" style="s2">don&#39;t get it we just move and gold</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.770" end="00:41:59.320" style="s2">around on the moon you know so but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.010" end="00:42:01.090" style="s2">actually right traditional economics and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.320" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a criticism of economics just</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.090" end="00:42:03.610" style="s2">of the way that it implements sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.470" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">sort of treats it that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.610" end="00:42:08.830" style="s2">economics exists in a space of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:11.710" style="s2">infinite growth right and infinite</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.830" end="00:42:13.240" style="s2">growth is not is not a thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.710" end="00:42:15.310" style="s2">world it&#39;s certainly not a thing within</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.240" end="00:42:17.590" style="s2">a finite ecological system but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.310" end="00:42:19.750" style="s2">where we actually live you know likewise</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.590" end="00:42:23.710" style="s2">as we&#39;ve moved to a more abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.750" end="00:42:25.450" style="s2">notional ideas within economics that has</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.710" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">value because those things can zip</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.450" end="00:42:28.900" style="s2">around right like as efforts we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:30.880" style="s2">manipulate them we can twist them we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.900" end="00:42:33.580" style="s2">derive things we can write we can do all</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.880" end="00:42:35.500" style="s2">kinds of fascinating things with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.580" end="00:42:37.420" style="s2">sort of high abstract conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.500" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">material but the further we remove it</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.420" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">from food the further we go from having</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:45.100" style="s2">a sense of what economics is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.930" style="s2">be talking about which is the movement</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.100" end="00:42:48.970" style="s2">of value and value at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.930" end="00:42:51.430" style="s2">has to be about sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.970" end="00:42:52.820" style="s2">sustaining human life at least that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.430" end="00:42:55.730" style="s2">I mean maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.820" end="00:42:58.190" style="s2">green on this okay no I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.730" end="00:42:59.360" style="s2">fine the second part of the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:00.890" style="s2">that you wanted to address was in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.360" end="00:43:02.540" style="s2">another sense given the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.890" end="00:43:04.100" style="s2">problem would a useful geometric</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.540" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">metaphor of the numa logical order be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.100" end="00:43:11.180" style="s2">orthogonal maximal contrast rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:12.740" style="s2">bipolar maximal conflict that so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.180" end="00:43:16.010" style="s2">trying to say is there a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.740" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">could perhaps restructure yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.010" end="00:43:19.850" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar so that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:21.290" style="s2">move out of this oppositional mode which</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.850" end="00:43:22.970" style="s2">is in alignment with yeah basically what</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.290" end="00:43:25.370" style="s2">you just said yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.970" end="00:43:28.070" style="s2">yes but not I think I would have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.370" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">think about that more deeply the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.070" end="00:43:32.360" style="s2">key question yeah it&#39;s neat it&#39;s an e</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a neat question so I like the set</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.360" end="00:43:36.110" style="s2">of moves I would have to sit and think</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">about it I think maybe at length that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.110" end="00:43:39.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough one to do off the top my</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.550" end="00:43:42.320" style="s2">head intuitively it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.890" end="00:43:44.210" style="s2">answer is yes but I always want to check</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.320" end="00:43:45.740" style="s2">intuition against rational procedure</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.210" end="00:43:46.940" style="s2">well the part of the difficult we were</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.740" end="00:43:49.370" style="s2">facing and this is no criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.940" end="00:43:52.280" style="s2">Daniel is he&#39;s proposing a metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.370" end="00:43:53.240" style="s2">what you know working out what aspects</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.280" end="00:43:54.470" style="s2">of the metaphor we&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.240" end="00:43:56.750" style="s2">picking up a little requires some</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.470" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">community discussion right yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.750" end="00:44:03.670" style="s2">mean yeah my gut says yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">cool like works for me but you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.670" end="00:44:07.160" style="s2">first you have the intuition of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">insight and then you sit down and do the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.160" end="00:44:11.120" style="s2">hard work of checking you proof right</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:13.550" style="s2">okay so yeah so I&#39;d have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.120" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s a cool idea I would encourage</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.550" end="00:44:18.920" style="s2">you to like expand and articulate that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:20.300" style="s2">idea okay please do so all right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.920" end="00:44:26.870" style="s2">gonna shift to some live questions a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.300" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">couple right so this is from cuase to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.870" end="00:44:31.550" style="s2">tour how do we know what kind of therapy</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:35.630" style="s2">might be useful for us specifically oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.550" end="00:44:36.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a good one okay well so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.630" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">few different answers I could give to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.920" end="00:44:42.140" style="s2">that question one is I mean like most</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:44.660" style="s2">therapists I think these days I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.140" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">have an eclectic standpoint I don&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.660" end="00:44:49.670" style="s2">it eclectic or integrative that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:54.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a matter of you know is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.670" end="00:44:56.420" style="s2">self-care or self hacking you know so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.370" end="00:44:57.830" style="s2">well there&#39;s a philosophic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.420" end="00:45:00.020" style="s2">philosophical difference okay so it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.830" end="00:45:02.840" style="s2">integrative but as you know I hold my</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.020" end="00:45:04.140" style="s2">integrations lightly I don&#39;t force an</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.840" end="00:45:06.270" style="s2">integration where I</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.140" end="00:45:09.150" style="s2">don&#39;t think that it sort of do right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.270" end="00:45:11.190" style="s2">I probably I&#39;m an eclectic properly</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.150" end="00:45:13.590" style="s2">speaking but I mean you know making</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.190" end="00:45:15.420" style="s2">strong intellectual and personal efforts</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.590" end="00:45:18.030" style="s2">to integrate things so I just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.420" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">succeeded in doing it yet and actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.030" end="00:45:20.790" style="s2">maybe I should touch on that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:22.830" style="s2">succeeded in doing it yet for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.790" end="00:45:24.090" style="s2">important reasons right like a thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.830" end="00:45:25.800" style="s2">that I bring up with my students but</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.090" end="00:45:27.570" style="s2">also with my colleagues regularly is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.800" end="00:45:30.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of running set of battles</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.570" end="00:45:32.280" style="s2">about the theoretical basis of therapy</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.600" end="00:45:34.740" style="s2">of psychotherapy right right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.280" end="00:45:37.140" style="s2">you consider something like CBT right</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.740" end="00:45:38.550" style="s2">the core idea on CBT right one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.140" end="00:45:40.650" style="s2">core ideas comes out of Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">stoicism and it&#39;s the thought comes</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.650" end="00:45:44.790" style="s2">first so if you control the thought and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:46.050" style="s2">there is a circularity to it but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.790" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">thought comes first you control the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.050" end="00:45:50.190" style="s2">thought you control the feeling well</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:52.980" style="s2">EFT which was a mode that I trained in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.190" end="00:45:55.290" style="s2">has precisely the opposite it&#39;s none of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.980" end="00:45:57.570" style="s2">the feeling comes first and the actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.290" end="00:46:00.330" style="s2">answer to this question drumroll please</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.570" end="00:46:02.850" style="s2">is we don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.330" end="00:46:04.920" style="s2">how it works yet yeah we don&#39;t we know</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.850" end="00:46:07.410" style="s2">you won&#39;t have evidence for both we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.920" end="00:46:09.330" style="s2">evidence both lots of therapies in</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.410" end="00:46:11.970" style="s2">different modes perform approximately</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.330" end="00:46:13.860" style="s2">equally well right and these are report</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.970" end="00:46:16.350" style="s2">the single best predictor so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.860" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">thing we have a kind of pre post</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.350" end="00:46:21.780" style="s2">blackbox right assessment model around</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">psychotherapeutic efficacy that shows</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.780" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">that yeah there are definitely some</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:26.730" style="s2">factors that are important rapport</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:29.010" style="s2">accounts for depending on the study you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.730" end="00:46:31.470" style="s2">look at between 50 and 70 percent which</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.010" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">is a huge is huge yeah it&#39;s huge I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.470" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">if you and if you think about it that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:37.950" style="s2">way the you know the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.480" style="s2">what therapy is good for you is know</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.950" end="00:46:40.860" style="s2">what therapists yeah that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.480" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">gonna say doesn&#39;t that change the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.860" end="00:46:44.430" style="s2">question and you should shop around yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.290" style="s2">you should shop around like any</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.430" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">relationship and it is a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.290" end="00:46:49.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a human relationship it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:51.420" style="s2">relationship of psychological intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.530" end="00:46:52.710" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right I mean even more so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.420" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">like I would encourage people to shop</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.710" end="00:46:56.520" style="s2">around for the doctor you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:58.080" style="s2">necessarily go to the first doctor go to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.520" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">a doctor that you feel that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.080" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">good working relationship with and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:05.010" style="s2">don&#39;t almost have that option but right</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:07.800" style="s2">likewise even more so with therapy like</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.010" end="00:47:08.940" style="s2">see one and see how you hit it off like</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.800" end="00:47:10.860" style="s2">do you have a good working relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.940" end="00:47:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s possibly your complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.860" end="00:47:14.100" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna interlock in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.090" end="00:47:18.090" style="s2">gonna make the work almost impossible</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.100" end="00:47:19.980" style="s2">but also just it might not be your style</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.090" end="00:47:22.080" style="s2">so since rapport accounts for so much of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.980" end="00:47:23.580" style="s2">the effect the question you know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.080" end="00:47:26.070" style="s2">therapist are you looking for and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.580" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">course with all things you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.070" end="00:47:29.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like a normal distribution so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:31.800" style="s2">want to try to find one that you think</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.220" end="00:47:34.200" style="s2">is good and one that you think can keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.800" end="00:47:35.730" style="s2">up with your concerns right one that has</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.200" end="00:47:40.080" style="s2">the training that you want is one and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.730" end="00:47:41.400" style="s2">forth above and beyond that I think some</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.080" end="00:47:42.690" style="s2">of it&#39;s a matter of taste and some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.400" end="00:47:45.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of what issues you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.690" end="00:47:47.730" style="s2">working on so if you are doing things</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.900" end="00:47:51.180" style="s2">like CBT for instance I think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.730" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">terrific tool right it&#39;s a tool and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.180" end="00:47:55.260" style="s2">good for certain kinds of things if what</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:56.970" style="s2">people are experiencing is like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.260" end="00:47:58.950" style="s2">onslaught of negative thoughts they</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.970" end="00:48:00.930" style="s2">can&#39;t control CBT can be very effective</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.950" end="00:48:03.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s worth learning anyway so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.930" end="00:48:04.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a terrific tool to learn if on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.150" end="00:48:08.040" style="s2">other hand what they&#39;re having is you</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.620" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">know a set of deep unresolved issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.040" end="00:48:13.290" style="s2">right around say you know an absent</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:15.570" style="s2">parent or something right but an absent</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.290" end="00:48:18.540" style="s2">might mean dead and it might mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.570" end="00:48:19.980" style="s2">inaccessible and it mean missing and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.540" end="00:48:21.720" style="s2">might be emotionally distant and right</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.980" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">well there are techniques for that like</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.720" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">there&#39;s the empty chair technique which</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:26.790" style="s2">is for unfinished business so</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:28.830" style="s2">emotionally focused therapy users are</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.790" end="00:48:31.530" style="s2">using it borås it from just all to come</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.830" end="00:48:33.140" style="s2">at it at all but yeah so EFT might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.530" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking for in that context</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.140" end="00:48:37.560" style="s2">likewise if what you&#39;re looking to do is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:40.020" style="s2">sort of deep meaning based work about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.560" end="00:48:42.420" style="s2">the narrative arc of your life what it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.020" end="00:48:44.610" style="s2">means to be you well then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.420" end="00:48:46.980" style="s2">doing CBT for the most part now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.610" end="00:48:48.870" style="s2">doing something depth and when you look</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.980" end="00:48:50.970" style="s2">at the profiles of these therapies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.870" end="00:48:54.540" style="s2">they perform approximately as well but a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.970" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">few years ago it was Sweden switched</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.540" end="00:48:58.080" style="s2">over their healthcare system I should</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:00.030" style="s2">really check this reference but switched</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.080" end="00:49:02.460" style="s2">over the healthcare system entirely to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.030" end="00:49:03.660" style="s2">CBT they went all in on CBT they were</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.460" end="00:49:06.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s what we offer without for</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.660" end="00:49:09.720" style="s2">CBT and in some ways it was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.750" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">disaster right and but interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.720" end="00:49:13.770" style="s2">what they did after that was tracked the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:16.350" style="s2">relative relative efficacy of CBT</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.770" end="00:49:18.670" style="s2">against depth right again sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.350" end="00:49:20.950" style="s2">psychodynamic depth second</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.670" end="00:49:22.300" style="s2">peas and you know psychodynamic deb</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.950" end="00:49:25.360" style="s2">psychotherapies have taken a beating</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.300" end="00:49:27.430" style="s2">because CBT has managed to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.360" end="00:49:30.100" style="s2">establish itself as the empirical the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.430" end="00:49:32.050" style="s2">evidence base the evidence-based therapy</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.100" end="00:49:34.930" style="s2">but actually what you see in the profile</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.050" end="00:49:37.630" style="s2">in the study is that CBT has a strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.930" end="00:49:39.700" style="s2">initial response but often that efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.630" end="00:49:41.140" style="s2">and usefulness falls over time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.700" end="00:49:44.350" style="s2">whereas depth tends to build over time</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.140" end="00:49:46.150" style="s2">yeah so one one is I mean you&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.350" end="00:49:48.220" style="s2">it one is more cognitive intervention</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.150" end="00:49:50.170" style="s2">the other is more existential yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.220" end="00:49:58.390" style="s2">you know the general answer I would give</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.170" end="00:50:01.150" style="s2">as a collective integrationist is do</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.390" end="00:50:02.650" style="s2">both again you want a variety of tools</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.150" end="00:50:04.120" style="s2">it sort of depends what you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.650" end="00:50:05.860" style="s2">on but you always want to be working</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.120" end="00:50:07.180" style="s2">with a variety of tools because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.860" end="00:50:09.850" style="s2">going to tend to balance each other off</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.180" end="00:50:11.410" style="s2">all of you yeah an ecology you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.850" end="00:50:14.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.410" end="00:50:17.410" style="s2">but if you put enough discount items</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.320" end="00:50:18.820" style="s2">into the basket yeah right at least they</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.410" end="00:50:22.270" style="s2">balance each other out that was a weird</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.820" end="00:50:25.780" style="s2">mixed metaphor but I like it okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.270" end="00:50:27.190" style="s2">here&#39;s one from Alex Levy yeah what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.780" end="00:50:29.790" style="s2">the best way to understand Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.190" end="00:50:29.790" style="s2">archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.940" end="00:50:36.490" style="s2">what&#39;s the best way to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:39.430" style="s2">well what might be helpful to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.490" end="00:50:41.410" style="s2">let&#39;s rule out some popular alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.430" end="00:50:43.600" style="s2">that might be misleading right as a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.410" end="00:50:46.210" style="s2">of zeroing in rather than trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.600" end="00:50:48.910" style="s2">sort of an a priori definition okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.210" end="00:50:51.880" style="s2">one thing that I would stay away from is</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.910" end="00:50:54.700" style="s2">trying to essentialize them right people</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.880" end="00:50:57.070" style="s2">really want the list then want the list</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:50:59.290" style="s2">in the map right so they want a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.070" end="00:51:00.970" style="s2">map that has fixed structures and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.290" end="00:51:03.850" style="s2">want a fixed Lix list with fixed</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.970" end="00:51:04.900" style="s2">properties sort of a cast of characters</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.850" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">at the beginning of the drama</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.900" end="00:51:08.590" style="s2">yeah even more than that they want</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.490" end="00:51:10.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s really structural right</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.590" end="00:51:12.310" style="s2">so it&#39;s like what what&#39;s this and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.270" end="00:51:14.200" style="s2">it do and it reminds me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.310" end="00:51:15.940" style="s2">actually a functional localization in</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.200" end="00:51:18.520" style="s2">neuroscience oh right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.940" end="00:51:20.110" style="s2">right because like we really want the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.520" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">brain to be a map of Europe and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.110" end="00:51:23.800" style="s2">like oh Lichtenstein is where you do</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.619" style="s2">your language process and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.800" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">work of Michael Anderson has</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.619" end="00:51:29.009" style="s2">radically undermining that with them</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:30.930" style="s2">yeah massive redeployment but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.009" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">connection networks and me you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.930" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2">whole thing is much much messier plus</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:36.420" style="s2">they&#39;re all your brain cells are all</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:39.749" style="s2">squirming around in there yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.420" end="00:51:41.369" style="s2">anyway so you know people want to fix</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.749" end="00:51:43.230" style="s2">the map and they want a fixed cast and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.369" end="00:51:47.160" style="s2">you should abandon both of those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.230" end="00:51:49.499" style="s2">the the nature of the thing is more like</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.160" end="00:51:51.299" style="s2">a concept and concepts of blurry</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.499" end="00:51:52.859" style="s2">boundaries and they contain each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.299" end="00:51:54.509" style="s2">they can swallow each other they can</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.859" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">have relationships with each other that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.509" end="00:51:56.819" style="s2">are more complex than sort of hard</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:51:59.549" style="s2">boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.819" end="00:52:02.220" style="s2">it&#39;s very rare outside of pure math and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.549" end="00:52:04.349" style="s2">maybe fundamental physics to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.220" end="00:52:06.119" style="s2">get like a concept that you can nail</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.349" end="00:52:08.009" style="s2">down to an Aristotelian list with an</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.119" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">essence right so are they kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.009" end="00:52:13.499" style="s2">big continuing family resemblance thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:14.999" style="s2">yeah I think so so that&#39;s one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.499" end="00:52:16.799" style="s2">that you sort of want to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.999" end="00:52:18.779" style="s2">trying to nail them down in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.799" end="00:52:21.809" style="s2">now you can get a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.779" end="00:52:23.279" style="s2">sense of archetypal material by I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.809" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that you only focused</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.279" end="00:52:28.650" style="s2">on myth and that primarily actually von</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:31.380" style="s2">Franz his follower got really in a fairy</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.650" end="00:52:35.309" style="s2">tale fairy tale is really interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.380" end="00:52:38.180" style="s2">part because as I say fairy tales don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.309" end="00:52:40.470" style="s2">contain psychologies they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.180" end="00:52:42.509" style="s2">psychologies the characters and fairy</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.470" end="00:52:44.759" style="s2">tales don&#39;t they don&#39;t have psychology</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.509" end="00:52:46.769" style="s2">the are psychology and what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.759" end="00:52:49.230" style="s2">like you know there once was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.769" end="00:52:51.150" style="s2">woodcutter and he lived in the woods and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.230" end="00:52:53.339" style="s2">there was a wolf you don&#39;t get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.150" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">interior tea yeah but what you get is</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.339" end="00:52:59.069" style="s2">this sense of the the typological past</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:01.890" style="s2">interacting in certain ways and being</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.069" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">able to do analysis on that - trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.890" end="00:53:05.069" style="s2">drill into their psychology you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:07.470" style="s2">what I mean I think not getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.069" end="00:53:10.589" style="s2">homunculus with them this is for</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.470" end="00:53:13.230" style="s2">instance why I have deep beef with Shrek</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.589" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">and wicked</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.230" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the other one the Angelina Jolie</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:21.540" style="s2">one remotely so the lip Maleficent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:23.190" style="s2">with a sense costume looks great but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.540" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like please stop muddying this</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.190" end="00:53:27.090" style="s2">stuff up you&#39;re gonna gonna mangle kids</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:30.900" style="s2">first they need nice clean categories to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.090" end="00:53:33.480" style="s2">move this stuff around anyway um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.900" end="00:53:34.740" style="s2">you can do interesting work now if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.480" end="00:53:36.119" style="s2">just dive in and start reading that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.740" end="00:53:38.940" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s not that helpful you would</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.119" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">want to do that with an eye to reading</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.940" end="00:53:42.900" style="s2">some of the analysts who have done that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:45.180" style="s2">work and certainly loads and loads of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.900" end="00:53:47.310" style="s2">analytical work unpacking that stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.180" end="00:53:48.060" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the bread and butter of sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.310" end="00:53:50.550" style="s2">of mid-century</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.060" end="00:53:52.619" style="s2">this means a theological question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.550" end="00:53:57.960" style="s2">because if they&#39;re vacant Tinian like</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.619" end="00:54:01.380" style="s2">games yeah yeah like it&#39;s how would any</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.960" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">claim be open to dis confirmation right</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.380" end="00:54:06.060" style="s2">well okay so the thing is that then</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.080" end="00:54:07.740" style="s2">right that&#39;s about making general</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.060" end="00:54:09.990" style="s2">investigation of why why are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.740" end="00:54:12.300" style="s2">this well ultimately speaking what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.990" end="00:54:14.490" style="s2">want to do of course is learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.300" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">pick up phenomenological markers in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.490" end="00:54:18.840" style="s2">experience mmm right because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">this game is really about so does it</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.840" end="00:54:24.090" style="s2">shift from being a theoretical account</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:26.130" style="s2">more to being like a path of training</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.090" end="00:54:28.170" style="s2">and transformation yeah yeah totally yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.130" end="00:54:30.210" style="s2">that that&#39;s why you know it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.170" end="00:54:31.830" style="s2">get stuck if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.210" end="00:54:34.140" style="s2">Jungian psychology and just doing like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.830" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">endless and I like doing this right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.140" end="00:54:39.000" style="s2">analyses of films and books and comics</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:40.710" style="s2">and novels and fairy tales right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.000" end="00:54:42.930" style="s2">that&#39;s fine you can get really</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.710" end="00:54:44.700" style="s2">interesting stuff out of that but if</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.930" end="00:54:46.890" style="s2">you&#39;re not then re grounding that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.700" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">experience of mythology or fairy tale or</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.890" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">story in that high abstract sense if</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:51.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not regrinding in the lived</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:54.420" style="s2">experiences and you&#39;re missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.960" end="00:54:58.770" style="s2">so you compare it&#39;s a fair region system</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.420" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">I just want to make sure I get the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.770" end="00:55:02.730" style="s2">empirical confirmation is in the degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:04.109" style="s2">to which it facilitates sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.730" end="00:55:06.150" style="s2">long-term transformation that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.109" end="00:55:07.770" style="s2">that&#39;s right so I mean you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.150" end="00:55:09.420" style="s2">think of it experimentally right that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.770" end="00:55:11.220" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay well maybe I should</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.420" end="00:55:13.020" style="s2">interact with it this way based on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.220" end="00:55:15.270" style="s2">and then you see the results and of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.020" end="00:55:17.940" style="s2">course it&#39;s the kind of anecdote driven</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.270" end="00:55:19.740" style="s2">you know on on the ground and in the mud</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.940" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">sort of experiment that our lives are</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.740" end="00:55:23.730" style="s2">composed of right where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:26.329" style="s2">typically get nice clean test conditions</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.730" end="00:55:29.329" style="s2">hold rules and stuff but but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.329" end="00:55:31.789" style="s2">that we do you know sort of run little</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.329" end="00:55:33.469" style="s2">experiments in our lives well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.789" end="00:55:37.309" style="s2">what the Bayesian proposal is right</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.469" end="00:55:40.189" style="s2">totally so so you know so that is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.309" end="00:55:42.529" style="s2">sense in which you get it sort of as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.189" end="00:55:43.880" style="s2">lived experience and so all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.529" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">reading that you&#39;re doing around it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.880" end="00:55:48.679" style="s2">about trying to pick up the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:51.199" style="s2">structural phenomenological markers that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.679" end="00:55:52.939" style="s2">will enable you to start recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.199" end="00:55:54.289" style="s2">these things and then applying the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.939" end="00:55:56.209" style="s2">techniques so this means there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.289" end="00:55:58.910" style="s2">truth to this claim that some people</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.209" end="00:56:01.519" style="s2">made in the comment we to our last video</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.910" end="00:56:03.109" style="s2">like if you haven&#39;t gone through Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.519" end="00:56:05.329" style="s2">analysis and there&#39;s a deep sense in</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.109" end="00:56:07.880" style="s2">which you&#39;re not really understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.329" end="00:56:09.499" style="s2">because if the normative standard is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.880" end="00:56:11.420" style="s2">degree to which it&#39;s being implemented</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.499" end="00:56:13.579" style="s2">in transformation yeah then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.420" end="00:56:15.380" style="s2">really not applying the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.579" end="00:56:17.749" style="s2">normative standard which means you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.380" end="00:56:19.849" style="s2">be appropriately understanding it well</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.749" end="00:56:21.949" style="s2">look I wouldn&#39;t want to go too strong on</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.849" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">that ok why not cuz I&#39;d like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.949" end="00:56:27.039" style="s2">argument ok so I wouldn&#39;t want to go too</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:29.719" style="s2">strong on that because in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.039" end="00:56:32.929" style="s2">because people already interact with</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.719" end="00:56:35.150" style="s2">this material in a sort of a naive way I</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.929" end="00:56:37.609" style="s2">mean naive like they&#39;re they are unaware</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.150" end="00:56:39.469" style="s2">of Jungian material but they interact</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.609" end="00:56:41.509" style="s2">with the structures that are being</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.469" end="00:56:43.549" style="s2">described in a kind of any way right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.509" end="00:56:45.499" style="s2">being through Union analysis are going</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.549" end="00:56:47.749" style="s2">through Union analysis right it brings a</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.499" end="00:56:48.829" style="s2">particular focus and language to it that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.749" end="00:56:50.989" style="s2">helped shape it it&#39;s like any other</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.829" end="00:56:51.709" style="s2">community of practice you learn what</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.989" end="00:56:53.630" style="s2">things are called</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.709" end="00:56:56.449" style="s2">but it&#39;s all at the point look my point</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.630" end="00:56:57.979" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s a community of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.449" end="00:56:59.509" style="s2">practices that we establish our</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.979" end="00:57:02.809" style="s2">normative standards yeah and if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.509" end="00:57:05.239" style="s2">don&#39;t have that and if that community is</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.809" end="00:57:07.579" style="s2">aren&#39;t you gonna fall into inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.239" end="00:57:09.049" style="s2">issues of autodidactic bias and all</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.579" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">kinds of things when you&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.049" end="00:57:13.670" style="s2">this kind of you know it&#39;s as you argued</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not really tightly conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.670" end="00:57:18.289" style="s2">constrained right yeah I suppose so</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:19.819" style="s2">I mean if you just launched in if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.289" end="00:57:22.249" style="s2">just sat down what the collective works</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.819" end="00:57:24.979" style="s2">and read them end-to-end and attempted</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.249" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">to implement in that way could you yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.979" end="00:57:29.569" style="s2">sort of I think you could write you you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:33.259" style="s2">could take the kind of it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.569" end="00:57:35.500" style="s2">very uphill battle right and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.259" end="00:57:37.090" style="s2">a part of you that sort of enjoys that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.500" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">you know like the alchemical struggle of</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.090" end="00:57:41.140" style="s2">working through the great work and your</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:42.910" style="s2">own time and lots of people do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.140" end="00:57:44.290" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not the only person in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.910" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">world I think who does a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.290" end="00:57:50.320" style="s2">of like self development semi</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:52.180" style="s2">recreationally right right and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.320" end="00:57:53.710" style="s2">weird line right you sort of get you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:56.320" style="s2">become increasingly interested in your</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.710" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2">own pain and dysfunction not hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.320" end="00:58:00.610" style="s2">in a narcissistic way but rather as just</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.450" end="00:58:01.900" style="s2">like oh like I&#39;m doing the work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.610" end="00:58:04.270" style="s2">doing the work and it just becomes part</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.900" end="00:58:05.980" style="s2">of your day-to-day is being part of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.270" end="00:58:07.330" style="s2">community of practice and going through</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.980" end="00:58:09.370" style="s2">it and going through the established</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.330" end="00:58:11.800" style="s2">stuff like is that important of course</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.370" end="00:58:14.560" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that existing union</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.800" end="00:58:17.080" style="s2">practice is the last word in doing some</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.560" end="00:58:19.270" style="s2">kind of archetypal or depth work I see</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.080" end="00:58:20.770" style="s2">and so like people could be for example</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.270" end="00:58:24.430" style="s2">within a religious community and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.770" end="00:58:28.060" style="s2">accessing this material yeah yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.430" end="00:58:31.260" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good one so so I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.060" end="00:58:34.780" style="s2">paper a bunch of years ago for you</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.260" end="00:58:38.020" style="s2">although I think maybe Leo read it where</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.780" end="00:58:40.030" style="s2">I was talking about some Vajrayana</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.020" end="00:58:41.710" style="s2">Tibetan Buddhism and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.030" end="00:58:43.390" style="s2">talking about practices in Tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.710" end="00:58:46.770" style="s2">Buddhism that really interests me where</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.390" end="00:58:51.060" style="s2">you use a combination of ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.770" end="00:58:54.550" style="s2">meditation and prayer to visualize a</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.060" end="00:58:57.070" style="s2">artificial spirit or tutelary deity into</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.550" end="00:58:59.350" style="s2">a parent existence and autonomy okay so</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.070" end="00:59:01.030" style="s2">you&#39;re conjuring like a ghost or a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.350" end="00:59:02.650" style="s2">spirit in a sense right but it should</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.030" end="00:59:04.300" style="s2">have a parent autonomy it should be so</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.650" end="00:59:05.980" style="s2">solid and seemingly independent of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.300" end="00:59:07.990" style="s2">and then as soon as you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.980" end="00:59:10.030" style="s2">well you the idea is you dissolve it</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.990" end="00:59:11.350" style="s2">back into the pure light and in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.030" end="00:59:14.350" style="s2">you&#39;re giving yourself a direct</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.350" end="00:59:17.380" style="s2">experience of the fact that like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.350" end="00:59:19.750" style="s2">imaginal space right sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.380" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">creates reality within that system and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.750" end="00:59:25.240" style="s2">whatever when you&#39;re doing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:27.190" style="s2">stuff I mean the the connections between</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.240" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">you me and psychology and Tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.190" end="00:59:30.700" style="s2">Buddhism are all over the place is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">very Union kind of system it&#39;s all like</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.700" end="00:59:35.860" style="s2">gods that are very archetypal ii driven</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:38.200" style="s2">heavily symbolic right and using</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.860" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">techniques that you know in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.200" end="00:59:41.770" style="s2">other forms of Buddhism would be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:44.099" style="s2">you know slightly eyebrow-raising</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.770" end="00:59:45.689" style="s2">and yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.099" end="00:59:48.029" style="s2">you know they&#39;re doing all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.689" end="00:59:50.099" style="s2">and there&#39;s no mention of young they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.029" end="00:59:52.859" style="s2">just working with archetypal energies</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.099" end="00:59:54.869" style="s2">and materials I get that so yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.859" end="00:59:57.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a good okay that&#39;s a good and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.869" end="01:00:00.329" style="s2">actually if on the note of Tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.420" end="01:00:01.380" style="s2">Buddhism and and shadow right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.329" end="01:00:03.299" style="s2">cuz I think this is sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.380" end="01:00:05.459" style="s2">interesting anecdote I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.299" end="01:00:07.619" style="s2">interested in this this figure so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.459" end="01:00:09.479" style="s2">tend to think of Tibetan Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.619" end="01:00:11.189" style="s2">the Dalai Lama etc is having sort of no</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.479" end="01:00:13.799" style="s2">shadow alright that&#39;s a guy who does not</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.189" end="01:00:15.239" style="s2">seem to cast a shadow and they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.799" end="01:00:17.369" style="s2">obviously a very good reputation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.239" end="01:00:20.489" style="s2">they&#39;ve been quite hard done by and like</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.369" end="01:00:24.479" style="s2">no question right however there is a a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.489" end="01:00:26.670" style="s2">group a sacked in Tibetan Buddhism that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.479" end="01:00:29.670" style="s2">has been excommunicated by the Dalai</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.670" end="01:00:31.439" style="s2">Lama and they&#39;re a group that deals with</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.670" end="01:00:34.410" style="s2">an entity called a door Josh algodón</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.439" end="01:00:37.529" style="s2">right and or Shoshanna ban is like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.410" end="01:00:39.479" style="s2">Darth Vader of the Bodhisattvas right so</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.529" end="01:00:41.279" style="s2">there is an ongoing argument right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.479" end="01:00:43.140" style="s2">the Dalai Lama pushed these guys out</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.279" end="01:00:44.910" style="s2">because he basically said your demon</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.140" end="01:00:47.640" style="s2">worshippers and you&#39;re out this entity</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.910" end="01:00:49.890" style="s2">that you worship and communicate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.640" end="01:00:52.650" style="s2">and so on and so forth is bad news and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.890" end="01:00:55.890" style="s2">he should be gone and their response is</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.650" end="01:00:57.689" style="s2">you are a bigot and you&#39;re pushing us</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.890" end="01:01:00.779" style="s2">out you just don&#39;t understand the symbol</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.689" end="01:01:02.579" style="s2">see when he&#39;s drinking from the Goblet</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.779" end="01:01:04.890" style="s2">of blood what he&#39;s really doing is</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.579" end="01:01:06.900" style="s2">ingesting right the ruby red light of</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.890" end="01:01:08.729" style="s2">compassion and when he&#39;s chopping the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.900" end="01:01:11.670" style="s2">heads off of his enemies he&#39;s slaying</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.729" end="01:01:12.929" style="s2">ignorant sir right there&#39;s this symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.670" end="01:01:16.019" style="s2">recontextualization where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.929" end="01:01:17.880" style="s2">arguing about the hermeneutics right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.019" end="01:01:20.369" style="s2">and the kind of exegetical qualities</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.880" end="01:01:23.249" style="s2">around the symbol but but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.369" end="01:01:24.660" style="s2">a pure shadow yeah right there so in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.249" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">sense right that&#39;s some collective</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.660" end="01:01:28.949" style="s2">shadow stuff going on are they in or are</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:31.799" style="s2">they out and the question of doors yoga</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.949" end="01:01:34.679" style="s2">Dan for them you know you could easily</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.799" end="01:01:35.549" style="s2">interpret with a union lens but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.679" end="01:01:37.439" style="s2">don&#39;t need one</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.549" end="01:01:41.459" style="s2">Isis airily right you&#39;ve made that case</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.439" end="01:01:42.290" style="s2">that fair no I think that&#39;s - yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.459" end="01:01:45.109" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.290" end="01:01:47.900" style="s2">I think my argument holds but what what</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.109" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is it it&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.900" end="01:01:52.190" style="s2">point I was making about sort of being</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.560" style="s2">within a community of transformative</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.190" end="01:01:56.780" style="s2">practice doesn&#39;t have to be exhaustively</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.560" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">applied to just the Union community</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.780" end="01:02:00.830" style="s2">that&#39;s right I mean you know in Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:03.470" style="s2">point that you want to be within a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.830" end="01:02:05.180" style="s2">culture that facilitates yeah right that</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.470" end="01:02:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;reyou&#39;re the self appropriation of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.180" end="01:02:10.220" style="s2">your own development and and wisdom yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.820" end="01:02:11.690" style="s2">of course right you nobody wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.220" end="01:02:15.530" style="s2">in the culture that tries to put its</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.690" end="01:02:18.980" style="s2">boot on you know wisdom yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.530" end="01:02:20.930" style="s2">and and obviously that&#39;s helpful but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.980" end="01:02:23.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the Union community</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.930" end="01:02:24.410" style="s2">sort of super specifically I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.480" end="01:02:28.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough question</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.410" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">you know yeah so we&#39;ve come to the end</p>
