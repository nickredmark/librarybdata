<p begin="00:01:24.380" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">like I come from an a political stance</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;re just interested in stoicism sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:32.360" style="s2">of like stuff like this and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.080" end="00:01:35.120" style="s2">desire for me to just gauge in politics</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.360" end="00:01:36.860" style="s2">more in sort of a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.120" end="00:01:37.880" style="s2">interesting relevant to the stoah so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.860" end="00:01:39.560" style="s2">want to reach out to more voices</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.880" end="00:01:42.170" style="s2">especially on the Left we&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.560" end="00:01:47.120" style="s2">to do that and this is one attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.170" end="00:01:50.270" style="s2">that and so I will also say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.120" end="00:01:52.220" style="s2">usually I&#39;d like to do a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.270" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">due diligence and reading about my</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.220" end="00:01:55.130" style="s2">guests and I&#39;ve done a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:57.350" style="s2">that today but not as much as I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.130" end="00:01:59.270" style="s2">like so I&#39;m here a lot of people in room</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.350" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">learning about a meaner thought for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.270" end="00:02:05.270" style="s2">first time so I just wanted to flag that</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.270" end="00:02:07.509" style="s2">is going to work</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">I guess our first sort of we had done a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:46.169" style="s2">bunch of little projects but our first</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">like larger project was we did a couple</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.379" end="00:04:01.349" style="s2">sort of a founding voice in just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.699" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">like a future of work impact meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.349" end="00:04:08.940" style="s2">generator if that&#39;s buzzword enough for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.940" end="00:04:13.260" style="s2">so but we just kept rebellious data we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:17.549" style="s2">just like try to use data science and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.260" end="00:04:20.579" style="s2">impact evaluation and like other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.549" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">like that to sort help organizations</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.579" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">whose values we aligned with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:29.310" style="s2">leverage their leverage their work or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">dig deeper into the phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.310" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">they&#39;re dealing with when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">like we&#39;re trying to settle on a topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:39.990" style="s2">and I was probably being annoying I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">might just talk about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.990" end="00:04:42.590" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about what is your audience</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:46.010" style="s2">let me know what you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.590" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a few different threads</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.010" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">sort of like kind of like the discussing</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">that the reactionary all right movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">discussing sort of like the anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">feels thing that you&#39;re doing stuff a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:57.030" style="s2">project that you&#39;re working on with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:05:02.700" style="s2">Richard and we set along the future of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.030" end="00:05:03.690" style="s2">information so I wonder if if you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.700" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">share your thoughts on that just</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.690" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">generally in the movie we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">warming up with some questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">pivot to the group sure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:15.570" style="s2">information is this funny term because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like inherently big so I can grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.570" end="00:05:21.660" style="s2">to encompass lots of things but I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:24.270" style="s2">specifically study flows of information</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.660" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">and it did actually link all the topics</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.270" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">like um the reason I was first thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:32.970" style="s2">about it is because I know that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:35.910" style="s2">community or at least you particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.970" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">are interested in sort of meta mediation</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.910" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">of political groupings and as I told you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">my background was actually in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">mediation although more focusing on like</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:56.760" style="s2">violent conflicts then like ideological</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">political in-group out-group kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.760" end="00:06:05.400" style="s2">nationalism micro nationalisms so and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">then ultimately that led me to studying</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.400" end="00:06:10.590" style="s2">information more fair as I said and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.740" end="00:06:14.340" style="s2">like States and corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.590" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">ideologues and different groups use the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.340" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">internet to mobilize real-world violence</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:26.130" style="s2">or just like real world disarray to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">geopolitical ends I mean there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.130" end="00:06:33.420" style="s2">different no I&#39;m not going on at once</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:36.420" style="s2">and basically in that in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.420" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">world I started realizing that like</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.420" end="00:06:44.060" style="s2">highly centralized approaches were we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:46.770" style="s2">not that adaptive responsive and so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.060" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">see someone in a decentralized t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.770" end="00:06:52.790" style="s2">in trying that just they have larger</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.790" end="00:06:56.750" style="s2">and like there&#39;s a bunch of diseconomies</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:06:59.450" style="s2">of scale that go along with</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.750" end="00:07:00.410" style="s2">bureaucracies that were just like not</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.450" end="00:07:02.540" style="s2">good at handling it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.410" end="00:07:05.450" style="s2">the most notable be like an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.540" end="00:07:11.660" style="s2">example would be like white supremacists</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.450" end="00:07:13.580" style="s2">organizing because there there&#39;s a calm</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.660" end="00:07:17.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a combination of forces there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.580" end="00:07:19.970" style="s2">like grassroots interest in fascists and</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:48.650" style="s2">are emerging and creating these complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.130" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2">systems that move quite quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.650" end="00:07:53.510" style="s2">as like mass shootings started getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">gamified in the u.s. using like things</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.510" end="00:08:00.770" style="s2">like livestream and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:08:02.900" style="s2">that people were kind of scrambling to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.770" end="00:08:05.030" style="s2">keep up with what the internet was</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.900" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">already doing and the internet was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.030" end="00:08:10.580" style="s2">doing like what I&#39;ll call open source</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:12.280" style="s2">investigation and which isn&#39;t which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:14.300" style="s2">another field that I&#39;ve been like</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.280" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">training people in for the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.300" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">of years which is just like using the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:22.010" style="s2">power of the swarm or the collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">mind as you as you&#39;re all are calling it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.010" end="00:08:28.940" style="s2">here to intervene and analyze in a topic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:32.960" style="s2">and cover a lot more ground a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.940" end="00:08:37.790" style="s2">quickly and so people just started being</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.960" end="00:08:40.700" style="s2">like yeah this person who like violently</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.790" end="00:08:42.740" style="s2">oh we like tracked down these various</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.700" end="00:08:47.470" style="s2">pieces and figured out that it was this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.740" end="00:08:49.640" style="s2">person and those phenomena those like</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.470" end="00:08:57.730" style="s2">types of dealing with it tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:09:00.770" style="s2">quite agile I guess I would say and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.730" end="00:09:02.780" style="s2">yeah I started being interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.770" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">building building tools that would help</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.780" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">like researchers activists like lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.120" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">technologists various</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:19.660" style="s2">you analyze phenomena on the social</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">media because I also had because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.660" end="00:09:24.850" style="s2">data scientist I&#39;m pretty used to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:28.810" style="s2">you know going through random github</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.850" end="00:09:31.149" style="s2">repos and running command-line and or</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.810" end="00:09:33.819" style="s2">like mocking up like altering people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.149" end="00:09:36.670" style="s2">Python codes like make it serve some</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.819" end="00:09:39.129" style="s2">project that I want to do but most</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.670" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">people didn&#39;t have that capacity even in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.129" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">even in scholarly fields or even in with</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:46.060" style="s2">the journalists that I was working with</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why we eventually made</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.060" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">this website which I guess I can just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">share here we eventually made this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">website well we&#39;re making these like</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.660" style="s2">this suite of tools called SMAT the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:04.209" style="s2">social media analysis toolkit which was</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.660" end="00:10:07.269" style="s2">designed to let me know if that act if</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.209" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">that link doesn&#39;t work which was</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.269" end="00:10:15.579" style="s2">designed to help normal like</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:19.569" style="s2">non-technical people analyze emergent</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.569" end="00:10:28.809" style="s2">platforms and we&#39;re in the process of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.269" end="00:10:32.470" style="s2">Aladdin a lot more tools and adding a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.809" end="00:10:34.540" style="s2">lot more tools and JavaScript and adding</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.470" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">a lot more different data sources and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.540" end="00:10:43.149" style="s2">stuff like that we have very very cool</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:46.709" style="s2">team but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.149" end="00:10:49.800" style="s2">projects that we were working on and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.709" end="00:10:53.639" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:57.309" style="s2">information warfare in the US because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.639" end="00:11:00.309" style="s2">the there&#39;s like an ongoing Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.309" end="00:11:04.029" style="s2">through hybrid warfare tactics both from</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.309" end="00:11:10.230" style="s2">and against the US and social media is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.029" end="00:11:13.180" style="s2">obviously a platform for that and people</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.230" end="00:11:15.250" style="s2">both exaggerated and underestimate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.180" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">power of that because it&#39;s quite hard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.250" end="00:11:24.279" style="s2">measure second-order impacts of social</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:25.959" style="s2">social media information warfare BOTS</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.279" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">and all this stuff and like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.959" end="00:11:29.250" style="s2">times the method all</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.760" end="00:11:31.889" style="s2">these are terrible like Darius Kazemi</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.250" end="00:11:36.600" style="s2">and I have both been studying like bot</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.889" end="00:11:40.550" style="s2">detection stuff and it&#39;s like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.600" end="00:11:40.550" style="s2">the methods are like a pretty suspect</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">but like at the same time we gotta we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.490" end="00:11:49.589" style="s2">gotta study all these things so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">kind of a that&#39;s kind of a rambling on</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.589" end="00:11:56.730" style="s2">on that mean project that that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.990" end="00:12:02.269" style="s2">I guess I didn&#39;t really talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.730" end="00:12:06.630" style="s2">know kiss filled circle or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.269" end="00:12:10.440" style="s2">the like mutual exchange symposium that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.630" end="00:12:12.149" style="s2">we&#39;re running but oh I know one other</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.440" end="00:12:13.620" style="s2">thing that you and I discussed possibly</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.149" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">talking about here that would make me</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.620" end="00:12:18.839" style="s2">feel a little controversial which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:24.420" style="s2">that and I&#39;m happy to chat with people</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.839" end="00:12:28.769" style="s2">about this which is that I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.420" end="00:12:33.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a place for no platform in like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.769" end="00:12:37.800" style="s2">how we look at political intergroup</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.180" end="00:12:42.870" style="s2">mediation and I mean by that is I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.800" end="00:12:49.579" style="s2">believe that while free speech norms are</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.870" end="00:12:51.990" style="s2">incredibly important and we should build</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.579" end="00:12:58.170" style="s2">ideological immunities to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.990" end="00:13:02.209" style="s2">really heterodox ideas and we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.170" end="00:13:07.019" style="s2">like learn to think through really like</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.209" end="00:13:10.290" style="s2">complicated or taboo topics there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.019" end="00:13:12.899" style="s2">certain types of topics that it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.290" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">poisonous to the discourse to give a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.899" end="00:13:19.399" style="s2">large platform to even if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:24.360" style="s2">independent study with or like private</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.399" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">conversations with and I believe like</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:30.889" style="s2">fascism is one of those ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:34.980" style="s2">because of the way it sort of utilizes</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.889" end="00:13:40.140" style="s2">like ticks in the discourse sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.980" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">weird deep impulses and Pete</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.140" end="00:13:51.140" style="s2">to to sort of overcome like good you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.640" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">know stoic discourse it discursive norms</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.140" end="00:13:56.459" style="s2">the least you know the most obvious one</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:14:00.570" style="s2">being like the will to power or just</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.459" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">like I mean that the there&#39;s a scholar</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.570" end="00:14:04.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a scholarly definition of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:06.180" style="s2">fascism that&#39;s like challenged</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.050" end="00:14:08.610" style="s2">challenged and had a culture nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.180" end="00:14:11.579" style="s2">is it&#39;s called the the minimal</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.610" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">definition of fascism and what that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.579" end="00:14:19.829" style="s2">means is like an ultra nationalism that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:26.610" style="s2">has a birth a myth of rebirth caked into</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.829" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">it and that that ideology is has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.610" end="00:14:34.850" style="s2">this emotional potency because it says</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.440" end="00:14:37.709" style="s2">after we commit this ultra violence</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.850" end="00:14:39.510" style="s2">every every wrong that&#39;s been done to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.709" end="00:14:41.880" style="s2">you is going to be righted and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.510" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">gonna be the new leader and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.880" end="00:14:46.050" style="s2">dominate all your enemies and destroy</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">them and that&#39;s got this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.050" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">subcultural aid thing that that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:56.070" style="s2">kind of potent and so well what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:15:00.620" style="s2">organizers on the ground saw for a long</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.070" end="00:15:03.720" style="s2">time was that whenever like a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.620" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">platform would like invite on Richard</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.720" end="00:15:11.820" style="s2">Spencer for a debate or whatever even if</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:15.029" style="s2">even if that person was like countering</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.820" end="00:15:17.970" style="s2">their every point really carefully it</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.029" end="00:15:21.899" style="s2">would just really boost it would really</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.970" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">boost like recruitment and violent</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.899" end="00:15:29.370" style="s2">activity on the streets because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">central force of fascist ideology is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.370" end="00:15:34.470" style="s2">it&#39;s just a show of power and by being</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:36.329" style="s2">on a large platform you&#39;re making a show</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.470" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">of power and so it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.329" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">what was said</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:43.380" style="s2">and so that&#39;s anyways that&#39;s why the US</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:47.490" style="s2">only negotiates was like the Taliban and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.380" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">secret base argument there is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.490" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">you&#39;re always making choices about who</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.930" end="00:15:52.590" style="s2">you invite on your show</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">or whatever your show literally</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.590" end="00:15:59.280" style="s2">or anybody&#39;s show figuratively and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of like a which wolf do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.280" end="00:16:05.790" style="s2">feed thing and I get that it&#39;s delicate</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:08.280" style="s2">but I think that there are lines in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.790" end="00:16:10.920" style="s2">sand that are important to make and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.280" end="00:16:13.950" style="s2">last thing I&#39;ll say about that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.920" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">conscious tactic of white supremacist</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:23.190" style="s2">is basically just trying to and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.820" end="00:16:25.290" style="s2">is like up scholars it&#39;s very known that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.190" end="00:16:28.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like syncretic it can change shape</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.230" end="00:16:32.340" style="s2">ideology it&#39;s trying to infiltrate and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.180" end="00:16:34.230" style="s2">so you can make a sort of left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.340" end="00:16:36.120" style="s2">presenting version of it you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.230" end="00:16:43.590" style="s2">sort of far-right presenting version of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.120" end="00:16:47.820" style="s2">it and groups will very openly use those</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.590" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">inroads to recruit and slowly drive the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.820" end="00:16:54.930" style="s2">discourse into more and more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:58.200" style="s2">ultraviolent repression of minorities or</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.930" end="00:17:01.320" style="s2">whatever their end goal is and so i</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.200" end="00:17:03.660" style="s2">think especially communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.320" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">trying to engage in this like</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.660" end="00:17:14.190" style="s2">transcendent vision of political</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:16.680" style="s2">communities needs to have a very robust</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.190" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">understanding of how entry ism actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.680" end="00:17:20.790" style="s2">works in the real world regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:24.900" style="s2">how like an ideological free-market</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.790" end="00:17:27.270" style="s2">could or should I work and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.900" end="00:17:30.870" style="s2">my that was my maybe controversial take</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.270" end="00:17:33.780" style="s2">for the store I love it yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.870" end="00:17:36.210" style="s2">lot of juicy stuff there let me see</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.780" end="00:17:39.540" style="s2">where should I begin just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.210" end="00:17:42.390" style="s2">understand a portion of it you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.540" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">saying sort of how it&#39;s it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.390" end="00:17:47.640" style="s2">have your ideological immunities to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:49.650" style="s2">maybe have this like intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.640" end="00:17:51.470" style="s2">sandbox where you can kind of click</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.650" end="00:17:53.820" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate or explore these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.470" end="00:17:55.680" style="s2">or advocate to your own ideas I should</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.820" end="00:17:59.580" style="s2">say and explore ideas that are dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.680" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">but at the same time we should know</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.580" end="00:18:03.930" style="s2">platform certain people because of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">not information hazards but like mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.930" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">hazards that could emerge from it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:12.870" style="s2">that could basically hijack people so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.790" style="s2">that&#39;s true when you&#39;re having that sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.870" end="00:18:16.440" style="s2">of like engaging these ideas privately</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.790" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">is there certain ideas that should not</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.440" end="00:18:21.890" style="s2">be engaged in privately as well in order</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:25.670" style="s2">to like build that ideological immunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.890" end="00:18:28.260" style="s2">so when I first started researching</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.670" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">fascism like maybe five or six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.260" end="00:18:36.290" style="s2">and like more of a professional or</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:40.170" style="s2">scholarly capacity I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.290" end="00:18:46.800" style="s2">trawling this one particular board that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.170" end="00:18:53.130" style="s2">was like the most infamous and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.800" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">that mimetic mimetic contagion is a to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.130" end="00:18:57.660" style="s2">me I don&#39;t think of it as like a literal</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:59.610" style="s2">phenomena I think when people try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.660" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">study it as a literal phenomena it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.610" end="00:19:05.100" style="s2">a little murky I think it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:08.970" style="s2">powerful metaphor so I used it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.100" end="00:19:18.180" style="s2">and when I when I was like engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.970" end="00:19:19.890" style="s2">this board it was like it can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.180" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">hazardous to your mental health for one</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.890" end="00:19:25.380" style="s2">there&#39;s just like that basic notion like</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.410" end="00:19:28.110" style="s2">reading just like really really alarming</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.380" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">a lot of really alarming garbage for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.110" end="00:19:31.500" style="s2">long time can just like really degrade</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:34.800" style="s2">your mental health so there&#39;s that like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.500" end="00:19:38.910" style="s2">information hazard it but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.800" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">also so there&#39;s like another part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.910" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">this is that there&#39;s inherent limits to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.310" end="00:19:47.370" style="s2">what a brain can process meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:51.000" style="s2">and so when you get information overload</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.370" end="00:19:53.250" style="s2">it&#39;s quite common to just like accept</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.000" end="00:19:55.230" style="s2">some parts of it because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.250" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">the time to address it all in real term</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.230" end="00:20:04.440" style="s2">in real time and so like in in like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">going through a lot of this content and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.440" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">trying to engage with it even if even if</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">the points that are being made aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:15.960" style="s2">that good sometimes if you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.210" end="00:20:18.860" style="s2">have the mental capacity to like think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.960" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2">through every single point</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.860" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">you&#39;llyou&#39;ll in my experience later on</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:25.770" style="s2">find that you hadn&#39;t really challenged</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">one of these ideas and it had been just</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.770" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">kind of simmering in your brain and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.990" style="s2">also know it like comes out in some</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:36.690" style="s2">weird sideways way and then I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.990" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">that&#39;s bullshit but I didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.690" end="00:20:38.970" style="s2">that that was bullshit at the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:44.130" style="s2">because I was reading other things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.970" end="00:20:48.540" style="s2">were way way more bullshit and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.130" end="00:20:51.510" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the risks of like so if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.540" end="00:20:55.170" style="s2">are using the mimetic contagion metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.510" end="00:20:57.350" style="s2">that&#39;s why we do like we vaccinate you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.170" end="00:21:00.090" style="s2">know we don&#39;t just expose you to like</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.350" end="00:21:07.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t just like run into a crowd in</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">a pandemic normally to like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.320" end="00:21:12.330" style="s2">like gradually expose yourself until</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with norms and like</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.330" end="00:21:22.050" style="s2">deviations of a particular mutation so</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s like oh what came to mind there</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.050" end="00:21:25.890" style="s2">is like when I was doing research on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:28.530" style="s2">culture were more actively like going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.890" end="00:21:31.350" style="s2">that the chance and the Paul boards and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.530" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">just how like really nasty it can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.350" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">and dark with you know the anti-semitic</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">racist memes all the type of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:41.130" style="s2">it it wasn&#39;t always like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.870" style="s2">- it was almost like it they they did it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.130" end="00:21:44.730" style="s2">for my control at first but then just</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.870" end="00:21:46.680" style="s2">like you become what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.730" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">troll there you become what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.680" end="00:21:49.920" style="s2">pretending to be or whatever the troll</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:51.660" style="s2">that you&#39;re pertaining to be and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.920" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">they&#39;re actually become like white</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.660" end="00:21:57.240" style="s2">supremacists or Nazis or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:21:58.680" style="s2">yeah and if you just plug into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.240" end="00:21:59.880" style="s2">fortune just makes your body feel at</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.680" end="00:22:01.740" style="s2">least for me it just makes my body feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.880" end="00:22:06.540" style="s2">really nasty after an hour of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.740" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">that stuff so on sort of the I know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.540" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">did a paper on like - alright and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:14.340" style="s2">global information warfare and the you</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.650" style="s2">make the the stance that we should not</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.340" end="00:22:19.230" style="s2">platform certain people and I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.650" end="00:22:21.390" style="s2">question is where is the line that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.230" end="00:22:23.910" style="s2">draw there because when I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.390" end="00:22:26.970" style="s2">researching the more you say the white</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.910" end="00:22:29.400" style="s2">supremacist constellation of the medic</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.970" end="00:22:31.380" style="s2">tribes you can kind of tease them apart</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.400" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">at least in a propositional level like</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.380" end="00:22:34.020" style="s2">there&#39;s like wait identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:36.870" style="s2">who just want to be proud of being white</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.020" end="00:22:41.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s like white nationalists then</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.870" end="00:22:43.350" style="s2">there&#39;s like white supremacists and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.970" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">I think you can also make the argument</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.350" end="00:22:46.950" style="s2">that if you just kind of are attracted</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:48.690" style="s2">to one it could lead to the neither</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.950" end="00:22:50.760" style="s2">which could lead to another like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.690" end="00:22:52.590" style="s2">slippery slope type thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:54.570" style="s2">there&#39;s people like I don&#39;t know what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.590" end="00:22:56.160" style="s2">is now but stefan molyneux who&#39;s was</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.570" end="00:22:57.720" style="s2">gesturing strongly a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.160" end="00:22:59.100" style="s2">but I think he never really said he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.720" end="00:23:01.650" style="s2">it and then there&#39;s like Lauren southern</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.100" end="00:23:04.500" style="s2">who was like troll ish Lee may be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.650" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">of a troll but sort of like roles or</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.500" end="00:23:10.020" style="s2">that kind of constellation as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:11.430" style="s2">guess the question is where do you draw</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.020" end="00:23:14.010" style="s2">the line I&#39;m like okay these people</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.430" end="00:23:16.020" style="s2">should not be platformed well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.010" end="00:23:18.270" style="s2">convenient for me that you chose Lauren</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.020" end="00:23:21.990" style="s2">southern and stefan molyneux because</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.270" end="00:23:24.210" style="s2">stefan like started out as like well he</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.990" end="00:23:26.130" style="s2">just ideology hopped for a while but i</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.210" end="00:23:29.100" style="s2">remember like six years ago when he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.130" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">like I&#39;m a mutualist I&#39;m a libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.100" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">above this I&#39;m Ivette and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.780" style="s2">eventually he was just became a full</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:39.060" style="s2">like race realist</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.170" end="00:26:57.620" style="s2">definitely we have to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.280" end="00:27:00.500" style="s2">realities of pipelines pipelines exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.620" end="00:27:02.810" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want to be like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.500" end="00:27:05.570" style="s2">want to overreact in that caricature of</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.570" end="00:27:09.110" style="s2">are so delicate they can&#39;t handle ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.490" end="00:27:12.170" style="s2">and sort of feed into fascist propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.110" end="00:27:16.300" style="s2">though like they just hate us cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.170" end="00:27:19.190" style="s2">right you know like this thing so let me</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.300" end="00:27:20.930" style="s2">let me let me go here then first like</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.190" end="00:27:22.520" style="s2">you&#39;reyou&#39;re cutting up a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.930" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">unfortunately it looks like we missed</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.520" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">your spot on stefan molyneux impression</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.910" end="00:27:31.550" style="s2">so maybe if that ever comes again we</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.850" end="00:27:34.040" style="s2">will hopefully get that recorded but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.550" end="00:27:37.100" style="s2">so on Dugan so here&#39;s a confession time</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.040" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">so Michael Miller men who is the leading</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.100" end="00:27:40.490" style="s2">scholar of Alexander Duke and he was on</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.940" style="s2">the stoah he&#39;s a friend of mine he</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.490" end="00:27:45.140" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in Toronto he&#39;s a PhD in</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.940" end="00:27:47.750" style="s2">political science department and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.140" end="00:27:50.030" style="s2">almost didn&#39;t get his PhD because he</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.750" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">insisted on writing about Dugan but he</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.030" end="00:27:54.530" style="s2">ended up getting it and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">controversy there and through him I got</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.530" end="00:27:58.610" style="s2">interested in Dugan and I was reading he</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:01.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t fully read it read read it but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.610" end="00:28:03.050" style="s2">read the fourth political theory and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.430" end="00:28:04.580" style="s2">was fascinated by it that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.050" end="00:28:07.940" style="s2">arguments any mages from a very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.580" end="00:28:09.350" style="s2">philosophical area and I wasn&#39;t from I</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.940" end="00:28:11.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know the stuff that you just said</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.350" end="00:28:13.160" style="s2">about his connections with the ultras</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.810" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">movement so there&#39;s a thought that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.160" end="00:28:15.770" style="s2">popped in my head well wouldn&#39;t it would</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:18.140" style="s2">be interesting to talk to Duke and bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.770" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">him to the stoah and then that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.140" end="00:28:22.280" style="s2">motivated more out of at least visit my</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">reading I could be wrong with my own</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.280" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">read but motivated I was a curiosity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:29.660" style="s2">learn more about his ideas in that route</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.330" end="00:28:30.760" style="s2">so that being said what would your</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.660" end="00:28:33.910" style="s2">advice be to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.760" end="00:28:37.910" style="s2">so how much have you interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.910" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">other than your like academic friend how</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.910" end="00:28:41.870" style="s2">much have you interacted with like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:44.090" style="s2">actual do keenest s&#39; like on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.870" end="00:28:46.910" style="s2">internet or otherwise yeah practically</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.090" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">zero so there&#39;s a huge crossover with</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.910" end="00:28:56.090" style="s2">skinhead movements with like like racist</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:58.670" style="s2">street gangs and so if you if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.090" end="00:29:01.580" style="s2">like me and you and you&#39;ve liked spoken</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.670" end="00:29:04.360" style="s2">a little bit about like these gymnasts</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.580" end="00:29:07.040" style="s2">networks what happens is you get like</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.360" end="00:29:10.580" style="s2">really really weird people in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.040" end="00:29:12.440" style="s2">mentions and all of a sudden you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.580" end="00:29:17.270" style="s2">these people in your mentions talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.440" end="00:29:20.360" style="s2">about like a graciousness of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.270" end="00:29:22.850" style="s2">ubermensch and you&#39;re like how did this</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.360" end="00:29:24.530" style="s2">happen and the way that it happened like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.850" end="00:29:26.780" style="s2">I was just talking about this other</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.530" end="00:29:28.790" style="s2">abstract philosophical thing and the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.780" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">that it happens is like dog whistles</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.790" end="00:29:40.310" style="s2">basically and so like we like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.940" end="00:29:42.560" style="s2">bunch of these concrete examples that if</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.310" end="00:29:45.770" style="s2">you want I can like explain more later</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.560" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">of like people who roll in those circles</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.770" end="00:29:50.270" style="s2">like pepe escobar maybe would be an</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:52.070" style="s2">example of someone who&#39;s like a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.270" end="00:29:55.370" style="s2">bit of currency in the left but also has</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.070" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">currency on the far right spreads</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.370" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">conspiracy theories but also then slowly</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:05.150" style="s2">creeps in like hardcore anti-semitic</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:09.470" style="s2">contacts content and rolls really heavy</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.150" end="00:30:12.980" style="s2">with the with the do penis crowd so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:20.090" style="s2">think that what would happen is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.980" end="00:30:23.260" style="s2">would you would see yourself in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.090" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">position in this like enlightens</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.260" end="00:30:31.090" style="s2">ideological position of like engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:34.520" style="s2">with interesting topics and you would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.090" end="00:30:37.790" style="s2">encountering a person who has devoted</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.520" end="00:30:42.620" style="s2">his entire life to very strategic forms</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.490" end="00:30:52.280" style="s2">of that and what would secondary ELISA</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.840" end="00:30:54.110" style="s2">was theoretically play us out let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.280" end="00:30:56.299" style="s2">if I I brought Dugan in and then we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.110" end="00:30:57.770" style="s2">like a friendly exchange like you and I</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.630" end="00:31:26.660" style="s2">to some extent in his whole like his</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.910" end="00:31:28.040" style="s2">borsky Club crew but it&#39;s like I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.660" end="00:31:30.140" style="s2">could come up with an America with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.040" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">u.s. or Canadian parallel but there</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.140" end="00:31:35.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly one it&#39;s like if Ron Paul</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:36.650" style="s2">actually was super super powerful even</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.960" end="00:31:39.230" style="s2">though they are very different</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.650" end="00:31:43.059" style="s2">ideologies like if Ron Paul actually had</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.230" end="00:31:47.030" style="s2">if he could actually compan him like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.059" end="00:31:51.740" style="s2">command a military unit to to annex a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.030" end="00:31:52.400" style="s2">country like that would be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.740" end="00:31:55.580" style="s2">chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.400" end="00:32:02.900" style="s2">if Broncos in extinct countries that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.580" end="00:32:05.299" style="s2">would be pretty I I just think you would</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.900" end="00:32:10.730" style="s2">do his work for him he&#39;d be glad to come</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.299" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">on your show though and is I just think</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.730" end="00:32:16.520" style="s2">there are much more interesting I also</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.890" end="00:32:18.740" style="s2">think that even like the framing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.520" end="00:32:22.340" style="s2">wrong like there there are just more</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.740" end="00:32:26.510" style="s2">interesting conversations to be had like</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.340" end="00:32:31.030" style="s2">I think that fascism has a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.510" end="00:32:36.830" style="s2">interesting aesthetic but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.030" end="00:32:39.140" style="s2">politically really incoherent and so for</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.830" end="00:32:43.880" style="s2">people who are drawn to political</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:47.030" style="s2">ideologies for more aesthetic reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.880" end="00:32:49.910" style="s2">tends to have a seductive appeal that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.030" end="00:32:53.030" style="s2">being said I could also almost make the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.910" end="00:32:54.800" style="s2">argument that like you know fascism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.030" end="00:32:57.800" style="s2">anarchism are the two most coherent</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.800" end="00:33:05.060" style="s2">political ideologies dooms</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.800" end="00:33:07.670" style="s2">battle forever and so just that broad</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.060" end="00:33:11.090" style="s2">kind of concern there on your behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.670" end="00:33:13.370" style="s2">inviting us to the this platform and but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.090" end="00:33:15.290" style="s2">by the lake I&#39;m not leaving the stoah as</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.370" end="00:33:16.250" style="s2">is placed for broadcasting like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.290" end="00:33:16.910" style="s2">really give a shit about the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.250" end="00:33:18.530" style="s2">medium</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.910" end="00:33:20.900" style="s2">I got throw this on YouTube but all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.530" end="00:33:22.340" style="s2">comments are disabled I&#39;m happy to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.900" end="00:33:23.450" style="s2">it kind of a moment&#39;s notice but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.340" end="00:33:25.880" style="s2">more about building kind of community</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.450" end="00:33:28.280" style="s2">here I&#39;m more interested in with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.880" end="00:33:29.720" style="s2">people and we also have with these kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.280" end="00:33:31.460" style="s2">of sense-making Q&amp;A is we have like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.720" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">wisdom gym as well we&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.460" end="00:33:35.260" style="s2">sort of spiritual practices ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:38.600" style="s2">practices to kind of give us more</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.260" end="00:33:40.670" style="s2">sovereignty and help with communitas and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.600" end="00:33:44.630" style="s2">so the concern I&#39;m hearing is that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.670" end="00:33:46.130" style="s2">bring a guy in like Dugan who might say</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.630" end="00:33:48.050" style="s2">a lot of interesting things at</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.130" end="00:33:49.490" style="s2">attractive things on one level if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.050" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">can look at it from like a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.490" end="00:33:54.790" style="s2">meta abstract point of view but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:33:57.110" style="s2">you&#39;re blinded to all the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.790" end="00:33:59.030" style="s2">political machinations that he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.110" end="00:34:00.830" style="s2">the entry ISM then you&#39;re gonna get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.030" end="00:34:02.420" style="s2">wave of noise come in that could just</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.830" end="00:34:07.100" style="s2">disrupt your community and overtake it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.420" end="00:34:08.860" style="s2">from within and that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:10.520" style="s2">the concern so counter to that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.860" end="00:34:13.220" style="s2">Waterman&#39;s if you&#39;re playing your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.520" end="00:34:14.990" style="s2">game though and you you sort of court</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.220" end="00:34:16.820" style="s2">that noise in such a way but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.990" end="00:34:21.169" style="s2">transmute it into something more healthy</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.820" end="00:34:23.620" style="s2">more beautiful more wise yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.169" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">say it just like doesn&#39;t work like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.620" end="00:34:36.740" style="s2">in real life so one example is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:39.290" style="s2">green movements and so I have a paper</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.740" end="00:34:42.080" style="s2">coming out soon on like the history of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.290" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">eco fascist movements and all the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.080" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">back to like völkisch like Nazi green</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:49.820" style="s2">movements like environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:53.630" style="s2">movements to like intentional fascist</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.820" end="00:34:56.750" style="s2">co-optation of like environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.630" end="00:34:59.960" style="s2">movements both in the US and outside of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.750" end="00:35:02.570" style="s2">the US and so what happened in that case</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.960" end="00:35:04.010" style="s2">is like I&#39;ll use a I&#39;ll use a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.570" end="00:35:05.690" style="s2">concrete example there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.010" end="00:35:08.420" style="s2">organization called earth first which</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.690" end="00:35:11.749" style="s2">was engaging in like mostly nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.420" end="00:35:16.680" style="s2">direct action I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.749" end="00:35:21.479" style="s2">against extreme polluters in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.680" end="00:35:25.009" style="s2">they had this big tent policy mostly</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.479" end="00:35:27.749" style="s2">just being imposed to industrial society</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.009" end="00:35:31.259" style="s2">but like not having strong political</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.749" end="00:35:34.170" style="s2">they they identified as a political in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.259" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">sense so this gets into the the danger</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.170" end="00:35:42.749" style="s2">of a politicize &#39;im in a political world</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:44.819" style="s2">and what happened is there emerged this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.749" end="00:35:47.609" style="s2">can first there emerge this conservative</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.819" end="00:35:49.710" style="s2">wing of earth first but then there</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.609" end="00:35:54.539" style="s2">emerge like an explicitly fascist wing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.710" end="00:35:57.989" style="s2">of earth first and the damage that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.539" end="00:36:02.910" style="s2">did to green movements was so</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.989" end="00:36:07.859" style="s2">substantial that it took like many many</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.910" end="00:36:10.109" style="s2">years to like fully understand what had</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.859" end="00:36:12.420" style="s2">happened and then to like reverse it</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.109" end="00:36:15.059" style="s2">even though they in their own mind we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:18.390" style="s2">we&#39;re doing some some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.059" end="00:36:19.469" style="s2">conscious like interchange they like</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.390" end="00:36:21.239" style="s2">they knew at the time that they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.469" end="00:36:22.799" style="s2">dealing with these types of people but</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.239" end="00:36:25.319" style="s2">they thought like well we have this</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.799" end="00:36:32.460" style="s2">other goal and we can handle that or</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.319" end="00:36:35.460" style="s2">whatever and like I guess I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.460" end="00:36:38.910" style="s2">hard to explain what the experience is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.460" end="00:36:43.589" style="s2">like unless you&#39;ve experienced it but</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.910" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">like once the community realized what</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.589" end="00:36:48.809" style="s2">was happening which is that they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:50.609" style="s2">becoming a reactionary movement it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.809" end="00:36:54.089" style="s2">really hard to like kick all those</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.609" end="00:36:55.799" style="s2">people out and then rebuild their</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.089" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">charter eventually they became like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.799" end="00:37:00.690" style="s2">eventually realized that like anti</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:03.960" style="s2">racism was had to be a part of green</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.690" end="00:37:09.799" style="s2">movements and developed a like a more</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.960" end="00:37:13.050" style="s2">coherent ideological framework about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.799" end="00:37:15.250" style="s2">but it just</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.050" end="00:37:18.069" style="s2">such a waste of time and energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.250" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">basically like when they could have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.069" end="00:37:26.230" style="s2">doing their actual stated charter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:32.890" style="s2">in the Pacific Northwest there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.230" end="00:37:35.170" style="s2">lot of problems like that mm-hmm okay so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:37.480" style="s2">thank you for answering house let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.170" end="00:37:39.670" style="s2">pivot to the QA again if you have any</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.099" end="00:37:49.500" style="s2">know so we have Jack you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.579" end="00:37:58.869" style="s2">yeah hello hi it it seems that the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.740" end="00:38:01.589" style="s2">Internet can be a place where people can</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.869" end="00:38:06.369" style="s2">find genuine places of connection and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.589" end="00:38:08.099" style="s2">safety and where they wouldn&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.369" end="00:38:11.650" style="s2">in the physical world at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.099" end="00:38:13.750" style="s2">it can also there&#39;s groups that can find</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">connection that are that are complete</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.750" end="00:38:21.670" style="s2">hate groups right so I was wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">these these hate groups pollute these</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.670" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">groups that are trying to come together</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">for genuine connection in the contact</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:30.040" style="s2">and you can sort of become a positive</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.670" style="s2">feedback loop or one is reacting against</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.040" end="00:38:34.990" style="s2">the other or this hate group trolls a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.670" end="00:38:39.270" style="s2">genuine group and they turn them into</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:46.140" style="s2">something that is toxic like they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.270" end="00:38:48.220" style="s2">yeah so I work a lot in the or I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.140" end="00:38:52.089" style="s2">very connected and the peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.220" end="00:39:00.089" style="s2">space like p2p technologies such a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.089" end="00:39:02.470" style="s2">scuttlebutt shout out and there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.089" end="00:39:05.770" style="s2">serious concern in the scuttlebutt</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.470" end="00:39:07.630" style="s2">community because when you build these</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.770" end="00:39:09.640" style="s2">radically free technologies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.630" end="00:39:11.290" style="s2">inevitable that the worst type of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.640" end="00:39:15.700" style="s2">use them for the worst type of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.290" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">and like a trivial example of that would</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.700" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">be like you know maybe this is airing</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:26.500" style="s2">our dirty laundry a little bit but like</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:28.930" style="s2">if new users</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.930" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">saw was like white nationalism and child</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.830" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">abuse content then that would destroy</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:41.230" style="s2">the entire like incredibly powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:43.900" style="s2">beautiful project that they&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.230" end="00:39:48.460" style="s2">which has like this super super radical</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.900" end="00:39:50.590" style="s2">potential for for like well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.460" end="00:39:52.270" style="s2">communities I think the worst part is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.590" end="00:39:56.140" style="s2">that well-intentioned communities are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.270" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">the most vulnerable to like game</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.140" end="00:40:03.880" style="s2">theoretical like cheating dynamics like</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:09.070" style="s2">anyone who would abuse a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.880" end="00:40:11.610" style="s2">discourse anyone who like really</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.610" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2">kindness and in like these like very</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.300" end="00:40:20.440" style="s2">precious forms of connection that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.700" end="00:40:25.150" style="s2">describing that are kind of imbued in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.440" end="00:40:27.490" style="s2">the spirit of the Internet are the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.150" end="00:40:30.010" style="s2">are the most vulnerable and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.490" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">that&#39;s why I like left a lot of leftist</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.010" end="00:40:34.810" style="s2">movements like got caught so off guard</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.120" style="s2">for this thing because they&#39;re so like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.810" end="00:40:39.130" style="s2">ideological and they&#39;re so like we</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.120" end="00:40:40.990" style="s2">should be nice to each other that when</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.130" end="00:40:43.780" style="s2">someone came in who was like a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.990" end="00:40:47.100" style="s2">or whatever they were just like we</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.780" end="00:40:50.650" style="s2">should just love them harder and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.100" end="00:40:54.700" style="s2">you know doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t work against</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.650" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">like like a conscious or unconscious bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.700" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">actor there&#39;s like a weird tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:00.970" style="s2">Commons that can happen in the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if that answers your</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.970" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">question but yeah I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.050" end="00:41:20.170" style="s2">Manek you have a question yeah hi yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.980" end="00:41:22.810" style="s2">now only when you said when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.170" end="00:41:24.730" style="s2">mentioned that racism is incoherent I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.810" end="00:41:27.660" style="s2">was just thinking of you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.730" end="00:41:31.120" style="s2">links back to why we have these</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.660" end="00:41:33.370" style="s2">perceptions of the other why we</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.120" end="00:41:36.190" style="s2">subjugate people everything from your</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.370" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">one-on-one in relationship with anyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.190" end="00:41:40.300" style="s2">to society and I&#39;m really feeding a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.330" style="s2">of that right now as I watch the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.300" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">protests as I look at all the ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.330" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">people are responding it to it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:50.890" style="s2">just pondering is it cooking coherent</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:53.890" style="s2">because it feels incoherent because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.890" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">based on this whole fear of others and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.890" end="00:41:58.780" style="s2">of another and the control another has</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:01.450" style="s2">on you or your perceived you know your</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.780" end="00:42:03.550" style="s2">perception of power that someone else</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.450" end="00:42:05.380" style="s2">has over you in terms you know power and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.550" end="00:42:09.150" style="s2">control come in that so she&#39;s wondering</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.380" end="00:42:11.770" style="s2">do you think that&#39;s why it incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.150" end="00:42:17.380" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot of reasons that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.770" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s incoherent I I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.380" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">think the like psychological aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:28.690" style="s2">authoring someone that you describe is</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:31.330" style="s2">pretty central let me think of the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.690" end="00:42:33.100" style="s2">way to say this so there&#39;s that minimal</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.330" end="00:42:35.170" style="s2">definition of fascism that I used</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.100" end="00:42:37.810" style="s2">earlier but I think there&#39;s off like</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.170" end="00:42:39.330" style="s2">what we often associate is a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.810" end="00:42:44.170" style="s2">other characteristics like</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.330" end="00:42:47.980" style="s2">traditionalism methanol ISM scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.170" end="00:42:49.990" style="s2">of an other ultraviolence handful of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.980" end="00:42:53.890" style="s2">other things liberalism maybe would</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.990" end="00:42:55.510" style="s2">commonly be like a fellow traveler but</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.890" end="00:42:59.020" style="s2">when we talk about that scapegoating of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.510" end="00:43:03.370" style="s2">the other that you that you discussed I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.020" end="00:43:09.330" style="s2">think that that&#39;s kind of a turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.370" end="00:43:09.330" style="s2">point like</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.580" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s hot it&#39;s like fucking hard to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.470" end="00:43:19.250" style="s2">human I think like everybody understands</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:22.700" style="s2">that it like hurts to be human and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.250" end="00:43:25.340" style="s2">hurts to care and it hurts to be like</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.700" end="00:43:28.040" style="s2">constantly crushed by the world it just</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.340" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">is like painful and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.040" end="00:43:32.360" style="s2">beauty and we all continue living</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot to live for but</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.360" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just hard and when you promise when</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:41.960" style="s2">you promise something someone that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">pain could stop that that pain is real</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.960" end="00:43:48.370" style="s2">that pain could stop and it&#39;s the fault</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:48.370" style="s2">of our one true enemy</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.830" end="00:43:56.030" style="s2">I think that&#39;s appealing in a very very</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.580" end="00:43:59.540" style="s2">simplistic way obviously it&#39;s a lie but</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.030" end="00:44:03.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complete sham but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.540" end="00:44:07.190" style="s2">like there&#39;s an appeal you know to feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.800" end="00:44:10.220" style="s2">better in that way and I think the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.190" end="00:44:12.530" style="s2">part of it that I would get into is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.220" end="00:44:15.620" style="s2">the human desire for simple stories and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.530" end="00:44:18.530" style="s2">I think fascism is the simplest story in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.620" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">a complex world it&#39;s like if we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.530" end="00:44:24.310" style="s2">just have order and stricter hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:28.100" style="s2">and get rid of this our one true enemy</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.310" end="00:44:29.930" style="s2">which happens to be kind of a of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.100" end="00:44:33.350" style="s2">once your enemy ends up being kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.930" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">broad category that&#39;s game good that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.350" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">scapegoat keeps has to keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:41.360" style="s2">expanded because I can&#39;t just have one</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:44.500" style="s2">true enemy you know there&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.360" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">these information dynamic problems and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.500" end="00:44:48.290" style="s2">so like fascism isn&#39;t that good at</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:54.490" style="s2">keeping the trains running on time</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.290" end="00:44:59.660" style="s2">actually because because it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.490" end="00:45:01.790" style="s2">it it has it hasn&#39;t its events an overly</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.660" end="00:45:05.810" style="s2">simplistic view of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.790" end="00:45:09.350" style="s2">basically what I intended pond about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.810" end="00:45:15.310" style="s2">Italy just pond about Italy back in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.350" end="00:45:15.310" style="s2">body like keep it a trains running</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.859" end="00:45:24.089" style="s2">yes so I think that it&#39;s much so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.819" end="00:45:26.999" style="s2">like a safety in a simple story and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.089" end="00:45:30.150" style="s2">much scarier to grasp a complex story</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.999" end="00:45:33.690" style="s2">and that like all of our duty is to try</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.150" end="00:45:34.680" style="s2">to hold a complex story together even</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.690" end="00:45:37.349" style="s2">though it&#39;s scarier</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.680" end="00:45:41.309" style="s2">it&#39;s like scarier to love each other and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.349" end="00:45:43.529" style="s2">support each other in that way yeah No</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.309" end="00:45:45.839" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s uh that was many</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.529" end="00:45:48.450" style="s2">threads into those I mean they all come</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.839" end="00:45:50.130" style="s2">back to a very coherence because either</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.450" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to simplify and people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.130" end="00:45:53.910" style="s2">not that simple</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:56.099" style="s2">yeah the incoherence of just perception</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.910" end="00:45:59.069" style="s2">right and how we emotionally perceive</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.099" end="00:46:01.859" style="s2">and then makes constructs out of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.069" end="00:46:04.440" style="s2">Thanks thank you for that yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.859" end="00:46:06.479" style="s2">maybe one one more simple example that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.440" end="00:46:09.869" style="s2">maybe people with like look at maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.479" end="00:46:12.209" style="s2">using a simple example it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.869" end="00:46:14.759" style="s2">talked about eco fascism earlier and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.209" end="00:46:16.349" style="s2">now there&#39;s this like emerging movement</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.759" end="00:46:20.309" style="s2">that&#39;s like will solve climate change</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.349" end="00:46:22.949" style="s2">with fascism and like I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.309" end="00:46:26.670" style="s2">perfect example of a false promise like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.949" end="00:46:28.920" style="s2">ah yes a highly centralized system that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.670" end="00:46:31.289" style="s2">creates perverse incentives up and down</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.920" end="00:46:34.739" style="s2">a very rigid hierarchy of patronage</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.289" end="00:46:38.459" style="s2">networks certainly will be agile enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.739" end="00:46:41.309" style="s2">to support really diverse communities of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.459" end="00:46:43.309" style="s2">scientists that transcend racial ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.309" end="00:46:45.449" style="s2">religious and ideological political</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.309" end="00:46:47.299" style="s2">backgrounds in order to actually solve</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.449" end="00:46:50.130" style="s2">the problem at hand</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.299" end="00:46:52.549" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a really good example I</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.130" end="00:47:03.349" style="s2">think of like the false promise of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.549" end="00:47:06.449" style="s2">extreme hierarchy yeah thank you so duh</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.349" end="00:47:07.890" style="s2">Darrell do you have a question yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.449" end="00:47:09.479" style="s2">just I wonder if maybe it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.890" end="00:47:11.269" style="s2">naive but is there any way that entry</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.479" end="00:47:15.569" style="s2">ism could work the other way where</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.269" end="00:47:18.180" style="s2">people could have expand their horizons</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.569" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">and think about that and become less</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.180" end="00:47:22.619" style="s2">fascist because of people working to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:25.140" style="s2">work with them and and I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.619" end="00:47:26.999" style="s2">second question is what is scuttlebutt</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.140" end="00:47:30.360" style="s2">community talking about doing about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.999" end="00:47:33.900" style="s2">potential vulnerability of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.360" end="00:47:35.240" style="s2">kind of naive left perspective about Oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.900" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">will just love them to death like is</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.240" end="00:47:42.920" style="s2">like how do we protect ourselves yet</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.430" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">inviting him to Shabbat I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.590" end="00:50:14.430" style="s2">these are the kind of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:16.320" style="s2">liberal dreams are made of and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.430" end="00:50:20.390" style="s2">generally doesn&#39;t work but when it does</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.320" end="00:50:20.390" style="s2">work it&#39;s like can be pretty powerful</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:27.450" style="s2">there&#39;s people pursuing all kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.300" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">careful it&#39;s just important to consider</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.430" end="00:50:44.280" style="s2">how that work gets contained there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:46.230" style="s2">kind of like a counterintelligence angle</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.280" end="00:50:48.540" style="s2">to it like if you&#39;re just actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.230" end="00:50:51.030" style="s2">like some sort of weird like information</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.540" end="00:50:53.760" style="s2">warfare against fascism versus if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.810" end="00:51:01.260" style="s2">a lot of complicated things there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.790" end="00:51:02.850" style="s2">called light upon light and there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.260" end="00:51:04.950" style="s2">controversy about whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.850" end="00:51:08.220" style="s2">actually just platforming white</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.950" end="00:51:11.250" style="s2">nationalists because they like said this</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.220" end="00:51:13.230" style="s2">guy Matthew haibach was reformed when</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.250" end="00:51:16.020" style="s2">actually he has basically the exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.230" end="00:51:19.110" style="s2">same politics that he had before which</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.020" end="00:51:21.840" style="s2">is that he&#39;s in not school he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.110" end="00:51:25.740" style="s2">like white ethno state he&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.840" end="00:51:27.270" style="s2">street brawling and so then they gave</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.740" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">him a huge platform to talk about not</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.270" end="00:51:33.570" style="s2">spoil politics you know but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.990" style="s2">lot of really cool D radicalization</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.570" end="00:51:42.600" style="s2">organizations to like exit in Germany</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.990" end="00:51:46.020" style="s2">and yeah as far as scuttlebutt I have a</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.130" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">experience and so they&#39;re engaging in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.180" end="00:52:13.880" style="s2">ton of strategies at once but</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:16.509" style="s2">peer-to-peer technology is like the</p>
