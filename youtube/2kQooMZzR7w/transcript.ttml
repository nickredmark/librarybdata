<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:45.189" style="s2">that was part of the larger critique</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.390" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">than that accommodation and those so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.880" end="00:02:33.490" style="s2">sacred is doing that but I also propose</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:35.650" style="s2">that we needed to look at this more</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.490" end="00:02:40.030" style="s2">deeply we needed to look at how the</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.030" end="00:02:47.020" style="s2">problems so that took us into opening up</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:48.550" style="s2">and becoming a little bit more analytic</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.020" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">about the meaning crisis there&#39;s two</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:16.710" style="s2">will give us a way of articulating a</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.870" end="00:06:21.670" style="s2">meaning-making and of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.050" end="00:06:23.110" style="s2">linchpin of that argument is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.670" end="00:06:25.540" style="s2">that at the core of the meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.110" end="00:06:27.370" style="s2">is relevance realization and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.540" end="00:06:30.730" style="s2">realization B can be given a</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.730" end="00:06:38.970" style="s2">hopefully still does full justice to the</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.060" end="00:06:45.990" style="s2">but I want to concentrate as we began</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.100" end="00:06:48.970" style="s2">last time on the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.990" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">because ultimately that&#39;s the final</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.970" end="00:06:59.130" style="s2">thing if I come up with a historical</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.500" end="00:07:03.010" style="s2">response and it does not actually afford</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.130" end="00:07:08.830" style="s2">the addressing of the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.010" end="00:07:11.260" style="s2">helps people to ameliorate and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.830" end="00:07:14.170" style="s2">alleviate the perennial problems then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.260" end="00:07:16.390" style="s2">this project has failed so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.170" end="00:07:17.890" style="s2">start discussing the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.390" end="00:07:20.350" style="s2">and developing this thesis more</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.890" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">extensively that the very machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.350" end="00:07:24.610" style="s2">makes us adaptive makes us susceptible</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:34.390" style="s2">self-destructive patterns of behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:37.780" style="s2">we talked about looking at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.390" end="00:07:41.010" style="s2">core features of religio right so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.780" end="00:07:41.010" style="s2">got functional features</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.690" end="00:07:49.970" style="s2">all right and here we have of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.350" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">self-organization and I tried to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.970" end="00:07:55.970" style="s2">that very explicitly it&#39;s not just vague</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.650" end="00:08:40.310" style="s2">second-order thinking we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.729" end="00:08:43.180" style="s2">the structural this has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.310" end="00:08:48.710" style="s2">components of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.180" end="00:08:55.450" style="s2">relationship the ways in which self is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.710" end="00:09:01.690" style="s2">connected to the world self is connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.450" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">to self and self is connected to others</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.690" end="00:09:10.280" style="s2">right and then we looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">developmental and I sort of laid left</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.280" end="00:09:13.220" style="s2">out as a placeholder because I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">wanted to give a quick overview last</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.220" end="00:09:18.110" style="s2">time but I wanted to go in and draw this</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">together because what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.110" end="00:09:23.290" style="s2">about throughout the last few lectures</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:26.030" style="s2">is the idea that your cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.290" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">inherently developmental it functions by</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.030" end="00:09:31.300" style="s2">developing it develops by functioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:34.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a right so because it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.300" end="00:09:41.130" style="s2">self-organizing it develops right by</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.310" end="00:09:44.010" style="s2">functioning it functions</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.130" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">by developing and this is qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.010" end="00:09:51.450" style="s2">development right what I mean is you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:54.540" style="s2">the capacity for self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.450" end="00:09:56.820" style="s2">there&#39;s not only an increase in what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.540" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">know but an increase in the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:02.630" style="s2">things you can know the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:10.680" style="s2">you can do right and this is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.630" end="00:10:16.530" style="s2">some kind of process of optimization so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.680" end="00:10:21.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a developmental trajectory and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.530" end="00:10:23.180" style="s2">then what you can see right is some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.330" end="00:10:27.480" style="s2">the problems we&#39;ve already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.180" end="00:10:32.670" style="s2">the parasitic processing in the notes</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.480" end="00:10:35.940" style="s2">for this lecture I will put references</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.670" end="00:10:39.060" style="s2">to the previous lectures in which I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.940" end="00:10:42.210" style="s2">talked about these in detail so if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.060" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">in order to avoid useless repetition you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.210" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">can go back and look at the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">all right but this is if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:51.380" style="s2">you there&#39;s a bad event and it spirals</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:53.850" style="s2">off and it gets as very complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.380" end="00:10:55.710" style="s2">self-organizing system that takes on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.850" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">life of its own becomes very compelling</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.710" end="00:11:01.740" style="s2">very adaptively resistant to our</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">attempts at intervention etc okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.740" end="00:11:08.340" style="s2">this is modal confusion this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">right Fromm but very much you can also</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.340" end="00:11:11.910" style="s2">see it being addressed by the Stoics you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:14.760" style="s2">can see it being addressed by Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.910" end="00:11:16.080" style="s2">as Batchelor argues this is to get into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.760" end="00:11:19.050" style="s2">confusion between the having and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.080" end="00:11:22.250" style="s2">being modes the kind of AI that you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.050" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">the are you in an ayat&#39; i thou etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.250" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">self-reflection last time we talked</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:32.310" style="s2">about this this is the reflectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.980" end="00:11:34.110" style="s2">gap this comes from the fact that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.310" end="00:11:38.490" style="s2">we can do is we can step back and look</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.110" end="00:11:42.440" style="s2">at our own processing and this affords</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.490" end="00:11:46.250" style="s2">us this gap affords us regaining our</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.440" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">agency from the chaos of being the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.250" end="00:11:52.690" style="s2">impulsive wantin but when we open up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">reflectiveness gap too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.690" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">we got also a loss of a agency we get</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">the tragedy of Hamlet and of course some</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:00.760" style="s2">middling position is not the answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.260" style="s2">there because at times you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.760" end="00:12:04.950" style="s2">highly reflective at times you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.260" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">be highly immersed how do we answer that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.950" end="00:12:13.180" style="s2">the problem here right with the self</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">world relationship is absurdity as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.180" end="00:12:17.950" style="s2">said this is the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:20.620" style="s2">relationship and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.950" end="00:12:23.620" style="s2">absurdity here and made clear that all</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.620" end="00:12:24.970" style="s2">of the arguments for absurdity like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.620" end="00:12:27.220" style="s2">happens a million years from now it</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.970" end="00:12:30.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter I&#39;m is so small I will</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:33.850" style="s2">die none of these things actually are</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.060" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">arguments that can legitimately lead to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.850" end="00:12:37.690" style="s2">a conclusion of absurdity because there</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">are in many ways and this was Nagle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.690" end="00:12:41.400" style="s2">point there they&#39;re just bad arguments</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:43.480" style="s2">they&#39;re fallacious arguments now</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.400" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">dismissing the arguments is not to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.480" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">dismiss the person who makes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:48.310" style="s2">argument I&#39;d hope I made that clear last</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:50.770" style="s2">time if not I&#39;m trying to do that now</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.310" end="00:12:52.780" style="s2">because people are trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.770" end="00:12:55.240" style="s2">with these pseudo arguments something</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.780" end="00:12:57.550" style="s2">real that is happening to them something</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.240" end="00:13:00.370" style="s2">that is very important so the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.550" end="00:13:03.100" style="s2">are after the fact expressions rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.370" end="00:13:05.140" style="s2">than the generators and the the main</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.100" end="00:13:08.350" style="s2">thing here and this of course goes into</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.140" end="00:13:11.560" style="s2">right you can see how all of this is our</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.350" end="00:13:14.140" style="s2">prospective all participatory ways of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.560" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">being ways of knowing okay but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.140" end="00:13:21.640" style="s2">here is a clash of perspectives all</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">right it&#39;s a class of perspectives when</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.640" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">we did the example of Tom who&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:29.350" style="s2">Susan and how in humor that clash of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:32.020" style="s2">perspectives can be resolved usually by</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.350" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">playing like equivocating between terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.020" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">or meanings or getting some people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:38.350" style="s2">make a connection they hadn&#39;t made</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">before but an absurdity and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.350" end="00:13:43.570" style="s2">there&#39;s like I think there&#39;s a overlap</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:45.910" style="s2">like this right where you have humor as</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.570" end="00:13:48.250" style="s2">a resolvable clash of prospective</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.910" end="00:13:52.750" style="s2">perspectives and then you have absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.250" end="00:13:54.490" style="s2">here right and then there&#39;s an overlap</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.750" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">zone and like I said there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.490" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">humor</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.560" style="s2">my prototypical example tells my age</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:01.840" style="s2">when I was growing up is the humor of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.560" end="00:14:03.970" style="s2">Monty Python in which right you get a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.840" end="00:14:07.260" style="s2">lot of absurdity but then it you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.970" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">what becomes irresolvable</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.260" end="00:14:13.270" style="s2">it&#39;s undermining religio in some way</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:21.250" style="s2">undermining your your agency in some way</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.270" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of pure absurdity myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.250" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">with self this goes back to what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:30.279" style="s2">talked about with Tillich right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">anxiety inner conflict and what we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:36.610" style="s2">here right is to again think about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:39.910" style="s2">ways in which this is connected to write</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.610" end="00:14:43.089" style="s2">a self-deception because the inner</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.910" end="00:14:44.770" style="s2">conflict remember Plato often skews your</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.089" end="00:14:47.290" style="s2">salience landscape and makes you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.770" end="00:14:49.240" style="s2">susceptible to pull bullshitting I&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.240" end="00:14:55.690" style="s2">this over all right of course this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.020" end="00:14:57.130" style="s2">alienation this is our inability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.690" end="00:14:59.830" style="s2">connect to other people something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.130" end="00:15:02.440" style="s2">is often exacerbated through social</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.440" end="00:15:08.020" style="s2">problems and self deceptive behavior can</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.750" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">be magnified in social media so we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.020" end="00:15:11.860" style="s2">be modally confused and think by having</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">a lot of connections we&#39;re overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.860" end="00:15:18.089" style="s2">our alienation and loneliness but of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:21.910" style="s2">course that&#39;s not the case we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.089" end="00:15:25.210" style="s2">exacerbate the social media by falling</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.910" end="00:15:29.280" style="s2">into a sort of pretend pretended</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.210" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">narrative and things like that okay here</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.280" end="00:15:37.740" style="s2">we talked about like existential inertia</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:40.870" style="s2">this is when you need to move between</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.820" end="00:15:47.260" style="s2">to talk a lot more about the work of</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.260" end="00:15:52.209" style="s2">and with aspiration but the point here</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:55.990" style="s2">and going back again to the seminal work</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.209" end="00:15:59.650" style="s2">of la paul but this is basically a need</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.990" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">for an agog a how do i and agog a my way</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">worldview and then of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:12.060" style="s2">existential ignorance a point made</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">salient by la paul and also picked up by</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.060" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">agnes coloured in her book on aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:19.840" style="s2">that right we can&#39;t sort of reason our</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.290" end="00:19:13.240" style="s2">again I&#39;m trying to get a balance</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">but okay I&#39;m gonna go through these each</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.370" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">one first I&#39;m just gonna sort of name so</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:36.580" style="s2">you can get an overall schematic and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">then I&#39;ll erase the board and I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.580" end="00:19:42.790" style="s2">about each one in greater detail okay so</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.290" style="s2">be patient please I&#39;m asking for your</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.790" end="00:19:46.840" style="s2">patience I&#39;m just going to give some</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.290" end="00:19:49.000" style="s2">indications about how we address each</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.840" end="00:19:50.920" style="s2">one of these schematically so you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.000" end="00:19:52.780" style="s2">see on the board and then I&#39;ll step back</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.920" end="00:19:55.390" style="s2">and go through each one in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.780" end="00:19:58.360" style="s2">and then how they&#39;re integrated together</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.390" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">and what&#39;s also missing from this in an</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.360" end="00:20:03.060" style="s2">important sense so what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:06.310" style="s2">propose here is the way you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.060" end="00:20:08.050" style="s2">parasitic processing is and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.310" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">this is number one in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.050" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">schematically it&#39;s overarching you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">heard me talk about it before with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.460" end="00:20:18.430" style="s2">idea of an ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:19.810" style="s2">ecology of psycho technology right what</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.430" end="00:20:23.350" style="s2">you want to do is you want to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.810" end="00:20:26.170" style="s2">a counter active dynamical system see</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.350" end="00:20:28.180" style="s2">parasitic processing is a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.170" end="00:20:29.770" style="s2">dynamical system and if you try and do</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.180" end="00:20:32.350" style="s2">one-shot interventions it just</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.770" end="00:20:34.840" style="s2">reconfigures itself what you need is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.350" end="00:20:36.730" style="s2">cultivate a camp that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.840" end="00:20:39.690" style="s2">internalized can&#39;t just be something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.730" end="00:20:42.100" style="s2">think about it can&#39;t just be some right</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.690" end="00:20:45.670" style="s2">ideological structure it has to actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">be an active dynamical system in you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.670" end="00:20:48.460" style="s2">so what you&#39;re gonna do and again I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">come back to this in more detail you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.460" end="00:20:53.190" style="s2">gonna try and cultivate a counteractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:57.250" style="s2">dynamical system because that is how you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.190" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">will be able to respond to the dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:02.409" style="s2">systems of parasitic processing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">propose to you that a prototypical by no</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.409" end="00:21:08.730" style="s2">means exclusive so that&#39;s how I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:11.370" style="s2">it but a prototypical example of this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.730" end="00:21:14.889" style="s2">the cultivation of the Eightfold Path</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.370" end="00:21:16.840" style="s2">and Buddhism which is very very</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.889" end="00:21:19.179" style="s2">perspicacious Li represented by an</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.840" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">eighth spoked wheel the integration it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.179" end="00:21:25.769" style="s2">revolves it involves etc so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:29.529" style="s2">looking for here is a counter active</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.769" end="00:21:32.289" style="s2">dynamical system ok modal confusion we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.529" end="00:21:36.429" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked about this and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.289" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">is sati practices that are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.429" end="00:21:44.830" style="s2">invoke a deep remembrance of the being</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:47.830" style="s2">mode ok the reflectiveness gap you need</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.830" end="00:21:50.679" style="s2">the combination the integration the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.830" end="00:21:52.659" style="s2">dynamic integration not just a settled</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.679" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">median point you need a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.659" end="00:21:58.269" style="s2">integration of immersion and creative</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:59.710" style="s2">flexibility we know a state that does</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.269" end="00:22:01.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.710" end="00:22:04.659" style="s2">but that&#39;s the flow statement you need</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.480" end="00:22:08.830" style="s2">to be cultivating the flow state in in</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.659" end="00:22:14.049" style="s2">important ways ok the clash of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.830" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">perspectives this is going to take again</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.049" end="00:22:17.340" style="s2">so this what I put on the board right</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:20.019" style="s2">now initially it&#39;s gonna seem like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.340" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">so again give me some time I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.019" end="00:22:25.720" style="s2">gonna put it on here this is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:29.230" style="s2">Spinoza in the West called C&amp;C Intuit</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.720" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">Eva or what in Buddhism in the East</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.230" end="00:22:35.470" style="s2">refers to is Praja this is a state right</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:38.289" style="s2">in which you get the deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.470" end="00:22:41.909" style="s2">interpenetration of the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.289" end="00:22:45.639" style="s2">right so I&#39;m just gonna put it up here</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.909" end="00:22:49.350" style="s2">and you like wow what does that mean how</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.639" end="00:22:51.970" style="s2">you do that scans here and to ateva</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.350" end="00:22:53.980" style="s2">proj nut but if you remember just to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.970" end="00:22:56.590" style="s2">foreshadow it right we talked about I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.980" end="00:22:59.380" style="s2">can scale down I can scale up and then I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.590" end="00:23:00.850" style="s2">can get the state of non-duality that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.380" end="00:23:04.350" style="s2">simultaneously scaling up and scaling</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.850" end="00:23:07.210" style="s2">down and that actually alleviates the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.350" end="00:23:08.830" style="s2">clash of perspectives so we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.210" end="00:23:12.050" style="s2">to this ok</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.830" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">so anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.050" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">is inner dialogue so this is to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:21.230" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:22.820" style="s2">the idea of internalizing the sage right</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.230" end="00:23:24.590" style="s2">as the child is to the adult the idle</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.820" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">distance stage I want to like the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.590" end="00:23:28.970" style="s2">it&#39;s so an exemplary example of this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.040" style="s2">that you know the Christians it&#39;s not I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.970" end="00:23:33.020" style="s2">who live but Christ who lives in me or</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.040" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">the Buddhists you have to realize your</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.020" end="00:23:38.180" style="s2">Buddha nature or the Stoics I have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:40.700" style="s2">internalize Socrates and again if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.180" end="00:23:43.610" style="s2">turn these into ideas to believed rather</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:46.790" style="s2">than you know practices that are have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.610" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">actually been internalized and our art</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.790" end="00:23:52.940" style="s2">are integrated into your the development</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:53.720" style="s2">of your identity then you&#39;re not hearing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.940" end="00:23:57.020" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.720" end="00:23:59.870" style="s2">okay so alienation I haven&#39;t talked as</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.020" end="00:24:02.600" style="s2">much about this but I&#39;m going to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.870" end="00:24:04.430" style="s2">back to this more this is to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.600" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">what Turner and other people call</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.430" end="00:24:11.210" style="s2">communitas this is the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:13.610" style="s2">connectedness to other and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.210" end="00:24:15.530" style="s2">is to try and recover what we had in</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.610" end="00:24:17.480" style="s2">platonic dialogue and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.530" end="00:24:19.640" style="s2">right now is a whole movement called</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.480" end="00:24:21.410" style="s2">authentic discourse I&#39;m going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.640" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">lot more about that the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.410" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">discourse movement right authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:33.020" style="s2">discourse movement but we just need</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:34.990" style="s2">authentic discourse here something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.020" end="00:24:37.820" style="s2">what we had in platonic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.990" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">something like therapy sort of both</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.820" end="00:24:42.250" style="s2">beyond I&#39;ll come back to that because</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:45.800" style="s2">this is a primary way of doing this I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.250" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">gave you an extended argument for how</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.800" end="00:24:54.340" style="s2">you respond to existential entrapment</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">and of course this is gnosis and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.340" end="00:24:57.890" style="s2">this gnosis is going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">connection to higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.890" end="00:25:07.640" style="s2">consciousness there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.850" end="00:25:11.060" style="s2">missing right and what&#39;s missing is we</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.640" end="00:25:12.590" style="s2">need of course a an overall framing of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.060" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">these things that they the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.590" end="00:25:17.060" style="s2">pursuing all of these and the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:19.130" style="s2">trying to integrate them together right</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.060" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll put I&#39;ll put it here because I ran</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.130" end="00:25:24.830" style="s2">out of board on that side all of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">has to be within a wisdom framing</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.830" end="00:25:30.270" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk more explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:33.090" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna devote quite a bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.270" end="00:25:37.620" style="s2">to try and get at what can we now think</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.090" end="00:25:39.390" style="s2">about wisdom given all the current work</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.620" end="00:25:42.650" style="s2">within psychology and cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:44.970" style="s2">and even neuroscience on wisdom right</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.650" end="00:25:50.250" style="s2">because if throughout all of this we</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.970" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">have to have a we have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.250" end="00:25:56.940" style="s2">cognitive style in which the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">amelioration of self-deception and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.940" end="00:26:03.750" style="s2">affordance of self optimization are</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:06.539" style="s2">paramount okay so I want to go through</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.750" end="00:26:08.100" style="s2">each one of these in more detail this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.539" end="00:26:11.220" style="s2">the overarching structure and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.100" end="00:26:13.350" style="s2">trying to bring it together what is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.220" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing to you and seeing then</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.350" end="00:26:18.870" style="s2">here&#39;s where my concern about hubris is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:20.909" style="s2">here although I think there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.870" end="00:26:23.789" style="s2">bit of point I&#39;m making I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.909" end="00:26:27.539" style="s2">argue for a way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.789" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">reverse-engineer enlightenment instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.539" end="00:26:34.760" style="s2">of keeping enlightenment as an obscure</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:39.390" style="s2">state surrounded by mystique and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.760" end="00:26:43.320" style="s2">nostalgia we need an account that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.390" end="00:26:45.600" style="s2">recognizes what that mystique pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.320" end="00:26:54.600" style="s2">but exaggerated which is the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:27:03.900" style="s2">of enlightenment but ultimately if we</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.600" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">have a kind of being a ecology of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.900" end="00:27:09.059" style="s2">technology that reliably and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">systematically individually and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.059" end="00:27:16.289" style="s2">collectively allows us to address the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:17.669" style="s2">perennial problems I&#39;m gonna propose to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.289" end="00:27:20.340" style="s2">you that that&#39;s what we should call</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.669" end="00:27:22.289" style="s2">enlightenment if enlightenment is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.340" end="00:27:25.909" style="s2">something above and beyond that then I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.289" end="00:27:31.799" style="s2">don&#39;t know what what its value is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.909" end="00:27:35.370" style="s2">and if enlightenment is not directed</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.799" end="00:27:39.240" style="s2">towards this I would say it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.370" end="00:27:42.990" style="s2">not something of value so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.240" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">propose to you that insofar as we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.990" end="00:27:47.730" style="s2">give using the theoretical tools we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:51.720" style="s2">cultivated together relevance</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.730" end="00:27:53.129" style="s2">realization etc insofar as we can need</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.720" end="00:27:55.289" style="s2">the work we&#39;ve done on mindfulness the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.129" end="00:27:59.789" style="s2">work we&#39;ve done on flow right all of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.289" end="00:28:04.039" style="s2">in so far as we can give an account of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.789" end="00:28:06.509" style="s2">this in terms that are all ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.039" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">naturalistic they can be subject to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.509" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">scientific investigation we will have</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:16.980" style="s2">and and this is is this the final sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.419" style="s2">of challenge to the division given to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.980" end="00:28:21.899" style="s2">on the Enlightenment we will have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.419" end="00:28:30.169" style="s2">scientific theory of enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.899" end="00:28:30.169" style="s2">what it can mean for us all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.540" end="00:28:46.390" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about some of these I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.800" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">talk about it more at length because</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.390" end="00:28:50.860" style="s2">they&#39;re more novel others I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:53.830" style="s2">about more briefly because there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.860" end="00:28:56.560" style="s2">extended discussion of them so again</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.830" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">let&#39;s start with this notion of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.560" end="00:29:03.310" style="s2">with parasitic processing which is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:06.250" style="s2">overarching thing and the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.310" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">as I said to cultivate a set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.250" end="00:29:10.660" style="s2">practices and that&#39;s what you have with</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:12.970" style="s2">something like the Eightfold Path where</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.660" end="00:29:15.310" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to remember all of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.970" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">you know right aspiration right</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.310" end="00:29:18.760" style="s2">mindfulness right concentration etc</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:20.950" style="s2">remember that the right is not moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.760" end="00:29:23.560" style="s2">righteousness the right is right</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.950" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">handedness it&#39;s dexterity and now to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.560" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">language that we&#39;ve developed it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:31.240" style="s2">fitness it&#39;s an optimal fitness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:33.250" style="s2">enhanced relevance realization within</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.240" end="00:29:36.760" style="s2">each one of these and what you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.250" end="00:29:39.130" style="s2">right is a set of practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.760" end="00:29:42.220" style="s2">interdependent with each other mutually</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.130" end="00:29:46.690" style="s2">supporting and self rolling becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.220" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">self rolling wheel and if I have a set</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.690" end="00:29:51.640" style="s2">of practices that can take on a life of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.640" end="00:29:56.050" style="s2">and you have the metaphors right in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:30:00.270" style="s2">Buddhism of you like where you enter the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.050" end="00:30:03.280" style="s2">stream it takes on a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.270" end="00:30:04.570" style="s2">initially what I&#39;m doing right is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:06.280" style="s2">cultivating this practice and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.570" end="00:30:08.890" style="s2">practice in this practice and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.280" end="00:30:12.430" style="s2">sort of set but then they start to write</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.890" end="00:30:14.110" style="s2">it implicitly interact reinforce the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.430" end="00:30:16.900" style="s2">develop and it starts to become a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.110" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">counter active dynamical system in me</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.900" end="00:30:22.120" style="s2">the the Buddha told a famous parable</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:25.000" style="s2">about how to understand this he talks</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.120" end="00:30:26.530" style="s2">about the goldsmith and the gold is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.000" end="00:30:28.540" style="s2">something inherently valuable and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.530" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">should think of your mind as something</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.540" end="00:30:34.450" style="s2">inherently valuable right and he says</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:36.310" style="s2">okay so take a look at the goldsmith the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.450" end="00:30:38.230" style="s2">goldsmith just looks at the gold no</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.310" end="00:30:40.150" style="s2">change is wrought so if you&#39;re just sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.230" end="00:30:43.990" style="s2">of doing meditation and reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.150" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">nothing happens right the goldsmith has</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.990" end="00:30:48.130" style="s2">to heat up the gold right there&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.980" style="s2">this right effort the energy put in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.130" end="00:30:53.080" style="s2">maybe something like flow right but if</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.980" end="00:31:59.040" style="s2">this fluid ecology of looking of heating</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.270" end="00:32:02.140" style="s2">and of shaping then the gold becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.040" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">well shaped and it becomes as he says we</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.140" end="00:32:07.000" style="s2">ugly you can wield it very well you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:10.060" style="s2">it fits your hand and extends your</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.000" end="00:32:10.510" style="s2">capacity so well so what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.060" end="00:32:14.260" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.510" end="00:32:17.020" style="s2">right is a strong recommendation for</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.260" end="00:32:19.270" style="s2">looking at this as you know cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.020" end="00:32:22.270" style="s2">an ecology of practices getting sets of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.270" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">practices sets of psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.270" end="00:32:27.420" style="s2">that have complimentary relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:31.240" style="s2">each other organizing them together</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.420" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">right and we do this all the time we we</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.240" end="00:32:37.000" style="s2">we we Const we Kate constellations of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">lower order skills and techniques to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.000" end="00:32:41.640" style="s2">build higher order skills and techniques</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:44.500" style="s2">but we build it as a dynamical system a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.640" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">counteractive dynamical system that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.500" end="00:32:50.950" style="s2">operate in many ways on many levels of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:54.070" style="s2">our cognition and our consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:57.040" style="s2">our being so the way to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.070" end="00:33:01.800" style="s2">parasitic processing is to cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.040" end="00:33:01.800" style="s2">counter active dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.700" end="00:33:09.490" style="s2">and this is why this is an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">thing so modal confusion we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.490" end="00:33:14.620" style="s2">talked about this we&#39;ve already talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:17.290" style="s2">about the way in which mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.620" end="00:33:19.059" style="s2">practices and other practices like they</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.290" end="00:33:21.850" style="s2">can be drawn from stoicism like the view</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.059" end="00:33:25.090" style="s2">from the Bob or objective seeing can</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.850" end="00:33:28.270" style="s2">help us to remember sati the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.090" end="00:33:30.670" style="s2">again not as an idea not as a belief but</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.270" end="00:33:34.690" style="s2">as an existential mode that we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.670" end="00:33:38.130" style="s2">reliably reactivate and re-enter into in</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.690" end="00:33:46.090" style="s2">a viable and enriching manner</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.130" end="00:33:48.400" style="s2">okay the reflectiveness gap and flow so</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.090" end="00:33:51.010" style="s2">if I were to just speak this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.400" end="00:33:55.830" style="s2">impulsively wantonly just gah it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.010" end="00:33:59.309" style="s2">become chaotic right it&#39;ll tend to right</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.830" end="00:34:01.720" style="s2">probably fall into self-contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.309" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">they will be confused and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.720" end="00:34:07.450" style="s2">confusing but if I&#39;m constantly stepping</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:09.550" style="s2">back and reflecting on what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.450" end="00:34:18.820" style="s2">and engaging in self-criticism and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.550" end="00:34:24.790" style="s2">thinking I also I&#39;ll choke right so what</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.820" end="00:34:29.260" style="s2">do I do well I try to get into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.790" end="00:34:32.860" style="s2">state because the flow state is a state</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.260" end="00:34:34.360" style="s2">in which I am both and velman by the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.860" end="00:34:38.440" style="s2">argues for something very similar he</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.360" end="00:34:41.379" style="s2">proposes Taoism and Taoism as a solution</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.440" end="00:34:43.300" style="s2">to the reflectiveness gap and of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.379" end="00:34:47.500" style="s2">as I&#39;ve argued Taoism is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.300" end="00:34:49.990" style="s2">religion of flow in many ways the yin</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.500" end="00:34:54.040" style="s2">and yang the out in the end right there</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.990" end="00:34:58.930" style="s2">making frame and breaking frame etc so</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.040" end="00:35:01.840" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is set up the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.930" end="00:35:03.670" style="s2">practices that will afford flow set up</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.840" end="00:35:06.280" style="s2">the conditions that will afford flow and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.670" end="00:35:08.650" style="s2">remember we talked about the right kinds</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.280" end="00:35:10.080" style="s2">of conditions and also and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.650" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to go back to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.080" end="00:35:13.319" style="s2">wisely cultivate your flow where and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:15.479" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.319" end="00:35:17.190" style="s2">and in what domains are you learning to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.479" end="00:35:19.650" style="s2">flow so I&#39;m trying to get into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.190" end="00:35:23.059" style="s2">state here that will keep me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.650" end="00:35:27.569" style="s2">immersed and engaged with the material</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.059" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">but also make me hopefully very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.569" end="00:35:32.940" style="s2">flexible and capable when needed I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:33.809" style="s2">mean to be self congratulatory but you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:37.559" style="s2">know where it&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.809" end="00:35:39.299" style="s2">hopefully insightful that there is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.559" end="00:35:43.369" style="s2">this is not just mechanical that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.299" end="00:35:47.699" style="s2">an element of sort of well a flow to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.369" end="00:35:54.390" style="s2">almost like jazz jazz with concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.699" end="00:35:58.349" style="s2">jazz with argumentation okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.390" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">come back to absurdity and come back to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.349" end="00:36:04.410" style="s2">Praja talk about this again we did talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:09.989" style="s2">about this before but I want to remind</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.410" end="00:36:13.289" style="s2">you of it and that you are very capable</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.989" end="00:36:15.239" style="s2">of this because your cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.289" end="00:36:17.880" style="s2">capable because of the way attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.239" end="00:36:19.739" style="s2">works because attention we put it up</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.880" end="00:36:20.969" style="s2">multiple times right the cat and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.739" end="00:36:22.799" style="s2">everything your attention is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.969" end="00:36:25.400" style="s2">simultaneously bottom up from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.799" end="00:36:29.910" style="s2">features and top down from the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:32.099" style="s2">all right and your attention write it</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.910" end="00:36:35.729" style="s2">right the way you are related to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.099" end="00:36:37.499" style="s2">world is one in which the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.729" end="00:36:40.019" style="s2">can be co-creating this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.499" end="00:36:41.969" style="s2">something that Spinoza talks quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.019" end="00:36:44.670" style="s2">about in the ethics the how your</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.969" end="00:36:51.449" style="s2">experience is co-created by the by by</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.670" end="00:36:54.319" style="s2">the body and by the world so if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.449" end="00:36:59.339" style="s2">remember Spinoza talks about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.319" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">right when you&#39;re reading an argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.339" end="00:37:06.420" style="s2">and his whole book the ethics is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:09.089" style="s2">attempt to bring back blessedness and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:11.819" style="s2">sense of I would argue sacredness within</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.089" end="00:37:13.109" style="s2">a cartesian scientific worldview that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.819" end="00:37:15.180" style="s2">what&#39;s called the ethics</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.109" end="00:37:18.509" style="s2">it means ethics in the older sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.180" end="00:37:20.430" style="s2">becoming the best person leading the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.509" end="00:37:22.950" style="s2">best kind of life not just doing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.430" end="00:37:25.859" style="s2">morally correct thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:28.799" style="s2">but Spinoza talks about this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.859" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">knowing and and but I realized when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.799" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">was reading the ethic while studying the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:33.540" style="s2">ethic so you have to almost do lectio</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">Divina with the ethics you have to read</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.540" end="00:37:38.250" style="s2">it you have to really let it soak in do</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.990" style="s2">you have to try and get that worldview a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.250" end="00:37:43.950" style="s2">tuner here just what&#39;s it like to see</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.990" end="00:37:45.950" style="s2">the world as Spinoza did so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:49.049" style="s2">sort of study and practice the ethics</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.950" end="00:37:51.150" style="s2">viously it&#39;s an extended period and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.049" end="00:37:53.099" style="s2">he talks about this and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.150" end="00:37:54.569" style="s2">that the ethics was actually designed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.099" end="00:37:56.579" style="s2">do this you have this tremendously tight</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.569" end="00:37:58.890" style="s2">logical structure but the logical</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.579" end="00:38:00.599" style="s2">structure is trying to afford what he</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.890" end="00:38:03.500" style="s2">called ciencia into ateva</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.599" end="00:38:09.480" style="s2">this sort of deeply intuitive knowing</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.500" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">and what he means by that is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.480" end="00:38:15.299" style="s2">got this tremendous argument that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:18.270" style="s2">reaches up to the sort of the largest</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.299" end="00:38:21.329" style="s2">scale of reality right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.270" end="00:38:25.170" style="s2">individual premises along the way and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.329" end="00:38:27.660" style="s2">the idea here is here&#39;s the analogy so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.170" end="00:38:30.359" style="s2">the premise is like the letter the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.660" end="00:38:32.309" style="s2">premises are like the letters right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.359" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">the oh the whole the argument of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.309" end="00:38:36.299" style="s2">arguments all the arguments constellated</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:38.099" style="s2">together so I&#39;m gonna call this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.299" end="00:38:40.559" style="s2">Metta argument the arguments of learning</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.099" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">right so these go up into arguments</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.559" end="00:38:47.339" style="s2">right and then the arguments right go up</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">into Metta the Metta argument and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.339" end="00:38:53.069" style="s2">of course is like you know the through</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:54.569" style="s2">words into sentences kind of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.069" end="00:38:56.790" style="s2">remember we talked about how your</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.569" end="00:38:59.790" style="s2">attention is multiplied layered in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.790" end="00:39:02.250" style="s2">way and what can happen is if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.790" end="00:39:06.119" style="s2">practice the ethics you get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.250" end="00:39:08.790" style="s2">where you see the whole of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.119" end="00:39:11.309" style="s2">in each the Metta argument in each</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.790" end="00:39:14.220" style="s2">premise and you see how each premise and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.309" end="00:39:16.770" style="s2">each argument fit into and contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.220" end="00:39:19.319" style="s2">the whole just like you&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.770" end="00:39:21.720" style="s2">words in terms of the sentence and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.319" end="00:39:23.609" style="s2">letters in terms of the words right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.720" end="00:39:26.579" style="s2">it simultaneously bottom-up and top-down</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.609" end="00:39:29.130" style="s2">in a completely interpenetrating fashion</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.579" end="00:39:31.700" style="s2">and what you get is you get a cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.130" end="00:39:34.319" style="s2">perspective that is right</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.700" end="00:39:36.559" style="s2">interpenetrating with the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.319" end="00:39:40.949" style="s2">your individual moment of thought</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.970" end="00:44:29.120" style="s2">we see a cross or traditions the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.630" end="00:44:32.440" style="s2">internalizing the sage to create an</p>

<p begin="00:44:43.820" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">give us tremendous help there is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.340" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">had a lot of increase in our knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.060" end="00:45:03.220" style="s2">they work and how they&#39;re all operating</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.850" end="00:45:13.090" style="s2">and what we need is right an</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.580" end="00:45:13.090" style="s2">internalized representation</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:20.460" style="s2">a model a role model and a role as a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.150" end="00:45:24.270" style="s2">of taking on a new identity right we</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.460" end="00:45:27.059" style="s2">need a role model for how we can engage</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.270" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">in dialogue and the proposal here which</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.059" end="00:45:31.980" style="s2">is of course the Platonic proposal we</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:34.770" style="s2">already saw that if I can internalize my</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.980" end="00:45:37.349" style="s2">capacity and and and and develop by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.770" end="00:45:41.099" style="s2">store it&#39;s my capacity to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.349" end="00:45:43.950" style="s2">the sage eventually I get that ability</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.099" end="00:45:49.079" style="s2">that I have only with the sage I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.950" end="00:45:52.710" style="s2">have it with myself within myself and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.079" end="00:45:54.599" style="s2">means therefore that it becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.710" end="00:45:56.970" style="s2">my metacognitive machinery the way I</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.599" end="00:45:59.780" style="s2">dialogue with myself and get the various</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.970" end="00:46:01.589" style="s2">aspects of myself to various centers to</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.780" end="00:46:03.540" style="s2">dialogue with each other and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.589" end="00:46:06.450" style="s2">various versions of this you can see</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.540" end="00:46:08.520" style="s2">Jung&#39;s use of active imagination as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:11.220" style="s2">way of trying to create an inner</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.520" end="00:46:16.049" style="s2">dialogue between different centers of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.220" end="00:46:19.049" style="s2">the psyche right you can see practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.049" end="00:46:21.569" style="s2">like lectio Divina where I am reading</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.049" end="00:46:24.359" style="s2">the text and I am trying to get the text</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.569" end="00:46:26.220" style="s2">to speak to me is also allowing aspects</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.359" end="00:46:28.589" style="s2">of the different aspects of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.220" end="00:46:33.540" style="s2">to talk to each other through the text</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.589" end="00:46:36.839" style="s2">so there is a lot we can do so as I</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.540" end="00:46:42.150" style="s2">mentioned to you the process of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.839" end="00:46:45.030" style="s2">identification where you&#39;re identifying</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.150" end="00:46:48.930" style="s2">with something like the the sage right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.030" end="00:46:51.720" style="s2">obviously it makes use of our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.930" end="00:46:55.410" style="s2">for internalizing the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.720" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">others but it also requires our what</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.410" end="00:47:03.569" style="s2">Pelini called the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:08.099" style="s2">indwelling right so remember indwelling</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.569" end="00:47:10.799" style="s2">is when I&#39;m I&#39;m proceeding through the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.099" end="00:47:13.470" style="s2">pen I&#39;m indwelling it so you not only</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.799" end="00:47:14.849" style="s2">have to internalize the sage but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.470" end="00:47:17.130" style="s2">have to indwell is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.849" end="00:47:19.020" style="s2">practice right and that&#39;s fits within</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.130" end="00:47:21.510" style="s2">with others to practice trying to in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.020" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">what does it look like right what is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:26.789" style="s2">like to see things the way the sage does</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:29.160" style="s2">you have to seriously play</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.789" end="00:47:31.859" style="s2">this age without pretense or arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.160" end="00:47:33.749" style="s2">or inflation that&#39;s why wisdom is going</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.859" end="00:47:38.729" style="s2">to matter to all of this right</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.749" end="00:47:42.539" style="s2">so I practice indwelling the sage right</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.729" end="00:47:43.709" style="s2">and you yet you know and people think</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.539" end="00:47:45.749" style="s2">what would Socrates do what would</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.709" end="00:47:48.059" style="s2">Aristotle do what would Jesus do right</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.749" end="00:47:50.519" style="s2">and you have to regularly practice so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.059" end="00:47:52.890" style="s2">you practice indwelling and then you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.519" end="00:47:54.769" style="s2">practice internalizing and you practice</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:48:00.779" style="s2">indwelling and then you practice</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.769" end="00:48:03.689" style="s2">internalizing right and that is how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.779" end="00:48:06.239" style="s2">basically start to afford the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.689" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">internalization of the sage and the</p>

<p begin="00:48:11.669" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">long ago to converse with yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.009" end="00:48:20.179" style="s2">get to enter into something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:20.179" style="s2">platonic dialogue with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.700" end="00:48:33.049" style="s2">all right what about alienation so</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.069" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">alienation takes us towards something</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.049" end="00:48:38.109" style="s2">talked about by Emile Durkheim and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:42.710" style="s2">Viktor Turner and others communitas</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.109" end="00:48:44.780" style="s2">communitas is what you feel when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.710" end="00:48:46.339" style="s2">watching with other people what has</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.780" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">happened recently the Raptors and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.339" end="00:48:51.890" style="s2">everybody was gathered together and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:54.049" style="s2">have shared attention and we are getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.890" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">in sync together and we have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.049" end="00:48:58.690" style="s2">of community and communicating with each</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">other and there is a shared spirit</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.690" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">amongst us all</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.569" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">that&#39;s communitas that&#39;s communitas</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:20.059" style="s2">communitas right is basically a way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:22.490" style="s2">getting collective flow going but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.059" end="00:49:26.540" style="s2">also something else it&#39;s a collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.490" end="00:49:29.510" style="s2">flow in which we feel like there is real</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.540" end="00:49:32.210" style="s2">communication between people and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">something deeper there&#39;s real communion</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.210" end="00:49:39.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:39.220" style="s2">shared identity of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.680" end="00:49:49.670" style="s2">so this has to be with looked this has</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.700" end="00:49:56.030" style="s2">to do with sorry taking a careful look</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.670" end="00:50:02.210" style="s2">at our careful look at the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.030" end="00:50:05.740" style="s2">our practices of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.210" end="00:50:11.840" style="s2">communing have been so undermined by</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.740" end="00:50:18.620" style="s2">bullshitting and modal confusion and an</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.840" end="00:50:22.580" style="s2">adversarial political culture etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.620" end="00:50:25.190" style="s2">what&#39;s been happening and as I said part</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.580" end="00:50:26.990" style="s2">of the gift of the video series is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.190" end="00:50:31.160" style="s2">gotten to meet more and more people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.990" end="00:50:33.020" style="s2">are trying to do this there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.160" end="00:50:38.620" style="s2">trying to they&#39;re putting real time and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.020" end="00:50:41.830" style="s2">talent into cultivating individual and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.620" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">communal responses to the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.830" end="00:50:49.220" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got to interact with for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:52.430" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh who&#39;s been introducing</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.220" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">me to authentic discourse authentic</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.430" end="00:50:59.060" style="s2">relating practices I will talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:51:01.610" style="s2">bit about this in a minute and then for</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.060" end="00:51:04.130" style="s2">example I&#39;ve got to meet and have some</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.610" end="00:51:05.900" style="s2">interesting dialogue the in one</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.130" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">interview not one interview sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.900" end="00:51:12.950" style="s2">dialogue with him is out and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:17.620" style="s2">another one coming because what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.950" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">Hall is trying to do is he&#39;s trying to</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.390" end="00:51:28.910" style="s2">see him trying to do he&#39;s trying to free</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.710" end="00:51:32.020" style="s2">communication from the the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.910" end="00:51:35.030" style="s2">grammar that has got us where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.020" end="00:51:37.580" style="s2">that since he&#39;s trying to respond deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.030" end="00:51:40.820" style="s2">to the history not in theory but in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.580" end="00:51:43.010" style="s2">actual practice and and that is bound up</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.820" end="00:51:44.270" style="s2">with as my argument has tried to show it</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.010" end="00:51:47.750" style="s2">that is bound up with the project of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.270" end="00:51:49.970" style="s2">trying to re-access in a powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.750" end="00:51:52.130" style="s2">perspicacious manner these other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.970" end="00:51:53.310" style="s2">of knowing and that making our</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.310" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">communion not just a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.790" end="00:52:01.860" style="s2">propositional exchange or conflict but</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:04.140" style="s2">trying to tap into right the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.860" end="00:52:05.700" style="s2">procedural knowing and how that</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.140" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">procedural knowing is dependent on the</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:12.360" style="s2">awareness the perspective of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.170" end="00:52:15.530" style="s2">how that is ultimately dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.360" end="00:52:19.950" style="s2">participatory process of our ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.530" end="00:52:22.620" style="s2">evolving attunement from which the agent</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.950" end="00:52:25.290" style="s2">and the arena co emerge and so I see him</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.620" end="00:52:30.990" style="s2">trying to do that I see him trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.290" end="00:52:35.250" style="s2">create a way in which we can get what he</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.990" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">calls coherence a kind of community I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.250" end="00:52:43.530" style="s2">would say that is directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:45.300" style="s2">engaging the collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.530" end="00:52:47.000" style="s2">distributed cognition and remember that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.300" end="00:52:49.110" style="s2">most of our real-world problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.000" end="00:52:51.060" style="s2">contrary to the we tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.110" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">ourselves about how we&#39;re self-made</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.060" end="00:52:57.660" style="s2">individuals most of our problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:59.820" style="s2">is done in concert serious play concert</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.660" end="00:53:02.340" style="s2">music is done in concert with other</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.820" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">people and so what he is trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.340" end="00:53:08.280" style="s2">create us stands towards right a state</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:12.270" style="s2">called coherence in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.280" end="00:53:15.390" style="s2">creating a kind of community cast that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.270" end="00:53:18.380" style="s2">is marshalling distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.390" end="00:53:24.630" style="s2">it&#39;s collective intelligence for</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.380" end="00:53:26.820" style="s2">simultaneously freeing us from the ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.630" end="00:53:29.700" style="s2">in which we are boxed in like the nine</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.820" end="00:53:34.440" style="s2">dog problem by our historical cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.700" end="00:53:38.490" style="s2">cognitive grammar access the other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.440" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">of knowing and bring that to bear on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.490" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">problems that we are facing so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">talk a little bit I&#39;ll just introduce</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:50.130" style="s2">the idea there&#39;s a book I&#39;m Co hearing</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:51.840" style="s2">the integral we space enabling</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.130" end="00:53:55.020" style="s2">collective emergence wisdom and healing</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.840" end="00:53:59.700" style="s2">in groups I&#39;ve gone to a circling</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.020" end="00:54:03.600" style="s2">practice already I&#39;m not an expert in it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.700" end="00:54:05.980" style="s2">I&#39;m I want to become one I want I want</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.600" end="00:54:09.010" style="s2">to take it&#39;s here I take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.980" end="00:54:12.910" style="s2">so I&#39;m only gesturing towards it but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.010" end="00:54:14.290" style="s2">is a communal practice in which this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.910" end="00:54:16.900" style="s2">my best way of trying to explain it to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.290" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging in something like share</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.900" end="00:54:21.340" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging in a mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:24.490" style="s2">practice something like platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.340" end="00:54:27.310" style="s2">dialogue and you&#39;re creating something</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.490" end="00:54:31.270" style="s2">like a collective flow state so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.310" end="00:54:35.230" style="s2">what emerges right is a dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.270" end="00:54:36.790" style="s2">and as I basically have been proposing</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.230" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2">throughout this the last few lectures</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.790" end="00:54:43.090" style="s2">that the word spirit is basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:47.290" style="s2">pointing towards dynamical systems that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.090" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">right are evolving we create a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.290" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">system that gives people the resources</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:58.690" style="s2">to address their capacity for being in</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:00.580" style="s2">touch with themselves in each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.690" end="00:55:02.530" style="s2">not therapy although it overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.580" end="00:55:05.170" style="s2">some of the the gnosis in therapy as</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.530" end="00:55:06.610" style="s2">well you know this you know that you eat</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.170" end="00:55:08.050" style="s2">when things are right and you get in</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.610" end="00:55:10.450" style="s2">sync with another person or another</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.050" end="00:55:11.590" style="s2">group of people there&#39;s a and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.450" end="00:55:14.020" style="s2">about this with platonic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.590" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">something emerges there&#39;s a collective</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.020" end="00:55:20.830" style="s2">right that emerges there that takes your</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:23.710" style="s2">cognition and everybody else&#39;s in places</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.830" end="00:55:26.710" style="s2">that you can&#39;t go individually you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.710" end="00:55:29.590" style="s2">participate in that but you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.710" end="00:55:31.450" style="s2">it you&#39;re not just a passive recipient</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.590" end="00:55:34.600" style="s2">of it you know just a patient of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.450" end="00:55:37.090" style="s2">right you&#39;re participating in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.600" end="00:55:40.870" style="s2">I want to know I want to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.090" end="00:55:43.510" style="s2">about this but dairy is a growing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.870" end="00:55:46.360" style="s2">this is this the the circling practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.510" end="00:55:49.150" style="s2">overlaps with other practices that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.360" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">and I are learning about where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.150" end="00:55:54.100" style="s2">Peter talks about you know a process he</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.230" style="s2">calls the anti debate where we turn</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.100" end="00:55:58.450" style="s2">adversarial debating we have techniques</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.230" end="00:56:01.690" style="s2">for turning it into authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.450" end="00:56:05.110" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to get insight rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.690" end="00:56:07.690" style="s2">than victory in our our debating</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.110" end="00:56:09.340" style="s2">processes there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of books</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.690" end="00:56:12.940" style="s2">coming out on this like you know verbal</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.340" end="00:56:16.090" style="s2">Aikido and verbal judo so there is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.940" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">beginning of a whole set of practices</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.090" end="00:56:20.140" style="s2">for bringing about authentic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:29.380" style="s2">that can really address</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.140" end="00:56:31.840" style="s2">the issues of alienation okay now of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.380" end="00:56:34.780" style="s2">course as I said the response to</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.840" end="00:56:37.480" style="s2">existential entrapment is gnosis and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.780" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">had an extended discussion about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.480" end="00:56:42.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s interconnection with higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:43.630" style="s2">states of consciousness so I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.010" end="00:56:45.700" style="s2">talk about that that a great length</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.630" end="00:56:47.650" style="s2">please go back and look at that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.700" end="00:56:49.720" style="s2">gnosis but what I would say is that</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.720" end="00:56:55.480" style="s2">with cheap form you see this in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.610" end="00:56:57.220" style="s2">it needs that open-ended mythos that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.480" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">Gnostics talked about I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.220" end="00:57:01.420" style="s2">I&#39;m not advocating their particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">mythos I&#39;m not saying their metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.420" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">is correct but that did that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:11.080" style="s2">transgressive the open-ended ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:15.580" style="s2">right symbol the ongoing mythos these</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.080" end="00:57:18.580" style="s2">seem to be needed for the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.580" end="00:57:20.980" style="s2">gnosis and so I would recommend that to</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.200" end="00:57:30.790" style="s2">about the overall framing of this the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.870" end="00:57:32.890" style="s2">way we frame how we cultivate the</p>
