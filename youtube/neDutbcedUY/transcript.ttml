<p begin="00:00:17.050" end="00:00:20.529" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis last</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.970" end="00:00:23.770" style="s2">time we talked about how the axial</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.529" end="00:00:26.800" style="s2">revolution came into greece we first</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.770" end="00:00:28.509" style="s2">reviewed Pythagoras and then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.800" end="00:00:30.699" style="s2">concentrated especially on the figure of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.509" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">Socrates and the Socratic revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.699" end="00:00:38.110" style="s2">we saw again how issues of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:40.870" style="s2">wisdom self transcendence are so tightly</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.110" end="00:00:43.570" style="s2">bound up together we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.870" end="00:00:46.090" style="s2">Socrates and we took a look at how he</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.570" end="00:00:49.059" style="s2">has a particular conception of wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.090" end="00:00:51.850" style="s2">which what we find salient irrelevant is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.059" end="00:00:54.550" style="s2">closely closely coupled to what we find</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.850" end="00:00:56.860" style="s2">true or real and those two things those</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.550" end="00:00:58.539" style="s2">two concerns what is transformative of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.860" end="00:01:01.210" style="s2">us and what is true of the world are</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.539" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">meant to be held together and this was</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.210" end="00:01:08.830" style="s2">pivotal in Socrates&#39;s method of trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:11.500" style="s2">to get people to realize how much they</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.830" end="00:01:13.690" style="s2">all of us are so prone to having those</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.500" end="00:01:16.270" style="s2">two come uncoupled from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.690" end="00:01:18.790" style="s2">we become subject to and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.270" end="00:01:22.090" style="s2">self-deception and that a life that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.790" end="00:01:23.710" style="s2">beset by self deceptive self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.090" end="00:01:26.920" style="s2">behavior is not a life that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.710" end="00:01:30.189" style="s2">living that way to afford human</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.920" end="00:01:32.860" style="s2">flourishing is by developing the skills</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.189" end="00:01:34.930" style="s2">the wisdom to keep those two tightly</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.860" end="00:01:37.299" style="s2">coupled together and Socrates was so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.930" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">convinced of how important this was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.299" end="00:01:42.100" style="s2">fact to making a life meaningful that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:44.020" style="s2">was prepared to die for it and as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.100" end="00:01:48.700" style="s2">mentioned there was somebody who was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.020" end="00:01:50.350" style="s2">follower of him who was at his trial not</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.700" end="00:01:53.020" style="s2">present at his death but was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.350" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">traumatized and affected by his death</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.020" end="00:01:59.049" style="s2">and this is of course Plato</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">now if Socrates was controversial Plato</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.049" end="00:02:06.700" style="s2">is beyond even that statement every year</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:11.350" style="s2">there are hundreds of books written</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.700" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">about Plato this is why Plato is one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.350" end="00:02:15.790" style="s2">the foundations not only because of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:18.459" style="s2">ideas but as we&#39;ll see there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.790" end="00:02:20.950" style="s2">inexhaustible nurse to Plato and his</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.459" end="00:02:22.540" style="s2">writing we can come back to Plato as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.950" end="00:02:24.099" style="s2">culture we come back at different times</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.540" end="00:02:26.050" style="s2">and see things we did not see before</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.099" end="00:02:28.900" style="s2">that are transformative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.050" end="00:02:30.340" style="s2">as individuals myself personally you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.900" end="00:02:31.810" style="s2">come back to Plato at different times of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.340" end="00:02:34.540" style="s2">your life and Plato speaks to you in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.810" end="00:02:36.100" style="s2">ways he did not speak before I want you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.540" end="00:02:38.380" style="s2">to remember that because I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.100" end="00:02:40.270" style="s2">and suggest to you that that is a better</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.380" end="00:02:42.700" style="s2">model for what we mean by something</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.270" end="00:02:45.130" style="s2">being sacred than it being filled with</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.700" end="00:02:46.960" style="s2">some kind of supernatural presence that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.130" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">what makes something sacred is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.960" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">an inexhaustible fount of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.760" style="s2">intelligibility that&#39;s transformative of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:57.520" style="s2">us that&#39;s certainly the way many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.760" end="00:02:59.830" style="s2">in the ancient world read Plato they</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.520" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">were deeply affected by him I would go</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.830" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">so far as to say the platonism are</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">Neoplatonism as verse lewis and others</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">argue is sort of the bedrock of Western</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:15.130" style="s2">spirituality and we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">now Plato was traumatized by the death</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.130" end="00:03:22.510" style="s2">of Socrates it&#39;s deeply I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:24.520" style="s2">disturbing to him why I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.510" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">because he keeps coming back to it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.520" end="00:03:30.280" style="s2">and trying to try and understand he</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:32.350" style="s2">wanted to understand how is it that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.280" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">city he loved the city he belonged to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.350" end="00:03:38.230" style="s2">Athens could have killed this man that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">he admired and loved so deeply how is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.230" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">that his beloved Athens killed his</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">beloved Socrates so where where Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:51.730" style="s2">had this sort of dilemma given to him by</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:55.480" style="s2">the gods Plato has this dilemma given to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.730" end="00:03:57.550" style="s2">him by the death of Socrates Plato</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.480" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">wanted to understand how people could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.550" end="00:04:03.459" style="s2">so foolish and so what he&#39;s gonna do is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna take that two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.459" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">mythology that we talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:09.670" style="s2">lower less real world and remember it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">myth mythological it&#39;s not meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.670" end="00:04:14.739" style="s2">literally two worlds but he&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.220" end="00:04:16.510" style="s2">that two worlds mythology and he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.739" end="00:04:18.459" style="s2">to do something with it very different</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.510" end="00:04:20.919" style="s2">than what the Hebrews did remember the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.459" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">Hebrews turned it into this is where</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.919" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">things are fallen now but we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:27.850" style="s2">towards the future we&#39;re progressing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:31.690" style="s2">towards the future so they give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.850" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">historical answer to how we move from</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.690" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">the world of illusion to the world of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">reality Plato is not going to give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:41.910" style="s2">historical answer he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">to give a scientific answer because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.910" end="00:04:45.210" style="s2">Plato is deeply influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.500" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">natural philosophers that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.210" end="00:04:50.760" style="s2">about last time and what Plato is in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:52.230" style="s2">fact going to do is he&#39;s going to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.760" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">the first psychological theory in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.230" end="00:04:56.700" style="s2">history with Plato you can really see</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:57.960" style="s2">the beginning not just of science but</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:05:01.230" style="s2">the beginning of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.960" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">psychology as a discipline begins in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.230" end="00:05:05.040" style="s2">very important sense and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:06.230" style="s2">this trivially like oh yeah it started</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.040" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.230" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">Plato&#39;s psychology is still currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.960" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">relevant right now in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about so let&#39;s get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">that because this is again going to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2">us into these interconnected issues of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:29.760" style="s2">meaning wisdom self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.600" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">altered states of consciousness etc I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.760" end="00:05:34.670" style="s2">gonna hope to show you how Plato in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:36.780" style="s2">trying to answer the question of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.670" end="00:05:39.090" style="s2">Athens could have killed Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">ultimately influenced not just by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.090" end="00:05:44.820" style="s2">Socrates but also by Pythagoras we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">that Plato spent some time with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.820" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">Pythagorean community and he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">have gone through something some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:59.490" style="s2">training in that community so Plato</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.770" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">develops a particular theory about why</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.490" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">human beings do foolish things when</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">there&#39;s different aspects of it but a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:12.750" style="s2">good way to think about it is by</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:15.870" style="s2">relating it to something that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.750" end="00:06:19.590" style="s2">familiar with this is the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.870" end="00:06:22.320" style="s2">inner conflict and a conflict is when</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.590" end="00:06:24.600" style="s2">you have two strong motives that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.320" end="00:06:25.980" style="s2">be working against each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.600" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">can see how this is immediately going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.980" end="00:06:30.990" style="s2">be relevant to existential meaning -</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:35.460" style="s2">meaning in life because very often we</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.990" end="00:06:38.730" style="s2">feel most distraught most anxious or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.460" end="00:06:40.590" style="s2">most sense of being stuck when we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.730" end="00:06:45.060" style="s2">such inner conflict when we&#39;re divided</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.590" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">against ourselves in an important way so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.060" end="00:06:50.630" style="s2">here&#39;s a classic example right so I like</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2">chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.630" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">I&#39;m more than like chocolate chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">mmm has a kind of deep attraction for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">so now recently I lost about 20 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:06.980" style="s2">right so I went on a diet now dieting is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">one of the most unsuccessful thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.980" end="00:07:12.920" style="s2">human beings can do the recidivism rate</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.120" end="00:07:43.010" style="s2">of the problem it&#39;s such a pressing</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.670" end="00:07:50.990" style="s2">well the problem is right it goes like</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.250" end="00:07:53.150" style="s2">this and we&#39;ll talk about the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.990" end="00:07:56.420" style="s2">science about this I know I should lose</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.150" end="00:07:58.700" style="s2">weight like there&#39;s the evidence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.420" end="00:08:01.250" style="s2">clear makes rational sense to me I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.700" end="00:08:03.230" style="s2">should lose weight yes yes okay I should</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.250" end="00:08:05.810" style="s2">lose weight and then I go home and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.230" end="00:08:09.560" style="s2">they&#39;re sitting on the counter there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.810" end="00:08:10.850" style="s2">some chocolate cake right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.560" end="00:08:13.580" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t quite capture right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.850" end="00:08:16.520" style="s2">not just sitting there it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.580" end="00:08:19.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like how men with its chocolaty</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:29.480" style="s2">up sort of often just eating the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:33.460" style="s2">chocolate cake or another example you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.480" end="00:08:38.690" style="s2">might be familiar with procrastination I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.460" end="00:08:42.110" style="s2">know my students face this right yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.690" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">I have an essay due in two weeks two</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.110" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">weeks there it is I should work on my</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:48.860" style="s2">essay tonight because if I start now I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:50.510" style="s2">won&#39;t be rushed I know if I&#39;m not rushed</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.860" end="00:08:51.860" style="s2">I&#39;ll do a great job I&#39;ll have more time</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.510" end="00:08:54.350" style="s2">to research I&#39;ll be able to change my</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.860" end="00:08:57.950" style="s2">mind I should start working on my essay</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.350" end="00:08:59.720" style="s2">tonight nobody calls up want to go up</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.950" end="00:09:01.829" style="s2">for some drinks yeah and you&#39;re gone and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.720" end="00:09:08.769" style="s2">you procrastinate</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.829" end="00:09:11.709" style="s2">so we are clearly beset by this inner</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.769" end="00:09:14.139" style="s2">conflict and Plato Plato gets this great</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.709" end="00:09:15.930" style="s2">insight he gets the insight that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.139" end="00:09:19.800" style="s2">seems to be a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.930" end="00:09:24.790" style="s2">inner conflict and self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.800" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">self-destructive self-deception so Plato</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.790" end="00:09:30.730" style="s2">posits an idea that has become again so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">natural to us that we just think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.730" end="00:09:36.490" style="s2">of course but again he comes up with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">pedda comes up with the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.490" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">have different centers in the psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:46.779" style="s2">each Center has a different cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:48.550" style="s2">relationship to the world and motivates</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.779" end="00:09:51.579" style="s2">us in different ways and he represented</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.550" end="00:09:54.819" style="s2">this mythologically right</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.579" end="00:09:56.860" style="s2">he said there&#39;s like a part of us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.819" end="00:09:59.110" style="s2">like a man I want to say something here</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.860" end="00:10:02.589" style="s2">right now because although Athenian</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.110" end="00:10:05.199" style="s2">democracy is horribly sexist and treats</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.589" end="00:10:07.509" style="s2">women horribly and so remember that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.199" end="00:10:11.139" style="s2">context because what&#39;s intriguing is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.509" end="00:10:14.139" style="s2">much Plato was able to rise above that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.139" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">Plato argues that women should rule as</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.139" end="00:10:18.250" style="s2">well as men that women should be in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:20.949" style="s2">army as well as men now he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.250" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">perfectly free himself of course from</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.949" end="00:10:25.660" style="s2">sexism but given the context I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:28.029" style="s2">it&#39;s very admirable the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.660" end="00:10:30.910" style="s2">he was able to do it nevertheless he</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.029" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">does use this idea of a man that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.910" end="00:10:41.319" style="s2">your head and represents reasoned and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:46.060" style="s2">that man is motivated by the true by</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.319" end="00:10:48.220" style="s2">truth what&#39;s true so he cares about</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.060" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">truth and falsity that&#39;s what it cares</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.220" end="00:10:56.130" style="s2">about right and right scope right you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.130" style="s2">can go into very long-term goals</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">and it can deal with very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:14.520" style="s2">entities like your health or a si all</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:18.750" style="s2">right very abstract entities so this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.520" end="00:11:20.280" style="s2">you know health and I should lose weight</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:22.350" style="s2">that&#39;s going to take me several months</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.280" end="00:11:24.570" style="s2">and I should do that because it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.350" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">that if I lose weight my health will</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.570" end="00:11:31.020" style="s2">improve so why don&#39;t I just do it well</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">because opposed to it there&#39;s a monster</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.020" end="00:11:43.620" style="s2">right and it&#39;s sort of in my stomach and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:46.250" style="s2">genitals right and it represents</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.620" end="00:11:46.250" style="s2">appetite</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:56.930" style="s2">now it does not work in terms of truth</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.740" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">and falsity it works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.930" end="00:12:06.740" style="s2">pleasure and pain very different set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">norms now there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.740" end="00:12:12.260" style="s2">operating in terms of pleasure and pain</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:14.930" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a capacity to work in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.260" end="00:12:16.910" style="s2">terms of pleasure and pain your dad so</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:19.730" style="s2">Plato doesn&#39;t think the appetites are</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.910" end="00:12:21.020" style="s2">evil what he wants you to grasp is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.730" end="00:12:23.900" style="s2">they operate according to different</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.020" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">principles than the man okay so they</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.900" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">presume long-term goals no immediate</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.020" end="00:12:39.100" style="s2">when do you want the cake I want it now</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:39.100" style="s2">now I&#39;m going to the party now right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.490" end="00:12:44.810" style="s2">works in vary it doesn&#39;t it works in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.080" end="00:12:46.640" style="s2">terms of very superficial properties all</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.810" end="00:12:47.390" style="s2">I care about the cake is how it looks it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.640" end="00:12:50.840" style="s2">looks yummy</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.390" end="00:12:54.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t have some in-depth analysis</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.840" end="00:13:00.620" style="s2">right it&#39;s just ah chocolatey sweet umm</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.380" end="00:13:04.550" style="s2">so very superficial again that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.620" end="00:13:07.310" style="s2">necessarily bad often in life and death</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.550" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">situations a superficial appraisal is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.310" end="00:13:12.290" style="s2">exactly what you need I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">know a great deal about the inner</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.290" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">workings of the tiger I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">know oh crap deadly get out of here okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.940" end="00:13:30.140" style="s2">now notice how these are opposite to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.150" end="00:13:31.550" style="s2">each other now I put a space between</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.140" end="00:13:33.500" style="s2">here obviously because I&#39;m setting you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.550" end="00:13:36.350" style="s2">up for a third thing that Plato talks</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.500" end="00:13:38.330" style="s2">about but before I do I wanted you to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:41.210" style="s2">notice what Plato&#39;s doing with Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.330" end="00:13:43.010" style="s2">here so Socrates didn&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.210" end="00:13:45.410" style="s2">theory he had a practice Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.010" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">practice if you remember last time was</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:51.770" style="s2">to get people to realize how often what</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">they find salient is rushing ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.770" end="00:13:55.660" style="s2">what they find truthful do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:55.660" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.870" end="00:14:01.280" style="s2">what Plato is saying is that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.550" end="00:14:04.910" style="s2">coincidence the reason why that happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.280" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">is because we have different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.910" end="00:14:09.570" style="s2">the psyche that work this way</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:12.470" style="s2">this makes things salient to you really</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.570" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">catchy motivates you urgently right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.470" end="00:14:17.010" style="s2">this is the part that you use to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:20.850" style="s2">understand and see here&#39;s what most of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.010" end="00:14:24.960" style="s2">us face this monster is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:27.060" style="s2">racing ahead of what we understand do</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.960" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">you see what Plato is doing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.060" end="00:14:30.390" style="s2">explaining why we are so prone to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:33.860" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:30.390" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">why salience often exceeds understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.860" end="00:14:41.520" style="s2">we are perpetually vulnerable and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:43.140" style="s2">talk about why we have this now let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.520" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">back to the dieting as an example what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.140" end="00:14:47.610" style="s2">what helps though there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:50.940" style="s2">strategies you can use of course to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.610" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">improve right how you frame things and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.940" end="00:14:54.150" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that later but</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:56.040" style="s2">typically what&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.150" end="00:14:59.700" style="s2">improves people&#39;s chances of losing</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">your experience and there&#39;s good reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:11.150" style="s2">for that because as I&#39;ve been arguing</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">throughout your connection to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.150" end="00:18:15.590" style="s2">distributed cognition is one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.790" end="00:18:28.890" style="s2">now he there he sort of represents this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.560" end="00:18:31.980" style="s2">as being like in the chest and this has</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.890" end="00:18:34.140" style="s2">to do because we we feel mm-hm our</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.980" end="00:18:37.260" style="s2">social emotions and motivation in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.140" end="00:18:40.440" style="s2">chest you know your pride and honor and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.260" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">you know you know shame right things</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.440" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.950" end="00:18:52.050" style="s2">now this is problematic for us what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.700" end="00:18:54.990" style="s2">should go there because the Greek word</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.050" end="00:18:56.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a direct English equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.990" end="00:18:58.710" style="s2">sometimes people put emotion there</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.460" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite right sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.710" end="00:19:02.790" style="s2">put the word spirit there that&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.550" style="s2">but the problem with spirit is it has</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.790" end="00:19:07.170" style="s2">all kinds of spooky associations with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.550" end="00:19:10.200" style="s2">all right I&#39;m not going to translate it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:13.050" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to leave it as is this is</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:24.890" style="s2">that is motivated socially so here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.010" end="00:19:24.890" style="s2">interesting idea Plato has all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.220" end="00:19:30.690" style="s2">they there is a lot of potential</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:33.720" style="s2">conflict in this system it&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.720" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">you want to do is get it properly</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.030" end="00:19:46.130" style="s2">ordered now when you don&#39;t order it</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">think about what this means</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.130" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">salience and understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">participation get out of sync with each</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:19:56.010" style="s2">other and then we&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">bullshitting were subject to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.010" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">self-deception the more inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">we have the more likely we are to engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:07.260" style="s2">in self-deception because these two are</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">zinc and the more likely we will become</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.260" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">very egocentric so when people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:13.710" style="s2">suffering especially inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:17.490" style="s2">anxiety they tend to become more</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:19.080" style="s2">self-centered even selfish because when</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.490" end="00:20:20.970" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.080" end="00:20:23.160" style="s2">you&#39;re getting sort of a threat signal</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.970" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">some things aren&#39;t right and when people</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.160" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">are under threat they tend to become</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">very egocentric again that&#39;s adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.299" end="00:20:36.989" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna come back to this but we</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.029" end="00:20:39.359" style="s2">want to do a little bit of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.989" end="00:20:43.619" style="s2">science well why do like why do we like</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.359" end="00:20:45.929" style="s2">what why okay it makes sense that right</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.619" end="00:20:48.899" style="s2">we have this as a motivation because</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.929" end="00:20:50.609" style="s2">we&#39;re social creatures right one of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.899" end="00:20:55.349" style="s2">greatest adaptation is our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.609" end="00:20:57.690" style="s2">cooperate together so you know you throw</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.349" end="00:20:59.969" style="s2">me into the African savanna on my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.690" end="00:21:01.499" style="s2">and I&#39;m dead soon because like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.969" end="00:21:02.039" style="s2">have great claws I don&#39;t have great</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.039" end="00:21:05.879" style="s2">I&#39;m look at what is sillies structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.259" end="00:21:07.529" style="s2">right on teetering around on two feet</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.879" end="00:21:09.719" style="s2">almost always losing my balance</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.719" end="00:21:13.049" style="s2">from a long distance because I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.119" end="00:21:25.619" style="s2">know what I can do I can get together</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.459" end="00:21:27.149" style="s2">with a bunch of other human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.619" end="00:21:28.619" style="s2">we can get some pointy sticks and some</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.149" end="00:21:33.019" style="s2">dogs and then we can kill everything on</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.619" end="00:21:36.239" style="s2">the planet our ability to work together</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.019" end="00:21:42.269" style="s2">has always been adaptive so we know why</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.239" end="00:21:46.440" style="s2">this is here why is but why does this</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.269" end="00:21:48.029" style="s2">have so much more power than this well</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.440" end="00:21:55.559" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s an actually an</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.029" end="00:21:58.469" style="s2">important reason and this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.559" end="00:22:01.379" style="s2">from work started by Ainsley and others</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.469" end="00:22:04.499" style="s2">on what&#39;s called hyperbolic discounting</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.379" end="00:22:07.799" style="s2">or temporal discounting and what Ainsley</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.499" end="00:22:12.059" style="s2">and other people found is this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.799" end="00:22:13.289" style="s2">of behavior is exist across species it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.059" end="00:22:14.579" style="s2">not just something that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.289" end="00:22:16.859" style="s2">engage and you can find it across</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.579" end="00:22:18.059" style="s2">species it&#39;s even more Universal than</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.859" end="00:22:20.579" style="s2">something like flow it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.059" end="00:22:22.829" style="s2">Universal amongst human beings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.579" end="00:22:24.929" style="s2">Universal across many species so in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.829" end="00:22:30.539" style="s2">is a deeply adaptive mechanism what does</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.929" end="00:22:33.419" style="s2">this mechanism look like okay so this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.539" end="00:22:35.429" style="s2">called discounting and this is a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.419" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">bit confusing discounting is how much</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.429" end="00:22:40.079" style="s2">you are reducing the salience of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:42.089" style="s2">stimulus the more you discount the less</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.079" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">salient something is the less it stands</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.089" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">out for you the less it grabs your</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:50.830" style="s2">attention this axis is tying in a tenth</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:54.519" style="s2">sense this is the present and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.830" end="00:22:55.990" style="s2">the future so what I&#39;m showing you is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.519" end="00:22:58.330" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to discounting which</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.990" end="00:23:00.549" style="s2">means how much a stimulus is losing its</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.330" end="00:23:05.590" style="s2">salience and this is what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.549" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">is what the curve looks like okay so a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.590" end="00:23:10.360" style="s2">present stimulus has a large degree of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:12.510" style="s2">salience to it remember the monster</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.360" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">something that&#39;s in the future</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.510" end="00:23:18.549" style="s2">especially as it gets into the far</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:22.059" style="s2">future much less salience to it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.549" end="00:23:25.149" style="s2">why the monster can override the man but</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.059" end="00:23:26.440" style="s2">why why don&#39;t we like why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.149" end="00:23:30.490" style="s2">this well this is actually very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.440" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">adaptive that&#39;s why it&#39;s a universal</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.490" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">phenomenon how is it adaptive so I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:43.299" style="s2">you to think about doing your you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:45.970" style="s2">about to do something here I don&#39;t smoke</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.299" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">I do diet but I don&#39;t smoke but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.970" end="00:23:52.049" style="s2">suppose I was doing this here&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:55.029" style="s2">now and I decide to smoke a cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.049" end="00:24:00.490" style="s2">right and that could have one of two</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.029" end="00:24:02.260" style="s2">options right you know I get a coffee</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">roar I don&#39;t get a cough there or</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.260" end="00:24:06.340" style="s2">something like that right now notice and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:07.779" style="s2">I&#39;m doing this very simplistically I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.340" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">not saying that whenever you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.779" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">something there&#39;s only two effects from</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:13.210" style="s2">I&#39;m just doing it simplistic in a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:14.279" style="s2">simple manner so you can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.210" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">point okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.279" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">now the probability of now happening is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:20.440" style="s2">a hundred percent because it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">the probability of each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.440" end="00:24:25.539" style="s2">happening is 50% now when if I were if</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:27.190" style="s2">it goes this way and then there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.539" end="00:24:31.059" style="s2">more effects the probability of each one</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.190" end="00:24:35.049" style="s2">of these is 25 right and so on so do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.059" end="00:24:38.409" style="s2">see what&#39;s happening as you move into</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.049" end="00:24:40.600" style="s2">the future the probability of any one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.409" end="00:24:46.600" style="s2">these events occurring is going down</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.600" end="00:24:49.299" style="s2">very fast now here&#39;s the thing this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.600" end="00:24:50.919" style="s2">this is actually adaptive you should pay</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.299" end="00:24:54.639" style="s2">less attention to things that are less</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.919" end="00:24:56.500" style="s2">probable than happening that actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.639" end="00:24:57.260" style="s2">makes good sense the less probable</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.500" end="00:24:59.390" style="s2">something and of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.260" end="00:25:02.150" style="s2">tis the less attention you should give</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.390" end="00:25:04.520" style="s2">it imagine if you didn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.150" end="00:25:07.490" style="s2">imagine if you didn&#39;t screen off things</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.520" end="00:25:09.830" style="s2">that were low in probability think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.490" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">how you would be overwhelmed by all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.830" end="00:25:15.650" style="s2">possibilities so if I get out of bed I</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:17.900" style="s2">might twist my ankle slightly and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.650" end="00:25:19.610" style="s2">might slow me down getting to class and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.900" end="00:25:21.710" style="s2">if I slow down getting to class that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.610" end="00:25:25.160" style="s2">might have an impact on my mark and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.710" end="00:25:27.650" style="s2">might cause me to fail my course and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.160" end="00:25:30.049" style="s2">then if I fail my course that might</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.650" end="00:25:32.780" style="s2">disrupt my degree and that might cause</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.049" end="00:25:34.429" style="s2">me to failed in my career and and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.780" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">I&#39;m going to end up in Buffalo alone</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.429" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">married to a lamp or something now</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.460" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">possible it&#39;s not impossible except the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">last part you can&#39;t really get married</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:54.410" style="s2">to a lamp but right in fact here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:58.220" style="s2">hypothesis I have no notice the word I</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.410" end="00:26:00.110" style="s2">used please I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.220" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">that goes wrong in people who experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.110" end="00:26:06.679" style="s2">generalized anxiety disorder is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:09.980" style="s2">this is not working well enough it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.679" end="00:26:12.950" style="s2">screening off and making low salient low</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.980" end="00:26:15.650" style="s2">probability events so how the anxious</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.950" end="00:26:17.570" style="s2">people find things salient that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.650" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t they find low probability</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.570" end="00:26:25.429" style="s2">things too salient so this is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">adaptive this is why you have it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.429" end="00:26:28.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with it and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">problem with any adaptive machine and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.309" end="00:26:33.620" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna see later why this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:36.710" style="s2">case ok let&#39;s go back to the cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.620" end="00:26:42.230" style="s2">smoker I smoked and through a long chain</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.710" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">this is me dying in Hamilton right this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.230" end="00:26:51.860" style="s2">is the event of me dying in Hamilton</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.970" end="00:26:53.270" style="s2">lung cancer in my left lung I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.860" end="00:26:55.160" style="s2">going to write these all out this is me</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.270" end="00:26:58.010" style="s2">dying in Hamilton of cancer and my right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.160" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">lung this is me dying in Toronto cancer</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.010" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">left right this is me dying in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.580" style="s2">Burlington because and so on there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">these different deaths now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.580" end="00:27:09.320" style="s2">thing each one of those deaths has a low</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:11.030" style="s2">probability of occurring right you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.320" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">that each one of those death</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.030" end="00:27:15.530" style="s2">has a low probability of occurring but</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing about me and I bet you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.530" end="00:27:19.610" style="s2">I share it with you I don&#39;t want to just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">avoid death in Hamilton oh that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.610" end="00:27:22.730" style="s2">although that would be a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:24.470" style="s2">about death I don&#39;t want to avoid just</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.730" end="00:27:25.370" style="s2">dying in Hamilton I&#39;m from Hamilton so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.470" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">I&#39;m allowed to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.370" end="00:27:34.070" style="s2">I want to avoid death I want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:35.690" style="s2">all these deaths think carefully and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.070" end="00:27:37.730" style="s2">using this very technically but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:40.940" style="s2">speaking accurately I want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.730" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">death in the abstract I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.940" end="00:27:47.690" style="s2">avoid this death or this death or this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.390" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">death or this death I want to avoid all</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.690" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">possible deaths</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.490" end="00:27:57.680" style="s2">I want to avoid death in the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:28:00.560" style="s2">now here&#39;s the thing the chance of dot</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.680" end="00:28:02.900" style="s2">each one of these deaths is very low but</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.560" end="00:28:04.550" style="s2">if you pull them together the chance</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.900" end="00:28:08.390" style="s2">that cigarette smoking will lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.550" end="00:28:13.400" style="s2">premature death is very very high okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.390" end="00:28:15.770" style="s2">so what does that mean for me the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.400" end="00:28:18.200" style="s2">hyperbolic discounting blinds me to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.770" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s not very probable blinds me</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.200" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">to this because it&#39;s not very probable</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:23.000" style="s2">blinds me to each one of these because</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:25.400" style="s2">each individually they&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.000" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">probable but in blinding me to each you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.400" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">know what it blinds me to what they</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:31.790" style="s2">share in common it blinds me to what</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:35.410" style="s2">they all have in common and what they</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.790" end="00:28:38.510" style="s2">all have in common is a premature death</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.410" end="00:28:42.560" style="s2">by blinding me to what they have in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.510" end="00:28:44.660" style="s2">common what they abstractly share this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.560" end="00:28:47.240" style="s2">adaptive machine actually has me take</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.660" end="00:28:49.670" style="s2">another puff on the cigarette and sets</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.240" end="00:28:55.910" style="s2">me on the course towards cancer or</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.670" end="00:28:57.590" style="s2">emphysema DC now please remember this</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.910" end="00:28:59.300" style="s2">this is going to be a theme we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.590" end="00:29:00.590" style="s2">to be coming back to again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.300" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">again I mentioned it before when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.590" end="00:29:05.900" style="s2">talked about flow the very machinery</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:08.300" style="s2">that makes you adaptive is the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.900" end="00:29:11.630" style="s2">that makes you pray to self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.300" end="00:29:13.160" style="s2">self-destructive behavior part of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.630" end="00:29:15.800" style="s2">meaning and wisdom have to do is they</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.160" end="00:29:18.680" style="s2">have to wrestle with that unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.800" end="00:29:21.080" style="s2">reality the unavoidable reality is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.680" end="00:29:22.460" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t throw this away you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.080" end="00:29:24.230" style="s2">can&#39;t throw away this machinery because</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:51.050" style="s2">self-destructive fashion so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.010" end="00:29:54.470" style="s2">need to do here&#39;s the monster what you</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:08.430" style="s2">like this these two sides feed into each</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.600" end="00:40:11.940" style="s2">other and reinforce each other and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.430" end="00:40:15.900" style="s2">improve each other and this is wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.090" end="00:40:27.510" style="s2">in contact with reality now Plato has a</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.300" end="00:40:41.580" style="s2">parable or the myth of the cave and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:45.360" style="s2">a way of talking about this the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.580" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">relationship between these things notice</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.360" end="00:40:51.780" style="s2">two things here you need to remember</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:40:55.650" style="s2">this notice how much self transformation</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.780" end="00:40:58.710" style="s2">and getting more in contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.650" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">world are interconnected this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.710" end="00:41:03.960" style="s2">participatory lower knowing I&#39;m not over</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:06.540" style="s2">here as an impartial impassive sorry</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.960" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">impart impartial passive observer just</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.540" end="00:41:12.450" style="s2">forming true beliefs about this I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:14.340" style="s2">to change myself in order to see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.450" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">world and then the world changes and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.340" end="00:41:19.380" style="s2">then that puts a demand on me to change</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:21.900" style="s2">myself and as I change myself the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.380" end="00:41:23.420" style="s2">discloses itself in a new way and so on</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.900" end="00:41:27.540" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.420" end="00:41:29.670" style="s2">this is participatory knowing I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.540" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">just changing my mind this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.670" end="00:41:33.180" style="s2">knowing with my mind this is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:38.070" style="s2">with the very machinery of my self</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.180" end="00:41:43.850" style="s2">now what&#39;s plato&#39;s myth so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.070" end="00:41:43.850" style="s2">surface right pathway going down</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:53.210" style="s2">all right that leads into this inner</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.190" end="00:41:56.869" style="s2">cavern right there&#39;s a fire here alright</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.210" end="00:41:58.460" style="s2">there&#39;s people chained to chairs so all</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.869" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">they can do is look at the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.460" end="00:42:08.690" style="s2">cave then there&#39;s other people walking</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:11.060" style="s2">in front of the fire and it&#39;s casting</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.690" end="00:42:13.869" style="s2">shadows onto the cave because of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.060" end="00:42:19.190" style="s2">firelight and they&#39;re hearing the echoes</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.869" end="00:42:21.020" style="s2">and what Plato says is people take the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.190" end="00:42:24.619" style="s2">shadows and the echoes to be the real</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.020" end="00:42:31.609" style="s2">things because they&#39;re chained they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.619" end="00:42:37.250" style="s2">caught up but what happens is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.609" end="00:42:41.510" style="s2">individual gets free and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.250" end="00:42:46.520" style="s2">individual do that individual turns and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.510" end="00:42:48.470" style="s2">sees the fire and that allows them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.520" end="00:42:51.260" style="s2">realize that the shadows and the echoes</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.470" end="00:42:55.730" style="s2">aren&#39;t the real things the shadows and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.260" end="00:42:58.599" style="s2">echoes and what happens is the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.730" end="00:43:01.099" style="s2">ability to notice the real patterns as</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.599" end="00:43:03.530" style="s2">opposed to the merely correlational</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.099" end="00:43:07.160" style="s2">patterns is changed remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.530" end="00:43:09.710" style="s2">about that people start to see they</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.160" end="00:43:11.720" style="s2">start to realize oh these are what real</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.710" end="00:43:14.089" style="s2">patterns feel like as opposed to what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.720" end="00:43:16.760" style="s2">thought was real you get the taste for</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.089" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">reality development and that taste means</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.760" end="00:43:21.020" style="s2">they start to look around and explore</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">and then they realize there&#39;s a path</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.020" end="00:43:27.500" style="s2">there&#39;s light coming through it and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:29.630" style="s2">they start a journey upward now notice</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.500" end="00:43:31.430" style="s2">how this journey works when they take a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.630" end="00:43:34.190" style="s2">step forward they&#39;re blinded by the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.430" end="00:43:36.500" style="s2">light and they have to wait they have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.190" end="00:43:38.780" style="s2">wait for their eyes to adjust the self</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.500" end="00:43:40.910" style="s2">has to be transformed and then once the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.780" end="00:43:42.890" style="s2">eyes have adjusted they can see how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.910" end="00:43:44.990" style="s2">go and then they take another step and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.890" end="00:43:47.510" style="s2">then they&#39;re blinded again and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.990" end="00:43:48.890" style="s2">this slow process and Plato keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.510" end="00:43:51.080" style="s2">about at various stages they have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.890" end="00:43:53.210" style="s2">stop because they&#39;re blinded and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.080" end="00:43:54.710" style="s2">they adjust and then they gain the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">ability to see where they couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.710" end="00:43:57.369" style="s2">before it&#39;s this participatory</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:43:59.710" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.369" end="00:44:04.950" style="s2">I talked about it and eventually you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.710" end="00:44:04.950" style="s2">come up here and they look around right</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.309" end="00:44:15.279" style="s2">and what what are they looking for they</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.609" end="00:44:18.219" style="s2">want to see the source of the real light</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.279" end="00:44:19.690" style="s2">the light that&#39;s making them allowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.219" end="00:44:21.640" style="s2">them to pick up on the real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.690" end="00:44:23.950" style="s2">where is this light that shows the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.640" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">reality of things coming from and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.950" end="00:44:28.630" style="s2">only is it showing the reality of things</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:32.279" style="s2">this light is the source of the life of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.630" end="00:44:34.839" style="s2">things where is this source of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.279" end="00:44:37.690" style="s2">understanding and life and if they look</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.839" end="00:44:39.640" style="s2">around and of course they glimpse</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.690" end="00:44:42.609" style="s2">because I can&#39;t stare at it directly the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.640" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">Sun and it&#39;s overwhelming it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.609" end="00:44:52.299" style="s2">their comprehension but they see it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:54.789" style="s2">it that fills them or they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.299" end="00:44:57.279" style="s2">off and of course what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.789" end="00:44:59.319" style="s2">go back down into the tunnel rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.279" end="00:45:03.039" style="s2">right and they get here and they try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.319" end="00:45:04.420" style="s2">tell their fellow prisoners what they</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.039" end="00:45:07.269" style="s2">saw but of course they&#39;re stumbling</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.420" end="00:45:09.279" style="s2">around because their eyes don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.269" end="00:45:10.839" style="s2">anymore in that darkness and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.279" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">saying things that don&#39;t make absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.839" end="00:45:14.739" style="s2">no sense to these people and so they</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:16.599" style="s2">ridicule them and if they could they</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.739" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">would kill that individual and of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.599" end="00:45:25.479" style="s2">this is an allusion to Socrates now</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:28.779" style="s2">first of all notice that contrary to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.479" end="00:45:34.920" style="s2">what people think enlightenment is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.779" end="00:45:39.960" style="s2">just an Eastern idea this is a myth of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.920" end="00:45:39.960" style="s2">enlightenment of coming into the light</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:48.819" style="s2">it&#39;s a myth of self transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.999" end="00:45:50.920" style="s2">self transformation it&#39;s a myth of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.819" end="00:45:53.619" style="s2">coming and I mean myth in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.920" end="00:45:55.269" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about it&#39;s a parable</p>

<p begin="00:45:55.269" end="00:46:01.269" style="s2">contact with reality to see notice the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.390" end="00:46:03.489" style="s2">story is right you pick up on real</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.269" end="00:46:05.769" style="s2">patterns that challenges you it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.489" end="00:46:07.660" style="s2">blinds you and then you transform to</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.900" end="00:50:36.249" style="s2">and I want to talk now more about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.089" end="00:50:50.710" style="s2">Pythagorean side of Plato just to bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.249" end="00:50:55.720" style="s2">out a few things so Plato talks about</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.710" end="00:50:58.450" style="s2">like he uses a term I dass and that gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.720" end="00:51:01.329" style="s2">translated into the word form and when</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.450" end="00:51:03.039" style="s2">people hear the word form their shape it</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.329" end="00:51:04.479" style="s2">also gets translated into the word idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.039" end="00:51:07.690" style="s2">when they hear idea they think of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.479" end="00:51:13.690" style="s2">concept or an idea in your head that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.690" end="00:51:15.249" style="s2">not what Plato means the we need he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.690" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">using that words it&#39;s much closer to our</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.249" end="00:51:18.819" style="s2">word like a paradigm II he&#39;s using a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:20.769" style="s2">word to talk about the real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.819" end="00:51:22.239" style="s2">that we&#39;re discovering in reality now</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.769" end="00:51:31.509" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting thing about these</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.239" end="00:51:33.789" style="s2">real patterns they&#39;re both the access</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.509" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">the pathway we have to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.789" end="00:51:37.809" style="s2">something the pathway we have for</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:38.710" style="s2">getting at the reality of something</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.809" end="00:51:41.589" style="s2">because that&#39;s those are the real</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.710" end="00:51:43.719" style="s2">patterns but they&#39;re not just the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.589" end="00:51:45.249" style="s2">affordance of our knowing the real</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.719" end="00:51:55.589" style="s2">patterns are also what makes something</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.249" end="00:51:55.589" style="s2">be what it is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:07.859" style="s2">this is work also from the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.030" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">concepts and how people understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.859" end="00:52:15.930" style="s2">things well you ask people what a bird</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:18.030" style="s2">is they&#39;ll say the following oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.930" end="00:52:25.109" style="s2">well I know what a bird is right it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.030" end="00:52:27.089" style="s2">wings feathers a beak and it flies there</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.109" end="00:52:30.329" style="s2">you go that&#39;s a bird they give you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.089" end="00:52:32.010" style="s2">what&#39;s called a feature list and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.329" end="00:52:34.619" style="s2">you think that and then you can get</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.010" end="00:52:35.970" style="s2">involved in a very long process which i</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.619" end="00:52:38.010" style="s2">think is largely been something of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.970" end="00:52:39.390" style="s2">mistake we&#39;ll come back to this no not</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.010" end="00:52:41.880" style="s2">code totally because it&#39;s important in</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.390" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">science but of thinking that the way I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.880" end="00:52:47.700" style="s2">understand something is by having a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:49.849" style="s2">definition of it in terms of the correct</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.700" end="00:52:52.710" style="s2">features now there&#39;s a problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.849" end="00:52:55.260" style="s2">although people believe that this is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.710" end="00:52:56.910" style="s2">they know what a bird is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.260" end="00:52:58.710" style="s2">mistaken in an important sense because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.910" end="00:53:00.180" style="s2">could satisfy this definition in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.710" end="00:53:02.940" style="s2">following way I could put a couple wings</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.180" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">on this table a bunch of feathers a beak</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.940" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">and then throw it all up in the air have</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:12.799" style="s2">wings because in flight do I have a bird</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:16.260" style="s2">no I don&#39;t I have a bloody mess</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.799" end="00:53:18.359" style="s2">because what&#39;s missing is something more</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.260" end="00:53:21.869" style="s2">important what&#39;s missing is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.359" end="00:53:24.750" style="s2">structural functional organization the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.869" end="00:53:27.210" style="s2">way all those things hang together the</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.210" end="00:53:33.630" style="s2">the bird functions as a whole what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.230" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">missing from this is the structural</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">whole greater than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.760" end="00:53:54.330" style="s2">the Germans have a great word for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.070" end="00:53:56.730" style="s2">Gestalt in English we don&#39;t the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.330" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">have a good word for this is the word</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:03.180" style="s2">discussed a lot today I think it needs</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.070" end="00:54:08.310" style="s2">to be discussed a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.180" end="00:54:10.530" style="s2">carefully now here&#39;s the thing I want</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.310" end="00:54:12.840" style="s2">you to realize member we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.530" end="00:54:14.430" style="s2">how you pick up on real patterns and a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.840" end="00:54:17.670" style="s2">lot of those patterns you&#39;re not picking</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:21.690" style="s2">up an explicit sense you know what a</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.670" end="00:54:23.850" style="s2">bird is you have some sense of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.690" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">of it but if I ask you what is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.850" end="00:54:27.750" style="s2">logos what is the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">organization and most of that most of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.750" end="00:54:31.740" style="s2">what makes a bird a bird is found in</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.430" end="00:54:33.990" style="s2">that logos but if I ask you what is the</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.990" end="00:54:39.290" style="s2">structure together so they function as a</p>
