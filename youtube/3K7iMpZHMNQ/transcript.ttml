<p begin="00:00:09.330" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">podcast livestream complete with dog</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">tail all right we are back to answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:22.980" style="s2">your super chat questions we had with</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">dog tail and drinks yes some people said</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.980" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">that they had enjoyed us more when we</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">were drinking at the point that one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:30.510" style="s2">our previous live streams had run into</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">trouble and we had taken up drinking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.510" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">see if that would help so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">done is given that it is undoubtedly 5</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:40.290" style="s2">o&#39;clock somewhere maybe even here we</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">have gotten something to drink we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.290" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">put the kids to bed they were not happy</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">about that in light of the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">have not yet had dinner but anyway they</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">went once we properly threatened them so</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">anyway they&#39;re in bed and and we are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">free to talk to you about anything and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">everything sex drugs rock and roll it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">all on the menu ok alright so we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done the last several of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">is we can spend about an hour here we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">take the first half hour to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">as many of these questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">super chat from the previous live stream</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">as possible and then take the second</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">half hour to respond in the order they</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">come in likely unless we reject any out</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">of hand the questions from the second</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:31.790" style="s2">super chat ok so the first one from echo</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">points to an article on mosquito fish</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.790" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">for which female but not male brain size</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">is greater following selection for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.689" style="s2">longer going to podium so this I will</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">say we are going to take a look at and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.689" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">respond to in the next live stream ok</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.009" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">second question regarding culture and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">consciousness so this is a reference in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">part to the talk that we gave for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">Princeton via webinar last Wednesday six</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">days ago now and is now up on the web so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">regarding cultural and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">could psychoactive fungi have played a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">role in ancient peoples ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:09.239" style="s2">quickly make diverse and novel insights</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:11.230" style="s2">and why many just didn&#39;t cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.239" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">emerged so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.230" end="00:02:16.180" style="s2">and answer the first part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">question absolutely absolutely this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.180" end="00:02:21.190" style="s2">you know hallucinogenic I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:23.549" style="s2">we at least alluded to this in that very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.190" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">brief talk that we gave when we compared</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.549" end="00:02:26.739" style="s2">you know said culture is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.739" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">as the sacred is to the shamanistic as</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">orthodoxy is to heterodoxy as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:41.590" style="s2">conservatism is to progressivism to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:44.739" style="s2">yeah I would just add that many many</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.590" end="00:02:46.420" style="s2">cultures access that state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.739" end="00:02:50.799" style="s2">however they do it whether they do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.420" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">with sweat lodges or hunger or other</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.799" end="00:02:56.290" style="s2">extreme things or they access it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:58.810" style="s2">chemically but they wouldn&#39;t be doing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.290" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">if it didn&#39;t have a value that more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.810" end="00:03:02.170" style="s2">compensated them for the cost of it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.840" style="s2">the caught&#39; cost is significant because</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.170" end="00:03:07.030" style="s2">the fact is those states fascinating as</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.840" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">they may be are not clear-headed states</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.030" end="00:03:11.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that you want the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">captain of the ship involved in while</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.079" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">the captain is navigating in dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">waters so yes it must be adaptive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:24.190" style="s2">anyway look for further discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">that here and in our book absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.190" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">with regard to the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:30.220" style="s2">question though why many distinct</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.220" end="00:03:34.840" style="s2">cultures have emerged so quickly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.220" end="00:03:39.579" style="s2">less confident of that unless a culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.840" end="00:03:41.739" style="s2">finds itself fashioning among the lines</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.579" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">of some people follow a particular of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.739" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">shamans insights or encouragement to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:50.139" style="s2">take a particular psychoactive substance</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">biet fungi or something else because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.139" end="00:03:52.510" style="s2">it seems to me that it might take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:56.139" style="s2">little longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.510" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">upon exploring a new environment to come</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.139" end="00:04:01.299" style="s2">to a stable relationship with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.829" style="s2">psychoactive that exists there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.299" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">that&#39;s true although there are some</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.829" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">cultures that have a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">relationship with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:13.359" style="s2">psychoactive and in fact go on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:14.859" style="s2">pilgrimages which could happen in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.359" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">words a population that was in motion</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.859" end="00:04:20.049" style="s2">across the land could traverse it to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.650" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">same location to collect their peyote or</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.049" end="00:04:24.220" style="s2">whatever in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">the image that we showed when we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">talking about culture and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">being an analogous relationship with for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:33.940" style="s2">instance the sacredness shamanistic in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:36.130" style="s2">that Princeton talk was a yarn painting</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.940" end="00:04:37.240" style="s2">from a Huichol shaman and Huichol is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.130" end="00:04:39.700" style="s2">exactly the culture that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:41.470" style="s2">about that do these law everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.700" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">culture at some point is expected or</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.470" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">encouraged to go on with these very long</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:48.280" style="s2">pilgrimages the end place of which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:49.890" style="s2">hallucinogenic and Theo genic</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.280" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">exploration yep</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.890" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">all right next question is there any</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:57.730" style="s2">evolutionary advantage for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:04:59.410" style="s2">decussation of nerve fibers that is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.730" end="00:05:01.060" style="s2">crossing of nerve fibers from one side</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:02.980" style="s2">of the body to the other that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.060" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">the right hemisphere controls the left</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.980" end="00:05:11.740" style="s2">side of the body I would say it very</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:14.710" style="s2">likely passes the adaptive test in other</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.740" end="00:05:16.630" style="s2">words there&#39;s a cost even at just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.710" end="00:05:18.610" style="s2">trivial level of the nerves having to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.630" end="00:05:21.160" style="s2">travel a further distance and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">the rate of transmission on those nerve</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.160" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">nerve fibers being reduced slightly</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2">probably suggests an adaptive function</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">the only competing hypothesis I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.620" end="00:05:33.790" style="s2">imagine is that there is a historical</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.340" style="s2">constraint but I believe we see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.790" end="00:05:38.260" style="s2">pattern too frequently for historical</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.340" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">constraint to explain all the examples</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.260" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">of it so that&#39;s not an ironclad answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:45.670" style="s2">but I would say my instinct says yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:51.460" style="s2">it&#39;s going to have an adaptive value and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.670" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">I do I cannot somehow free this in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.460" end="00:05:58.150" style="s2">mind from the question of the brakes of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">a car being hooked up crossways so your</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.150" end="00:06:02.620" style="s2">front left and your right rear brake are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.250" end="00:06:04.210" style="s2">connected together so yeah your agency</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.620" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2">with control there&#39;s more there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.210" end="00:06:08.620" style="s2">control in this sort of arrangement than</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:11.020" style="s2">in just having two sides completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.620" end="00:06:12.640" style="s2">going parallel so the decussation is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.020" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">a word that actually I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.640" end="00:06:15.760" style="s2">particularly familiar with even though</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.870" end="00:06:16.090" style="s2">talk comparative anatomy for many many</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.760" end="00:06:18.490" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.090" end="00:06:22.680" style="s2">but like the chiasma the ear the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.490" end="00:06:25.030" style="s2">crossing from one side to the other is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.680" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">think and I&#39;m not a hundred percent sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.030" end="00:06:29.350" style="s2">of this but basically we have bilateral</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">symmetry you know left left animals that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.350" end="00:06:31.690" style="s2">have a left and a right that you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:33.040" style="s2">fold in the middle along an axis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.690" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">symmetry and basically get a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.040" end="00:06:38.070" style="s2">image starting</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.560" end="00:06:41.020" style="s2">basil vertebrates and then separately in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.070" end="00:06:44.380" style="s2">arthropod lineages right so insects and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">such and spiders and and then separately</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.380" end="00:06:48.970" style="s2">again in a few other lineages but if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:51.100" style="s2">take vertebrates in particular you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.970" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2">brains pretty quickly after you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.100" end="00:06:57.730" style="s2">bilateral symmetry and this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:06:59.500" style="s2">lateralization of things happening on</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.730" end="00:07:02.530" style="s2">the left side and not the right and vice</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.500" end="00:07:04.900" style="s2">versa it doesn&#39;t take too much longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.530" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">before it shows up and I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.900" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">key asthma the crossing is ancient as</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.650" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">well so it looks to me therefore like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:18.490" style="s2">it&#39;s going to add some stability and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:22.600" style="s2">that stability might just be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.490" end="00:07:24.070" style="s2">like error correction like you know just</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.600" end="00:07:25.600" style="s2">like you say with regard to brakes of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.070" end="00:07:27.640" style="s2">the car like if one part fails you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.600" end="00:07:29.410" style="s2">more likely to have things from far</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.640" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">afield I&#39;m sort of controlling what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.410" end="00:07:34.780" style="s2">what&#39;s good argument right there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:36.490" style="s2">damage might you know if you&#39;re damaged</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.780" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">on this side having the control</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.490" end="00:07:40.270" style="s2">apparatus on the side where you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.310" style="s2">just hit you could see an advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.270" end="00:07:43.720" style="s2">that yeah and I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.310" end="00:07:45.880" style="s2">not just some sort of danger of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.720" end="00:07:48.310" style="s2">feedbacks you know if you had the right</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.880" end="00:07:49.960" style="s2">side controlling the right side if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.310" end="00:07:52.990" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be in danger of getting some</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.960" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">kind of loop that might create a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.990" end="00:07:58.690" style="s2">know policy or whatever yeah it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.960" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good okay next question can you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.690" end="00:08:02.830" style="s2">please show the bear skull and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:04.419" style="s2">the bear no that&#39;s the bear skull and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.830" end="00:08:05.800" style="s2">toxiel bear phylogeny is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.419" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">evolutionary cost of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.800" end="00:08:09.820" style="s2">though purely metabolic and our other</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">and almost conscious okay so we got a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.820" end="00:08:13.240" style="s2">couple questions here so we did bring up</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:17.350" style="s2">we saw this question enough to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.240" end="00:08:20.979" style="s2">they&#39;re both bare skulls both pairs</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.350" end="00:08:24.040" style="s2">given you owe him more than that yes I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.979" end="00:08:25.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know either but my guess is having</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.040" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">asked that question this person knows</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.870" end="00:08:30.820" style="s2">full well our perspective on this which</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">is that seals are bears for the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.820" end="00:08:37.740" style="s2">reason by the same linguistic rigor that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:41.770" style="s2">we would say that monkeys are mammals if</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.740" end="00:08:43.270" style="s2">is X a Y is the same kind of question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.770" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">a monkey a mammal of course it is what</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.270" end="00:08:47.380" style="s2">else would it be is a seal a bear yes it</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:49.560" style="s2">is what else would it be</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.380" end="00:08:51.540" style="s2">because seals as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.560" end="00:08:53.250" style="s2">understand it evolved from bears there</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.540" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">within the category bear the same way</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.250" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">monkey is within the category mammal and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:00.810" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s this phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:03.300" style="s2">analysis which is exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.810" end="00:09:04.920" style="s2">question asks with regard to what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.300" end="00:09:08.610" style="s2">relationship between seals and bears and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">seals appear by every every type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.610" end="00:09:10.529" style="s2">character that&#39;s been looked at at this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:13.050" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.529" end="00:09:14.850" style="s2">morphological molecular developmental</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.050" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">all of these character sets run in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.850" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">same direction and say yep seals evolved</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:21.150" style="s2">from bears and that makes seals Bears in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:23.910" style="s2">the same way that makes monkeys mammals</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.150" end="00:09:26.910" style="s2">maybe maybe in some ways the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.910" end="00:09:28.440" style="s2">interesting question is whoa seals went</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.910" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">back to the water secondarily you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.440" end="00:09:32.820" style="s2">we all emerge from the water when</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:34.950" style="s2">tetrapods first came out many hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.820" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">of millions millions of years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.950" end="00:09:38.580" style="s2">within mammals and this is this is far</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:41.430" style="s2">afield but this is this is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.580" end="00:09:44.370" style="s2">thing that I could talk about forever we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.430" end="00:09:48.029" style="s2">have four different evolutions of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.370" end="00:09:50.610" style="s2">returns to water in mammals and only one</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.029" end="00:09:52.170" style="s2">of those returns to water which is say</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.610" end="00:09:57.140" style="s2">the pinnipeds the seals sea lions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.170" end="00:10:05.190" style="s2">walrus derived from bears we have also</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.140" end="00:10:08.400" style="s2">the whales which derived from points</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.190" end="00:10:10.620" style="s2">living clay right so whales are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.400" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">from hippopotamuses that&#39;s that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.620" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">the other two returns to the sea we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:17.700" style="s2">otters which are embedded within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.300" end="00:10:20.030" style="s2">carnivorans now so our otters otters</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.700" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">must be peeled for more can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.030" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">they are weasels which are known as</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">their kina form yeah so broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:32.700" style="s2">the chronitons or branch into two types</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:34.260" style="s2">the sort of cat-like and the doglike so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.700" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">otters are in that doglike branch and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.260" end="00:10:41.459" style="s2">then we have the manatees and manatees</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:43.730" style="s2">are related to elephant Citians yes so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.459" end="00:10:46.920" style="s2">for totally different emergencies of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.730" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">secondarily aquatic mammals so I realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.920" end="00:10:51.990" style="s2">calling you out on this on air it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:53.790" style="s2">probably a terrible thing to do but now</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.990" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">that you say you said for returns to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.790" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">water but I&#39;m thinking you know otters</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">is an edge case oh for sure right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:03.300" style="s2">return to the sea yep</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">mmm seals sea lions and whoa</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.300" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">they&#39;re an edge case in some ways as</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:08.730" style="s2">well because they return to land to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:12.120" style="s2">breathe well right so whales are fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.730" end="00:11:14.279" style="s2">Mounties are fully pen apes&#39; are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.120" end="00:11:15.990" style="s2">an otters edgy ER but as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.279" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">taking the edge cases then we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.990" end="00:11:21.240" style="s2">bunch of other edge cases too because</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:25.019" style="s2">we&#39;ve got muskrats and Desmond&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.240" end="00:11:28.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve forgotten there&#39;s a Cuban rodent</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.019" end="00:11:31.829" style="s2">that is aquatic and those are not all</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.440" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">one clade of we kind of went aquatic and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.829" end="00:11:36.660" style="s2">we&#39;re rodents mmm no oh and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:39.149" style="s2">there&#39;s beavers of course all right um</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.660" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">so anyway these are all interesting edge</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.149" end="00:11:43.620" style="s2">cases and the you know the otter if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:45.329" style="s2">say returns to the sea otter the sea</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.620" end="00:11:48.120" style="s2">otter gets us there yep the sea otter</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.329" end="00:11:49.560" style="s2">was not likely to have been first so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.120" end="00:11:51.810" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to have come from a river</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.560" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">otter which was partially terrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.810" end="00:11:58.459" style="s2">sea otters are almost entirely aquatic</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:12:00.930" style="s2">yep but anyway now we have digressed</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.459" end="00:12:03.899" style="s2">rather fully lost a quarter of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.930" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">audience right there is the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.899" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">the second part of this question was is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.640" style="s2">the evolutionary cost of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:13.829" style="s2">purely metabolic and our other animals</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.640" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">conscious know the cost of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.829" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">goes well beyond metabolic one so we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:23.790" style="s2">defining consciousness as we defined it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:26.520" style="s2">in our talk the other night which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.790" end="00:12:30.750" style="s2">that fraction of cognition that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.520" end="00:12:34.170" style="s2">packaged for exchange that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.750" end="00:12:35.399" style="s2">going to redo that talk here but there</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.170" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">are all sorts of costs to being</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.399" end="00:12:40.200" style="s2">conscious one of them I would argue is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:41.880" style="s2">confusion there are a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.200" end="00:12:44.279" style="s2">you can be programmed to detect and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.880" end="00:12:46.010" style="s2">respond to even intelligently without</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.279" end="00:12:49.949" style="s2">being conscious once you&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.010" end="00:12:51.930" style="s2">you&#39;re in grave danger of choking in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.949" end="00:12:53.220" style="s2">sense of you&#39;re up to bat and you become</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.930" end="00:12:57.240" style="s2">too conscious and you can&#39;t hit the ball</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.220" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">right now starfish don&#39;t choke no they</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.240" end="00:13:02.040" style="s2">don&#39;t I&#39;ve never seen it happen so</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:04.470" style="s2">anyway yes right there we have okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.040" end="00:13:05.640" style="s2">starfish don&#39;t satisfy our rubric for</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.470" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">are they conscious but is their</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.640" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">consciousness and other organisms such</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">as quickly identify a few oh wait I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:14.459" style="s2">wanted to say one was one more cost here</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:16.649" style="s2">which is a conscious brain is a large</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.459" end="00:13:18.779" style="s2">brain and large brains are more</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.649" end="00:13:21.480" style="s2">vulnerable so you got metabolic you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.779" end="00:13:22.920" style="s2">got danger and you&#39;ve got confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.480" end="00:13:24.809" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s just the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.920" end="00:13:27.930" style="s2">the list so yes consciousness is a a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.809" end="00:13:29.369" style="s2">costly thing it might be beneficial in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.930" end="00:13:31.379" style="s2">order to justify the large brains are</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.369" end="00:13:33.509" style="s2">also a metabolic cost oh yes it costs</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.379" end="00:13:36.059" style="s2">better run also there but built into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.509" end="00:13:39.899" style="s2">question yeah so other animals that have</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.059" end="00:13:41.699" style="s2">consciousness maybe we&#39;ll just name a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.899" end="00:13:44.490" style="s2">few and then we will encourage more of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.699" end="00:13:47.550" style="s2">this conversation later domestic dogs</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.490" end="00:13:50.519" style="s2">but also wolves toothed whales including</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.550" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">dolphins and orca elephants other</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.519" end="00:13:58.709" style="s2">primates Lions maybe parrots corvids not</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:02.970" style="s2">covitz corvids which includes crows</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.709" end="00:14:04.319" style="s2">probably hyenas yep there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.970" end="00:14:07.889" style="s2">things but what are those things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.319" end="00:14:10.470" style="s2">are long-lived large-brained have</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.889" end="00:14:11.939" style="s2">generational overlap are social as they</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.470" end="00:14:13.559" style="s2">live in social groups and they know each</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.939" end="00:14:14.759" style="s2">other and have long developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.559" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">periods which in humans we call</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.759" end="00:14:19.410" style="s2">childhoods but we are not saying these</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:20.610" style="s2">things are as conscious as people</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.410" end="00:14:23.220" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a question about what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.610" end="00:14:25.379" style="s2">fraction of your cognition is in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.220" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">conscious realm and this varies a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.379" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s not synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:34.860" style="s2">intelligence so anyway more on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:37.769" style="s2">later and elsewhere I&#39;m a stylist salons</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.860" end="00:14:40.230" style="s2">already follow zero sanitation fungus</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.769" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">very I which may or may not be the</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.540" end="00:14:45.929" style="s2">very high bacteria combined with cuts</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.069" end="00:14:48.089" style="s2">and hair slivers and bodily fluids huge</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.929" end="00:14:51.899" style="s2">air movement bad ventilation should hair</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.089" end="00:14:54.089" style="s2">salons open yet I would not be opening</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.899" end="00:14:55.889" style="s2">the hair salons yet if it were me I</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.089" end="00:14:57.929" style="s2">would be opening other things before</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.889" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">hair salons but people are going nuts</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.929" end="00:15:02.699" style="s2">over the lack of haircuts I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.129" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to tell me something</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.699" end="00:15:07.079" style="s2">yeah this is a tough question yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.129" end="00:15:09.660" style="s2">think the real question is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.079" end="00:15:13.589" style="s2">know what the answer is here there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.660" end="00:15:18.660" style="s2">tremendous danger in any of these very</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.589" end="00:15:20.369" style="s2">intimate kinds of businesses I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.660" end="00:15:23.369" style="s2">know what we&#39;re all gonna do at some</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.369" end="00:15:25.259" style="s2">point maybe we just begin to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.369" end="00:15:26.519" style="s2">each other&#39;s crazy hair which is a day</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.259" end="00:15:27.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking forward to for a long</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.519" end="00:15:31.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.570" end="00:15:33.810" style="s2">but anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s a tough puzzle but</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.200" end="00:15:35.670" style="s2">the important thing now that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.810" end="00:15:37.050" style="s2">discovered that our HVAC systems are</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.670" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">probably giving people the flu</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.050" end="00:15:40.590" style="s2">look the flu kills people every year why</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.480" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">are we comfortable with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.590" end="00:15:45.750" style="s2">our HVAC systems are spreading it now</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:49.170" style="s2">suddenly we&#39;re on that page people now</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:50.460" style="s2">are suddenly aware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.170" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain art to washing your</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.460" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">hands so that it actually works right</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:57.720" style="s2">let&#39;s not go back to just washing them</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">kind of pro forma yeah so what should a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.720" end="00:16:02.550" style="s2">hair salon look like so that this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:05.310" style="s2">the case yes how can they change in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.550" end="00:16:07.050" style="s2">future and for right now though at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.310" end="00:16:08.900" style="s2">for those of us in the northern</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.050" end="00:16:12.300" style="s2">hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.900" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">certainly I&#39;ve heard talk of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.300" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2">there are a lot of jurisdictions that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:17.520" style="s2">are closing down streets to car traffic</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:19.650" style="s2">to enable people to social distance</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.520" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">while being outside and this will</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.650" end="00:16:23.070" style="s2">potentially allow for restaurants to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:25.080" style="s2">reopen at some point for something other</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.070" end="00:16:28.020" style="s2">than takeout and have people sit outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.080" end="00:16:30.840" style="s2">to eat other kinds of businesses like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.020" end="00:16:32.700" style="s2">hair salons maybe could also be doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.840" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">some of their business outside for in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.700" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">the northern hemisphere as we move into</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:37.830" style="s2">you know late spring and summer if</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">you&#39;re in Australia this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.830" end="00:16:43.770" style="s2">harder and harder and obviously you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">weather is highly variable so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.770" end="00:16:50.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy but it is part of my toe</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:51.960" style="s2">so every you get used to when you travel</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.370" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">in a lot of the rest of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.960" end="00:16:56.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have such controlled interior</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.630" end="00:16:58.530" style="s2">spaces where you have to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.430" end="00:17:00.060" style="s2">air flow and you expect to not beat</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.530" end="00:17:02.550" style="s2">exactly the temperature that you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.060" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">counting on for the entire part of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.550" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">day yeah so I would say maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">assignment for those of you in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:14.070" style="s2">audience for whom this is your specialty</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">figure out how to deliver haircuts over</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.070" end="00:17:20.630" style="s2">zoom and I think you&#39;d have to early</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:20.630" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.690" end="00:17:27.300" style="s2">that&#39;s on the reports of 1902 backhoe</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.540" end="00:17:29.610" style="s2">users question 1 smoking bans cause them</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.300" end="00:17:31.020" style="s2">to spend more time outside could this be</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.610" end="00:17:32.490" style="s2">a factor in the strikingly small</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.020" end="00:17:34.380" style="s2">percentage of hospitalized smokers</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.490" end="00:17:35.820" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.380" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">on one of the earlier live streams and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.820" end="00:17:38.820" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry we&#39;ve done enough now that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:41.070" style="s2">no longer remember mostly which number</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.820" end="00:17:44.130" style="s2">it was in but one of the earlier live</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:45.660" style="s2">streams had the title smoking in in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.130" end="00:17:47.430" style="s2">the name smoking in the titles would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.660" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">relatively easy to find we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.430" end="00:17:52.560" style="s2">what we thought it was understood at</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:56.010" style="s2">that point but smoking bans causing</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.560" end="00:17:58.470" style="s2">smokers to spend more time outside it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.010" end="00:18:00.600" style="s2">could be a factor it doesn&#39;t seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.470" end="00:18:03.060" style="s2">that smokers spend so much time outside</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.600" end="00:18:05.010" style="s2">that it would be fully explanatory but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.060" end="00:18:08.310" style="s2">it might be partially explanatory what</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.010" end="00:18:09.810" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s obviously a potential</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.310" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">factor and one of the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.810" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">discovering in this pandemic is just how</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:17.430" style="s2">complex the interaction of factors is I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:19.470" style="s2">mean you know it&#39;s Subway&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.430" end="00:18:20.850" style="s2">local trains you know that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.470" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">level of detail that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.850" end="00:18:27.090" style="s2">thinking so yeah it&#39;s a good thought and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:28.290" style="s2">maybe must all of our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.090" end="00:18:31.020" style="s2">information come from peer-reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.290" end="00:18:33.000" style="s2">articles parentheses received pushback</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.020" end="00:18:34.050" style="s2">on the medium article presumably the one</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.000" end="00:18:35.610" style="s2">that we were talking about to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.050" end="00:18:37.890" style="s2">livestreams ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.610" end="00:18:39.780" style="s2">what makes China&#39;s style of wet market</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.890" end="00:18:41.490" style="s2">more or less dangerous than</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.780" end="00:18:44.780" style="s2">western-style factory farming for</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.490" end="00:18:47.310" style="s2">viruses yeah so all of this this is two</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.780" end="00:18:49.140" style="s2">distinct and very important points both</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.310" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">of which we have spent some time talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.140" end="00:18:53.210" style="s2">about we talked about peer review I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:56.640" style="s2">think in six actually a fair bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.210" end="00:19:01.680" style="s2">livestream six and then we also talked a</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.640" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">bit about wet markets early on when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.680" end="00:19:06.780" style="s2">still seemed like that was the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">likely source for this virus but</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.780" end="00:19:12.060" style="s2">western-style factory farming is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:15.810" style="s2">absolutely a hundred percent going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.060" end="00:19:18.870" style="s2">contribute to some superbugs at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:20.700" style="s2">the difference is you don&#39;t have in</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.870" end="00:19:24.060" style="s2">factory farming exotic meats being</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.700" end="00:19:26.460" style="s2">brought into human cuisine that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.060" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">been there for a long time so I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:32.850" style="s2">add a couple things here one just a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:34.800" style="s2">of history the first time we ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.850" end="00:19:36.930" style="s2">of the novel coronavirus we had just</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.800" end="00:19:41.400" style="s2">emerged from the Amazon where we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.930" end="00:19:45.000" style="s2">spent ten days almost su and we&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.400" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">out and it was we were in Ecuador we</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.000" end="00:19:52.290" style="s2">were taking a couple days in the otavalo</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:56.850" style="s2">region up in the Andes and a news story</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.290" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">about novel coronavirus came across the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.850" end="00:20:01.140" style="s2">phone somehow because there was one case</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:02.430" style="s2">thought to be in Ecuador and at that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.140" end="00:20:04.710" style="s2">point I looked into it and it looked</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.430" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">very much like what markets were the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.710" end="00:20:08.760" style="s2">obvious thing and I looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.110" end="00:20:10.380" style="s2">question of which bats it was and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.760" end="00:20:12.900" style="s2">all of that and I tweeted something</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.380" end="00:20:14.820" style="s2">about thinking the wet market hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.900" end="00:20:17.570" style="s2">seemed likely and I immediately got</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.820" end="00:20:21.480" style="s2">pushback from people who pointed out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.570" end="00:20:23.940" style="s2">job advertisement for the wuhan virology</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.480" end="00:20:25.230" style="s2">lab and I immediately retracted my claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.940" end="00:20:27.420" style="s2">that it made sense that it was wet</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.230" end="00:20:31.050" style="s2">markets because there was obviously much</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.420" end="00:20:33.900" style="s2">I did not know about the situation but</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.050" end="00:20:35.490" style="s2">in any case we can&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.900" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">peer-reviewed literature because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.490" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">peer-reviewed literature comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:45.000" style="s2">group that has the same bias - what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:46.800" style="s2">happening over there that cat has broken</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.000" end="00:20:49.620" style="s2">into our house again</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.800" end="00:20:51.180" style="s2">so anyway the the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.620" end="00:20:55.260" style="s2">peer-reviewed literature one of the many</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.180" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">problems with it is that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.260" end="00:21:00.180" style="s2">generate it come through channels that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:01.290" style="s2">cause them to have the same biases and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.180" end="00:21:04.680" style="s2">while the scientific method should</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.290" end="00:21:09.540" style="s2">correct for that it often does not so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.680" end="00:21:11.190" style="s2">have to engage in the contemplation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.540" end="00:21:12.390" style="s2">things that emerge outside of the peer</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.190" end="00:21:14.760" style="s2">reviewed literature and the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.390" end="00:21:16.680" style="s2">should be are they well done are they</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.760" end="00:21:18.030" style="s2">done well enough that they could be in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.680" end="00:21:21.450" style="s2">the peer reviewed literature of the peer</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.030" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">reviewed literature was better all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.450" end="00:21:25.950" style="s2">there was another part to that question</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:29.310" style="s2">it was about peer review and wet markets</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.950" end="00:21:30.690" style="s2">and I think I think you are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.310" end="00:21:32.250" style="s2">dangerous than western-style factory</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.690" end="00:21:34.050" style="s2">fire for viruses so I did want to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.250" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">something about this factory farming</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.050" end="00:21:39.270" style="s2">business we are very anti factory</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.840" end="00:21:41.060" style="s2">farming there&#39;s a long list of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.270" end="00:21:43.020" style="s2">that it&#39;s not healthy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.060" end="00:21:45.240" style="s2">justifiable from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:46.920" style="s2">the treatment of the animals it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.240" end="00:21:49.770" style="s2">healthy in terms of the product it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.920" end="00:21:54.300" style="s2">creates and it&#39;s not sanitary but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.770" end="00:21:57.690" style="s2">danger of pathogens is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.300" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">dependent on things like the form that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.690" end="00:22:02.190" style="s2">the meat comes in and how it is treated</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:04.620" style="s2">so I made a tweet that I think many must</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.190" end="00:22:08.820" style="s2">have regarded is curious earlier this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.620" end="00:22:11.670" style="s2">week when I said that I thought it might</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.820" end="00:22:14.750" style="s2">be that ground beef was finished as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.670" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">result of the kovat 19:00 epidemic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.750" end="00:22:19.680" style="s2">the reason that I singled out ground</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:21.750" style="s2">beef and believe me I like a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.680" end="00:22:23.430" style="s2">hamburger as much as the next guy but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.750" end="00:22:25.410" style="s2">the problem with ground beef is that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.430" end="00:22:28.560" style="s2">takes particles that are on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.410" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">of the meat and it mixes them in and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.560" end="00:22:33.900" style="s2">only way to purify what&#39;s inside the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:36.390" style="s2">meat is to cook it hot enough that those</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.900" end="00:22:39.240" style="s2">things would be killed and so a rare</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.390" end="00:22:40.590" style="s2">hamburger takes whatever pathogens were</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.240" end="00:22:43.230" style="s2">on the outside of this thing if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.590" end="00:22:45.330" style="s2">had some illness coughed into the meat</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.230" end="00:22:46.830" style="s2">as it was being ground sold it and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.330" end="00:22:48.540" style="s2">you served the hamburger raw well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.830" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">gonna be getting that pathogen in an</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.540" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">environment that&#39;s actually quite well</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">suited to protect it and there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.870" style="s2">way to make that safe if you grind your</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:23:00.270" style="s2">own beef does it solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.870" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">partly but not completely because still</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.270" end="00:23:04.410" style="s2">you&#39;re taking things that are on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.530" end="00:23:06.330" style="s2">outside and moving them inside so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.410" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">point is if you have a steak you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:09.870" style="s2">heating the outside hot enough and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">inside is protected by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.870" end="00:23:13.620" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s on the inside these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:15.660" style="s2">not inherent to factory farming factory</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.620" end="00:23:19.680" style="s2">farming is bad it caused the spongiform</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.660" end="00:23:21.210" style="s2">encephalopathy crisis Mad Cow by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.680" end="00:23:22.290" style="s2">of feeding animals things they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.210" end="00:23:24.840" style="s2">have been eating like the brains of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.290" end="00:23:26.730" style="s2">other animals but factory farming is bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.840" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to reasons we should halt</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.730" end="00:23:33.510" style="s2">the practice but it is not the culprit</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a culprit our friend Holly math</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.510" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">nerd asks please explain how living in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">reliably blue or lively red state should</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">affect attempts at game theory analyses</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:47.820" style="s2">on who to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:53.100" style="s2">well people our age remember the 96</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.820" end="00:23:54.570" style="s2">election when some of us wanted to send</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.100" end="00:23:56.810" style="s2">a message that we weren&#39;t pleased with</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.570" end="00:23:58.540" style="s2">Clinton but didn&#39;t feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.810" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">handing</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.540" end="00:24:06.790" style="s2">that point handing the presidency to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:09.790" style="s2">Republican and so traded votes if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.790" end="00:24:13.780" style="s2">were living in blue states traded votes</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.790" end="00:24:15.480" style="s2">with people in other states such that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.780" end="00:24:17.590" style="s2">could send a message while not</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.480" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">necessarily changing the election I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.590" end="00:24:21.190" style="s2">say we&#39;re in a very different place now</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">I think we were in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.190" end="00:24:25.150" style="s2">place then we just didn&#39;t know it yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:26.800" style="s2">and we&#39;re in it so we&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.150" end="00:24:30.670" style="s2">place as we were then well let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.800" end="00:24:32.830" style="s2">this way there has always been a defect</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.670" end="00:24:34.690" style="s2">in the idea of trading votes to send a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.830" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">message which is that to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.690" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">your antagonist and bi antagonist I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:42.520" style="s2">something like the DNC for us actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.920" style="s2">Democrats to the extent that they know</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.520" end="00:24:46.540" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to trade votes so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.920" end="00:24:48.160" style="s2">don&#39;t hurt the candidate they want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.540" end="00:24:50.740" style="s2">elect they have no reason to pay</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.160" end="00:24:54.460" style="s2">attention to you and so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.740" end="00:24:55.990" style="s2">they have cynically chosen a scenario in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.460" end="00:24:58.060" style="s2">which those of us who want to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.990" end="00:25:00.160" style="s2">progress are going to be left with</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.060" end="00:25:01.390" style="s2">something unpalatable but better than</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.160" end="00:25:04.390" style="s2">the alternative on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.390" end="00:25:04.870" style="s2">knowing that we will then come flocking</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.390" end="00:25:07.810" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.870" end="00:25:09.700" style="s2">and my point would be at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.810" end="00:25:12.700" style="s2">have to stop participating in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.700" end="00:25:14.620" style="s2">cynical game and when you do that will</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.700" end="00:25:17.950" style="s2">you hurt the Democratic Party of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.620" end="00:25:21.030" style="s2">you will but it was they who chose to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.950" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">engage in this game of chicken and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.030" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">responding rationally and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:29.650" style="s2">responding such that maybe two elections</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.330" style="s2">down the road three elections down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.650" end="00:25:33.850" style="s2">road you&#39;re no longer subject to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.330" end="00:25:36.280" style="s2">game is necessary does that mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.850" end="00:25:37.960" style="s2">costless no it&#39;s very dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.280" end="00:25:40.420" style="s2">destructive but they haven&#39;t left us a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.960" end="00:25:42.670" style="s2">better option so the fact that we choose</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.420" end="00:25:47.230" style="s2">a bad option when we don&#39;t have a better</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.670" end="00:25:48.910" style="s2">one shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone always</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:51.730" style="s2">more to be said there but I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.910" end="00:25:53.110" style="s2">going to move on for now the next one</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.140" end="00:27:04.090" style="s2">know I the problem because it&#39;s an event</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.170" end="00:27:08.380" style="s2">horizon the point is we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.090" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">happens next and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.380" end="00:27:14.560" style="s2">is certainly worrying me is that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">of the politicization of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.560" end="00:27:19.810" style="s2">circumstance has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:22.630" style="s2">saber-rattling element to it and while I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.810" end="00:27:26.790" style="s2">think even though the hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.630" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">this virus came from the lab in Wuhan is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.790" end="00:27:33.690" style="s2">much more credible than the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:36.430" style="s2">press has given it credit for the</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.430" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">that lab is not at all what the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.980" end="00:27:43.660" style="s2">administration for example seems to be</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.120" end="00:27:56.350" style="s2">very much worth our time to consider but</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.220" end="00:27:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not as troubling as the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.350" end="00:28:02.800" style="s2">government is it is not inherently their</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.680" end="00:28:04.750" style="s2">fault if the NIH was also participating</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:21.340" style="s2">understand it is I think a Michigan</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.520" end="00:28:23.160" style="s2">maybe former Republican who has just</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.340" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">declared that he is going to run for</p>

<p begin="00:28:24.870" end="00:28:31.350" style="s2">accepted as but I&#39;m hoping for the top</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.680" end="00:28:34.590" style="s2">spot on the libertarian ticket he wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.350" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">to be he thinks that he can do better</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.590" end="00:28:39.720" style="s2">than either of the Republican or the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.080" end="00:28:40.770" style="s2">Democrat and there&#39;s already pushed back</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.720" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">of course saying he&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.770" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">spoiler and if he runs it&#39;s going to be</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">yeah well would he be the spoiler or is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2">Joe Biden the spoiler I mean yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">I this is the problem and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.220" end="00:29:01.020" style="s2">yeah I think this guy is no Nader but</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:05.220" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s gonna end up taking the hit</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.020" end="00:29:07.740" style="s2">even though Biden seems to be a non</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.220" end="00:29:09.180" style="s2">contender yeah I go really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.740" end="00:29:11.400" style="s2">incumbent on the Democratic Party to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.180" end="00:29:13.770" style="s2">field candidates good enough that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.400" end="00:29:15.000" style="s2">win by a large margin and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.770" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been fielding candidates</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.000" end="00:29:20.450" style="s2">who to the extent they win win by a</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.830" end="00:29:31.470" style="s2">huge fan of the libertarian party</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.250" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">libertarianism is a philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.470" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take you very far</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:38.550" style="s2">and I think the kovat 19 M epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:41.070" style="s2">reveals much of the folly behind that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.550" end="00:29:42.810" style="s2">philosophy even if there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.070" end="00:29:45.540" style="s2">it that I agree with that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.810" end="00:29:50.100" style="s2">instantiation just doesn&#39;t cut it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.540" end="00:29:53.940" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know III don&#39;t know him in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.100" end="00:29:55.950" style="s2">particular and I I&#39;m already a bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.940" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">skeptical of this approach but I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.950" end="00:30:02.310" style="s2">think we need an approach and maybe soon</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.090" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">enough we will sit down with some more</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.310" end="00:30:07.680" style="s2">drinks and talk about something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">actually viable sounds good 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.680" end="00:30:11.990" style="s2">okay we&#39;re gonna try to rush through a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:14.790" style="s2">few more of these because there are some</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.990" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">no we&#39;re just gonna do it and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.790" end="00:30:19.020" style="s2">switch over okay Zack do you think oh do</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">you think coronavirus will remain in a</p>

<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:24.840" style="s2">seen bar or is it expelled</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.470" end="00:30:26.280" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.840" end="00:30:28.140" style="s2">I have an opinion on this at this point</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.280" end="00:30:30.510" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not really expelled what</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.140" end="00:30:34.470" style="s2">really happens behind the scenes is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:37.289" style="s2">cells that contain the virus are</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.470" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">either self destroy through a process</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.289" end="00:30:42.530" style="s2">called apoptosis or are killed by cells</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">that are trained to recognize them</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.530" end="00:30:49.289" style="s2">whether this remains in the system like</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:50.970" style="s2">one of the viruses that hides inside of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.289" end="00:30:53.130" style="s2">neurons and things we don&#39;t know I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.970" end="00:30:54.830" style="s2">say of all the things that we could know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.130" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">about this virus that we don&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.830" end="00:31:00.900" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m eager to know and I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:03.510" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.900" end="00:31:06.030" style="s2">a persistent lifelong recurring thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.510" end="00:31:08.100" style="s2">but if it was that would be very bad</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.100" end="00:31:11.880" style="s2">given takedowns of people question</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.470" end="00:31:13.559" style="s2">authorities have you considered syncing</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:47.309" style="s2">well I I think we might describe</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.020" end="00:32:25.169" style="s2">and this this wouldn&#39;t work right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.580" end="00:32:27.570" style="s2">but Tucker Carlson was actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.169" end="00:32:29.659" style="s2">early you pointed out to me I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.570" end="00:32:32.669" style="s2">wish I knew the date on this but he did</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.669" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2">diatribe and when she was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.020" end="00:32:39.450" style="s2">speaking to his base but he said long</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.040" end="00:33:50.470" style="s2">than that for right now well I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.440" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">you&#39;re very much on the right track and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.470" end="00:33:58.400" style="s2">Tucker Carlson is one of these people</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:34:01.280" style="s2">who is a capable of seeing a great many</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.400" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">of these difficult points and be capable</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.280" end="00:34:06.470" style="s2">of saying them and surviving what comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.280" end="00:34:09.889" style="s2">back I&#39;m reminded when when you and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.470" end="00:34:11.960" style="s2">were kids the saying was only Nixon</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.889" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">could go to China that anybody was</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.960" end="00:34:16.310" style="s2">further left than Nixon would have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">accused of having communist sympathies</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.310" end="00:34:19.960" style="s2">or something but the Nixon could do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">and in fact did yeah and Tucker Carlson</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.960" end="00:34:24.470" style="s2">also has the ability to say all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:26.060" style="s2">things about you know I mean I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.470" end="00:34:28.580" style="s2">him say things that I thought were</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.060" end="00:34:31.129" style="s2">dead-on accurate about class warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.580" end="00:34:32.869" style="s2">its meaning in the US and that it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.129" end="00:34:35.330" style="s2">taken place and that it has had big</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.869" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2">impacts and all of that so anyway yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.330" end="00:34:38.470" style="s2">figuring out who you can pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:43.000" style="s2">to on the other side who is not only</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.470" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">hero bowl but insightful yeah so I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.000" end="00:34:48.250" style="s2">Greg Gutfeld just had a big day and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:51.350" style="s2">extraordinary ratings beat the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.250" end="00:34:54.290" style="s2">shows in his timeslot he&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.350" end="00:34:56.270" style="s2">person who is he&#39;s also on a box right</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.290" end="00:34:59.840" style="s2">but also on Fox capable of crossing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.270" end="00:35:01.070" style="s2">aisle and very intelligent guy so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.840" end="00:35:01.210" style="s2">yeah figure out who you can listen to on</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.070" end="00:35:02.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.210" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">other side and then make a point of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.680" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">doing it and then your own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:10.690" style="s2">becomes richer but I mean the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">is how do you deal with family all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.690" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">so you know in Kurt finding those people</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:20.170" style="s2">and but get encouraging family to listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">to or watch viewpoints that they have</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.170" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">already become entrenched against is</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:28.150" style="s2">tougher yeah it&#39;s a tougher sell I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:30.910" style="s2">say I don&#39;t mean this cynically but turn</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.150" end="00:35:34.109" style="s2">it into a game right there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.910" end="00:35:36.849" style="s2">question about can you is there a divide</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.109" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">that you are not supposed to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.849" end="00:35:42.190" style="s2">cross that you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:43.540" style="s2">cross and you know over time you get</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.190" end="00:35:45.940" style="s2">better at it and the divides that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.540" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">can cross are larger and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.940" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">rewarding in fact you will find actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">you feel richer and happier when the</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">has grown and you know don&#39;t include bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.580" end="00:36:00.550" style="s2">people but frankly bad people aren&#39;t a</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:08.490" style="s2">about some things you&#39;re mistaken about</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:11.470" style="s2">some things and figuring out how you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.490" end="00:36:13.330" style="s2">cross those divides and discover what</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.470" end="00:36:14.530" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that you should and teach</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.330" end="00:36:17.470" style="s2">people something that they should know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.530" end="00:36:21.160" style="s2">that they don&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.430" end="00:36:39.310" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not even really analogous</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.290" end="00:36:40.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing yep and just two</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.290" end="00:39:33.490" style="s2">I guess or somewhere in Asia</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.270" end="00:40:05.650" style="s2">do with it so honeybees here in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.730" end="00:40:08.550" style="s2">Pacific Northwest we&#39;re in Washington</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.650" end="00:40:11.710" style="s2">state where the murder wasps have been</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.550" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">have been found are defenseless they</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.710" end="00:40:15.640" style="s2">have no idea what to do they get torn</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:17.980" style="s2">apart they get eaten their heads ripped</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.640" end="00:40:19.360" style="s2">off their hives destroyed and as if the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.980" end="00:40:22.180" style="s2">honeybees weren&#39;t having a hard enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.360" end="00:40:25.060" style="s2">time and we rely many of our food</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.180" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">systems rely on honeybee pollinators so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.060" end="00:40:32.170" style="s2">this is this is a huge huge problem that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:35.770" style="s2">said in the place where the murder wasps</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.170" end="00:40:38.860" style="s2">are native the bees that the murder the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.770" end="00:40:41.080" style="s2">murder wasps would eat have figured out</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.860" end="00:40:44.350" style="s2">a way to deal with them and they huddle</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.080" end="00:40:47.260" style="s2">around them and they basically choke</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.350" end="00:40:49.600" style="s2">them they fixate them by increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.260" end="00:40:50.740" style="s2">amount of co2 in the little bubble that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.600" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">they create around them and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.740" end="00:40:55.900" style="s2">increase the temperature and those two</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:58.840" style="s2">things basically kill the murder wasp</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.900" end="00:41:00.610" style="s2">so the bee is in wherever it is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.840" end="00:41:02.230" style="s2">these murder watches are from have</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.610" end="00:41:05.410" style="s2">behaviorally figured out a defense</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.230" end="00:41:07.030" style="s2">against them and of course in the place</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.410" end="00:41:09.730" style="s2">where there is no history of murder</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.030" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">wasps the bees are naive just like all</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.730" end="00:41:14.290" style="s2">of humanity was naive the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:17.290" style="s2">six months ago eight months ago at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.290" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">point and we had no idea what to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.290" end="00:41:24.610" style="s2">hopefully we&#39;re figuring it out how is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">it that the local honeybees could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.610" end="00:41:30.280" style="s2">taught how to deal with the murder wasps</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:33.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible but bees</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.280" end="00:41:35.290" style="s2">teach each other they actually show</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.580" end="00:41:37.240" style="s2">how to find stuff through their wild</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.290" end="00:41:40.570" style="s2">ancestors yeah hell of a waggle dance to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.240" end="00:41:43.210" style="s2">explain this one yeah so I should point</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.570" end="00:41:46.270" style="s2">out just as long as you&#39;re engaging the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.210" end="00:41:50.500" style="s2">full complexity of this our honeybees</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.270" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">are also invaders yes these are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.500" end="00:41:54.190" style="s2">native now I am very much in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.630" style="s2">the honeybees being rescued for many</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.190" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">reasons they may actually be the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.630" end="00:41:59.170" style="s2">species yeah it could be which means</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:01.030" style="s2">that you could potentially introduce</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.170" end="00:42:02.350" style="s2">this it&#39;s actually the same species then</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.030" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">you can introduce the behaviorally</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.350" end="00:42:06.040" style="s2">changes and I&#39;m much more worried</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.530" style="s2">frankly about whatever else it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.040" end="00:42:10.360" style="s2">probably pesticides that are causing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.530" end="00:42:12.190" style="s2">spectacular decrease in honeybees and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.360" end="00:42:16.630" style="s2">potentially driving their hives crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.190" end="00:42:19.300" style="s2">and things like that but the real point</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.630" end="00:42:22.570" style="s2">here is invasive species are a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.300" end="00:42:24.340" style="s2">tremendous hazard right the murder wasp</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.570" end="00:42:25.600" style="s2">thing is just at the beginning but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.340" end="00:42:27.340" style="s2">problem is once these things get</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.600" end="00:42:31.780" style="s2">sufficiently advanced there&#39;s nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.340" end="00:42:34.030" style="s2">be done about them so maybe maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.780" end="00:42:35.560" style="s2">a high level of vigilance at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.030" end="00:42:37.420" style="s2">would allow us to address the murder</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.560" end="00:42:39.190" style="s2">wasps and get rid of them so that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.420" end="00:42:42.010" style="s2">did not do what will otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.190" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">inevitable which is naturalized into all</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.010" end="00:42:46.330" style="s2">of our habitats but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">frightening and they are they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.330" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">amazing but I don&#39;t really want to meet</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:43:00.490" style="s2">one here okay so how much time to be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:43:02.110" style="s2">blip SEC okay we&#39;re gonna go through as</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.490" end="00:43:06.520" style="s2">many of these questions from the current</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.110" end="00:43:07.930" style="s2">live stream as we can is the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.520" end="00:43:10.590" style="s2">that Sweden&#39;s strategy will allow them</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.930" end="00:43:13.840" style="s2">to forego a follow-up way of correct</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.590" end="00:43:15.460" style="s2">we have no idea don&#39;t know I doubt it</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.840" end="00:43:17.170" style="s2">but we have no idea don&#39;t know for one</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.460" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not just a strategy there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.170" end="00:43:22.420" style="s2">a lot of variation between places that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:26.350" style="s2">is functioning as noise here and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.420" end="00:43:27.820" style="s2">really don&#39;t know enough how do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.350" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">suppose that if Biden gets replaced at</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.820" end="00:43:31.840" style="s2">the DNC elite don&#39;t pick his replacement</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:34.330" style="s2">how does a game be a solution not equal</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.840" end="00:43:35.830" style="s2">a viable third party maybe it does equal</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.330" end="00:43:38.470" style="s2">a viable third party or maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.830" end="00:43:42.750" style="s2">involves one of the third parties that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.470" end="00:43:46.350" style="s2">actually exists deciding to change</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.750" end="00:43:47.940" style="s2">strategies there there are viable path</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.350" end="00:43:49.800" style="s2">forward all of them are going to sound</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.940" end="00:43:53.610" style="s2">implausible at first so suspend your</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.800" end="00:43:55.830" style="s2">disbelief enough to consider them could</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.890" end="00:44:27.240" style="s2">aim to be there though well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.110" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">thing I think I see something here which</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.240" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">is a well-functioning market is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:39.030" style="s2">meritocracy a democracy could administer</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:41.490" style="s2">a market such that it functioned well</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.030" end="00:44:46.620" style="s2">this is sort of the ideal actually of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.490" end="00:44:52.980" style="s2">game B scenario is that we would create</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.620" end="00:44:54.660" style="s2">the landscape of incentives such that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.980" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">the market would do an excellent job of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.660" end="00:45:00.900" style="s2">creating value without creating harm and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:03.690" style="s2">that that would elevate people who were</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.900" end="00:45:05.160" style="s2">exhibiting merit so there would end up</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.690" end="00:45:06.750" style="s2">being disparities and wealth but they</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.160" end="00:45:09.300" style="s2">would be the result of having produced</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.300" end="00:45:12.630" style="s2">of the mythology of our market that our</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.070" end="00:45:14.910" style="s2">market doesn&#39;t really work that way it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.630" end="00:45:17.490" style="s2">produces an awful lot of harm so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.910" end="00:45:19.080" style="s2">I do think that they can coexist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.490" end="00:45:20.280" style="s2">know that the meritocracy supplants the</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.130" end="00:45:39.120" style="s2">there was a lot to recommend evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.080" end="00:45:44.190" style="s2">and that the students that we had almost</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.120" end="00:45:45.720" style="s2">to a person were open-minded and capable</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.190" end="00:45:48.660" style="s2">of doing extraordinary things and many</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.720" end="00:45:50.760" style="s2">of them did did that and we are still in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.660" end="00:45:52.260" style="s2">touch with many of them and as we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.760" end="00:45:55.050" style="s2">noted many times elsewhere it was not</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.260" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">our students who turned on Brett and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.050" end="00:45:59.850" style="s2">then us it was other people who were</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.330" end="00:46:09.960" style="s2">presumably been indoctrinated rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.950" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">than educated which was unfortunately</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.550" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">yeah I loved the idea of the Peace Corps</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.160" end="00:46:27.690" style="s2">is neo-colonial and I think actually the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:30.030" style="s2">idea that peace might be neo-colonial is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.690" end="00:46:32.120" style="s2">next so look for it well if math is</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.030" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">40 years doesn&#39;t inherently mean that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:53.830" style="s2">he&#39;s that he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.170" end="00:50:07.450" style="s2">the fact if I&#39;m not having patients</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:08.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t one of them when you say</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.450" end="00:50:11.350" style="s2">consciousness do you mean subjective</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.350" end="00:50:14.140" style="s2">of consciousness sounds more like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.340" end="00:50:15.700" style="s2">metacognition that subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.140" end="00:50:17.140" style="s2">is that right and just quickly to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.700" end="00:50:19.300" style="s2">definition and maybe people directly to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.140" end="00:50:21.640" style="s2">the Princeton talk there&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.300" end="00:50:23.800" style="s2">we have defined it the way we have which</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.640" end="00:50:26.660" style="s2">is that fraction of cognition that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.800" end="00:50:30.280" style="s2">packaged for exchange and that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.660" end="00:50:32.420" style="s2">deuced from the way people seem to mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.280" end="00:50:34.820" style="s2">consciousness when they invoke it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.420" end="00:50:36.320" style="s2">other words when people say that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.820" end="00:50:37.880" style="s2">are conscious of something how</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.320" end="00:50:42.200" style="s2">frequently does it fit in that category</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.880" end="00:50:44.330" style="s2">and it seems to fit well subjective</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.200" end="00:50:45.650" style="s2">experience is implied by this and one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.330" end="00:50:47.600" style="s2">the things that we talked briefly about</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.650" end="00:50:50.060" style="s2">in our Princeton talk and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:52.580" style="s2">more about elsewhere is the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.060" end="00:50:56.990" style="s2">subjective experience would be coupled</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.580" end="00:50:59.840" style="s2">with the fact of a cognitive thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.990" end="00:51:02.090" style="s2">being packaged for exchange right those</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.840" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">two things are related but it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.090" end="00:51:10.940" style="s2">obvious why it has to do with more or</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:12.740" style="s2">less why it is that we are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.940" end="00:51:16.370" style="s2">exchange thoughts between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.740" end="00:51:18.740" style="s2">what we do with that capacity and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.370" end="00:51:20.870" style="s2">necessity of having a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.740" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">experience that allows you to compare</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.870" end="00:51:24.680" style="s2">your thought but somebody else&#39;s thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:28.220" style="s2">to hold them both in mind and have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.680" end="00:51:30.590" style="s2">place where they can be juxtaposed so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.220" end="00:51:35.750" style="s2">anyway I hope that was a decent answer</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.590" end="00:51:41.180" style="s2">good why did we evolve hate why do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.750" end="00:51:42.620" style="s2">evolve hate you know this this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.180" end="00:51:46.700" style="s2">these questions where it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.620" end="00:51:51.110" style="s2">to me why it wouldn&#39;t be obvious why we</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.700" end="00:51:52.610" style="s2">need hate right we need hate in order I</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.110" end="00:51:54.950" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t have to be called hate</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.610" end="00:51:58.010" style="s2">maybe it could be designed in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.950" end="00:52:00.520" style="s2">and you could feel it differently but we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.010" end="00:52:03.050" style="s2">need something that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.520" end="00:52:05.600" style="s2">categorize a certain number of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.050" end="00:52:07.940" style="s2">and figure out how to oppose them I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.600" end="00:52:09.980" style="s2">think the problem is hate gets a bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.940" end="00:52:12.200" style="s2">name because often it is opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.980" end="00:52:14.030" style="s2">things that don&#39;t need to be opposed and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.200" end="00:52:16.130" style="s2">therefore it seems like a corruption but</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.030" end="00:52:17.870" style="s2">at some level I wonder if what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.130" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">on is that you need something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.870" end="00:52:21.890" style="s2">functions this way and when it is miss</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">applied it gets named and discussed and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.890" end="00:52:26.840" style="s2">when it is not miss applied it goes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:29.840" style="s2">without notice and maybe that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.840" end="00:52:31.820" style="s2">to fix it I don&#39;t know what this next</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.840" end="00:52:34.310" style="s2">question means but I said I&#39;d read them</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.820" end="00:52:35.780" style="s2">in order so here it goes how much money</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.310" end="00:52:38.870" style="s2">does the audience need to raise for</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.780" end="00:52:41.620" style="s2">science for Brett to get a perm what</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.870" end="00:52:44.890" style="s2">makes you think I don&#39;t have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.620" end="00:52:48.940" style="s2">yeah many Americans I don&#39;t know the</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.950" end="00:54:23.080" style="s2">there are errors in which I might but at</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.110" end="00:54:26.740" style="s2">the moment I want somebody who&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.340" end="00:54:40.600" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned we should elect you right</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.220" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter if you come from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.600" end="00:54:45.580" style="s2">right or come from the left because</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:47.380" style="s2">those things would cause you to behave</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.580" end="00:54:49.330" style="s2">in certain ways relative to the way the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.380" end="00:54:51.100" style="s2">nation is governed that would be very</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.330" end="00:54:53.710" style="s2">positive for us and the place where we</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.100" end="00:54:55.570" style="s2">part company if you&#39;re on the right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.710" end="00:54:57.070" style="s2">have those characteristics the place</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.570" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">where we actually differ over what</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.070" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">should happen next is far down the road</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:03.640" style="s2">so let&#39;s get there let&#39;s put the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:05.290" style="s2">patriotism first let&#39;s get somebody</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.640" end="00:55:08.230" style="s2">who&#39;s clever enough to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.290" end="00:55:11.560" style="s2">difficult this puzzle is into the office</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.230" end="00:55:15.880" style="s2">and let&#39;s give them give them some some</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.560" end="00:55:17.349" style="s2">leash two questions could you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.880" end="00:55:19.030" style="s2">your female coyness theory from</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.349" end="00:55:22.210" style="s2">evolution perspective</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.030" end="00:55:24.280" style="s2">let me just asterisk that and say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.210" end="00:55:25.660" style="s2">not really ours but we can talk more</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.280" end="00:55:27.010" style="s2">about that but maybe we should save that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.660" end="00:55:30.490" style="s2">in front of the time because I&#39;m sure it</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.010" end="00:55:32.380" style="s2">will come up frequently and when do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.490" end="00:55:36.869" style="s2">plan to share your male gayness theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.380" end="00:55:40.150" style="s2">Bret um that&#39;s a good question you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.869" end="00:55:45.070" style="s2">yeah back in the day which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.150" end="00:55:48.869" style="s2">months ago I was inclined to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.070" end="00:55:50.740" style="s2">how to rent a hall and deploy that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.869" end="00:55:54.670" style="s2">hypothesis so that people could</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.740" end="00:55:57.099" style="s2">entertain it and evaluate it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.670" end="00:55:59.980" style="s2">upload it later for viewing sure of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.099" end="00:56:01.869" style="s2">course of course problem is renting a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.980" end="00:56:05.349" style="s2">hall does that still exist is that a</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.869" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">thing yeah but it will again it will it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.349" end="00:56:11.140" style="s2">will so you say this is the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:12.940" style="s2">I wanted to talk about whether this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:14.770" style="s2">across an event horizon is there are all</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.940" end="00:56:16.060" style="s2">sorts of things which seem like of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.770" end="00:56:18.940" style="s2">course they will return and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.060" end="00:56:20.830" style="s2">sense they will return at some level but</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.940" end="00:56:22.330" style="s2">I also wonder if we look longer out</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.830" end="00:56:24.099" style="s2">whether some of these things are just</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.330" end="00:56:28.089" style="s2">finished some of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.099" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">finished but people saying people never</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.089" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">sit in restaurants again or go to live</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.810" style="s2">theater I say you haven&#39;t met people</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:39.070" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s those things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.810" end="00:56:40.839" style="s2">over yeah they&#39;re not over on the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.070" end="00:56:41.349" style="s2">hand I gotta tell you I don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.839" end="00:56:43.589" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.349" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how restaurants are safe</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.589" end="00:56:53.560" style="s2">yep right they can&#39;t be safe if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:55.000" style="s2">who coughs into a bowl of salad a big</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.560" end="00:56:56.830" style="s2">bowl of salad they&#39;ve made for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.000" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">restaurant can&#39;t throw it out because</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.830" end="00:57:04.810" style="s2">they&#39;ll get fired so you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:07.240" style="s2">decreased salad consumption considerably</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.810" end="00:57:11.590" style="s2">more for me yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.240" end="00:57:14.920" style="s2">a I don&#39;t know if this is a link I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.590" end="00:57:17.770" style="s2">quite tell not as not a question</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.920" end="00:57:20.560" style="s2">Co but 19 lockdown risks 14 million</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.770" end="00:57:23.800" style="s2">extra tuberculosis deaths study that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.560" end="00:57:26.770" style="s2">number seems like it couldn&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.800" end="00:57:29.550" style="s2">be true but clearly there&#39;s a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.770" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">in here with regard to a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.550" end="00:57:35.470" style="s2">risking a lot of TB deaths I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:37.300" style="s2">what the relationship is as premier is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.470" end="00:57:39.070" style="s2">clearly asking us to investigate it I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.300" end="00:57:41.550" style="s2">think we need to see more before we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.070" end="00:57:43.540" style="s2">be expected to go hunting for this I</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.550" end="00:57:44.800" style="s2">often have to keep a dictionary next to</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.540" end="00:57:47.650" style="s2">me during these but I love feeding my</p>

<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:14.500" style="s2">would have something to go with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.760" end="00:58:17.530" style="s2">amazing brisket from last night when we</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.500" end="00:58:19.840" style="s2">when we get off here he sometimes goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.530" end="00:58:21.460" style="s2">on an electric unicycle ride he no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.840" end="00:58:23.800" style="s2">plays with the menagerie that we have</p>

<p begin="00:58:33.640" end="00:58:37.000" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how do we manage and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.830" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">limit screen time and various devices</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.000" end="00:58:44.109" style="s2">for our kids this this again is probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:46.540" style="s2">a whole a whole hours or more topic but</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.109" end="00:58:51.310" style="s2">in some ways you know neither of our</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.540" end="00:58:54.250" style="s2">kids had we didn&#39;t put we didn&#39;t enforce</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.310" end="00:58:56.410" style="s2">hard and fast rules we tried to model</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.250" end="00:58:59.830" style="s2">behavior that seemed right and kept them</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.410" end="00:59:01.540" style="s2">from access neither them had smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.830" end="00:59:03.340" style="s2">actually until he moved here so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.540" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">would have been or not even smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.340" end="00:59:08.200" style="s2">at that fobian Toby hates it isn&#39;t when</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:10.090" style="s2">I have a phone at all still but our</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.200" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">feeling is we live in a city now you got</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.090" end="00:59:13.180" style="s2">to have one in case we need to get in</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:15.670" style="s2">touch with you you need to get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.180" end="00:59:17.530" style="s2">with us so you know everyone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.670" end="00:59:19.630" style="s2">screens now all of us have screens we</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.530" end="00:59:24.430" style="s2">live among way too many screens</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.630" end="00:59:27.810" style="s2">but yeah I would say you know we a we</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.430" end="00:59:32.800" style="s2">delayed contact with things longer than</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.810" end="00:59:37.480" style="s2">almost anybody we know when we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.800" end="00:59:40.330" style="s2">granted contact we have tried to shape</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.480" end="00:59:43.360" style="s2">that contact in a good direction so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.330" end="00:59:45.790" style="s2">know our kids do watch some television</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.360" end="00:59:47.380" style="s2">now but it&#39;s all with us things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.790" end="00:59:49.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve chosen that we think they oughta</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.380" end="00:59:51.700" style="s2">see sometimes we may not choose</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.930" end="00:59:53.590" style="s2">perfectly we know we&#39;re not used</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.700" end="00:59:56.140" style="s2">perfectly in fact in this case with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.590" end="01:00:00.310" style="s2">lockdown you know with the kids sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.140" end="01:00:02.980" style="s2">coming of age we showed them risky</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.310" end="01:00:03.820" style="s2">business so they&#39;re now both men because</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.980" end="01:00:05.500" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.820" end="01:00:08.860" style="s2">yes yeah that&#39;s how it works that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.500" end="01:00:12.220" style="s2">it works now but in any case yeah we try</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.860" end="01:00:14.200" style="s2">to shape their their encounters with</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.220" end="01:00:15.700" style="s2">this stuff and then we spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.200" end="01:00:17.500" style="s2">time talking about what it means in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.700" end="01:00:19.750" style="s2">hazards I guess I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.500" end="01:00:21.250" style="s2">big thing and you know we we we have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.750" end="01:00:23.890" style="s2">lot to say about this and also about</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.250" end="01:00:27.160" style="s2">parenting and childhood more generally</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.890" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">but we&#39;ve been I believe we actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.160" end="01:00:31.750" style="s2">came to understand not too many years</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.700" style="s2">ago that you and I both had</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.750" end="01:00:37.090" style="s2">independently without ever talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.700" end="01:00:39.580" style="s2">it only not talked about one subject</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.090" end="01:00:41.170" style="s2">with our children and we were otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.580" end="01:00:42.820" style="s2">I mean you mentioned earlier sex drugs</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:40.659" style="s2">guess I should rather than leave that as</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.049" end="01:01:42.519" style="s2">a something for people to wonder about</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.659" end="01:01:45.449" style="s2">the one topic that we both avoided</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.519" end="01:01:48.309" style="s2">talking about with them until they were</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.449" end="01:01:49.869" style="s2">until very recently I was suicide</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.309" end="01:01:52.779" style="s2">yep but neither of us thought it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.869" end="01:01:54.429" style="s2">wise to introduce that as a concept that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.779" end="01:01:56.709" style="s2">they should even have in their heads</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.429" end="01:01:59.199" style="s2">until they were a little bit older and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.709" end="01:02:02.619" style="s2">they&#39;re now they&#39;ve just last month they</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.489" end="01:02:33.640" style="s2">theory take it away you know I thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.380" end="01:02:35.619" style="s2">you were gonna bring this up when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.640" end="01:02:38.229" style="s2">started talking about other returns to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.619" end="01:02:40.689" style="s2">sea but it would have been tug and chic</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.229" end="01:02:43.449" style="s2">because neither of us think so with this</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.689" end="01:02:45.399" style="s2">you and I both I know I did always</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.449" end="01:02:46.779" style="s2">whenever I was teaching for it about</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.399" end="01:02:47.919" style="s2">evolution at least and sometimes and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.779" end="01:02:50.709" style="s2">was doing a little behavior or some</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.919" end="01:02:53.349" style="s2">other topics and students got to choose</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.709" end="01:02:54.609" style="s2">their own research topics for for</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.349" end="01:02:56.939" style="s2">literature review papers rather than</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.609" end="01:02:59.909" style="s2">empirical research which we also did</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.939" end="01:03:04.089" style="s2">often someone would research the aquatic</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.909" end="01:03:07.539" style="s2">hypothesis it it being more or less that</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.539" end="01:03:11.439" style="s2">different at the point that humans were</p>

<p begin="01:03:11.439" end="01:03:16.539" style="s2">no it did and that we were basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:18.249" style="s2">waiting around being somewhat aquatic</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.539" end="01:03:20.289" style="s2">and that this explains a number of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.249" end="01:03:24.039" style="s2">current anatomical physiological and no</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.289" end="01:03:24.939" style="s2">doubt cultural features and it&#39;s silly I</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.039" end="01:03:27.130" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy it</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.939" end="01:03:33.630" style="s2">you know I sort of mirrors actually it</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.130" end="01:03:36.749" style="s2">mirrors exactly this story yes the Bears</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.630" end="01:03:39.339" style="s2">fishing about in the shallow Tethys sea</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.749" end="01:03:40.899" style="s2">the more aquatic they became the more</p>

<p begin="01:03:40.899" end="01:03:44.380" style="s2">yada so anyway we get the argument it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:45.489" style="s2">not like the argument doesn&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.380" end="01:03:47.140" style="s2">we just don&#39;t think the evidence</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.489" end="01:03:53.470" style="s2">suggests that that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.140" end="01:03:56.170" style="s2">to humans greatness from Peru hey hola</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.470" end="01:03:58.660" style="s2">are you familiar with Martin no ox no</p>

<p begin="01:04:02.170" end="01:04:06.700" style="s2">this I did not know think they ever</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.240" end="01:04:21.970" style="s2">question yeah Wow and Slartibartfast the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.650" end="01:04:27.640" style="s2">best to know I didn&#39;t know that Nowak</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.970" end="01:04:29.980" style="s2">had been fired I&#39;m not a fan of the work</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.640" end="01:04:32.200" style="s2">that would have no AK and Wilson</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.980" end="01:04:33.910" style="s2">overlapping I think they&#39;ve both made an</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.200" end="01:04:36.700" style="s2">error I had a conversation with Nowak</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.910" end="01:04:40.570" style="s2">about this he&#39;s actually pretty nice guy</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.700" end="01:04:42.730" style="s2">but nonetheless I don&#39;t think the group</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.570" end="01:04:44.290" style="s2">selection is know where they are and how</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.730" end="01:04:46.420" style="s2">they ended up there I think they have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.290" end="01:04:50.100" style="s2">piece of the puzzle right but they have</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.420" end="01:04:53.230" style="s2">a mechanism that isn&#39;t right and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.100" end="01:04:55.330" style="s2">they have talked themselves into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.230" end="01:04:57.070" style="s2">corner so anyway this is the group</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.330" end="01:04:58.810" style="s2">selection discussion it does have to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.070" end="01:05:00.520" style="s2">sorted out I do think that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.810" end="01:05:03.160" style="s2">answer that&#39;s fairly straightforward and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.520" end="01:05:05.590" style="s2">is fully satisfying stay tuned okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.160" end="01:05:07.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve got three more questions two of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.590" end="01:05:09.180" style="s2">which are just comments so we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.810" end="01:05:11.560" style="s2">through these and then we&#39;ll sign off</p>

<p begin="01:05:16.870" end="01:05:19.900" style="s2">we want</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.410" end="01:05:20.830" style="s2">we are shills for the status quo that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.900" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">what we&#39;re hoping for</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.830" end="01:05:27.010" style="s2">look I actually I hear I hear this</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:29.320" style="s2">person the guy yeah yep I hear you Scott</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.010" end="01:05:31.750" style="s2">I really do and you know Heather will</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.320" end="01:05:34.510" style="s2">back me up on this the night that Trump</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.750" end="01:05:37.180" style="s2">was elected I told her he could be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.510" end="01:05:39.790" style="s2">greatest president in history and he has</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.180" end="01:05:42.460" style="s2">disappointed me primarily because he</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.790" end="01:05:44.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t decide to do it I would have been</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.460" end="01:05:47.890" style="s2">thrilled actually if he was willing</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.880" end="01:05:50.080" style="s2">having done the impossible which was get</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.890" end="01:05:52.270" style="s2">elected in that environment having done</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.080" end="01:05:53.650" style="s2">the impossible if he had stepped up to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.270" end="01:05:54.820" style="s2">the plate and said you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.650" end="01:05:56.890" style="s2">gonna be the greatest president in</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.820" end="01:05:59.440" style="s2">history I would have been there to back</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.890" end="01:06:00.490" style="s2">him but I mean this is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.440" end="01:06:02.830" style="s2">were just saying with her</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.490" end="01:06:04.780" style="s2">- his response right now right like he</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.830" end="01:06:07.570" style="s2">he had just been handed a victory that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.780" end="01:06:11.080" style="s2">no one maybe not even hey he expected</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.570" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">and this he didn&#39;t expect he didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.080" end="01:06:15.160" style="s2">he has no idea what to do etc but in</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:18.730" style="s2">both cases he could have been behaving</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.160" end="01:06:20.680" style="s2">in some way that&#39;s so stymied</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.730" end="01:06:25.350" style="s2">expectations in the status quo that he</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.680" end="01:06:27.670" style="s2">could actually have broken a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.350" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2">entrenched systems that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.670" end="01:06:34.840" style="s2">breaking the rest of us yeah so Scott</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:37.630" style="s2">let me just say he did the impossible</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.840" end="01:06:39.280" style="s2">I think he deserves credit for having</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.630" end="01:06:43.330" style="s2">done the impossible he broke through the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.280" end="01:06:46.869" style="s2">duopoly having broken through the de la</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.330" end="01:06:49.240" style="s2">pelea his fatal flaw is that he cannot</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.869" end="01:06:53.020" style="s2">step out of the political modality that</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.240" end="01:06:56.500" style="s2">allowed him to do it and this is not</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.020" end="01:06:59.800" style="s2">personal he can&#39;t be in that office any</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.500" end="01:07:01.810" style="s2">longer why because the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.800" end="01:07:05.170" style="s2">are playing with are so volatile so</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.810" end="01:07:07.180" style="s2">dangerous that we need somebody who is</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.170" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">capable of putting their own interests</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.180" end="01:07:10.690" style="s2">aside and it was his inability to put</p>
