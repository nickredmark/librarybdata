<p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">interesting and amazing characters in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a woman who for Alton&#39;s purposes</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:29.060" style="s2">is like a really wonderful woman she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">fighting the abolition of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.060" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">fighting for the abolition of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">and sees that as inhumane even though</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.369" style="s2">workers some slave plantations and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:47.720" style="s2">she&#39;s fighting against the children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.369" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">rights and it&#39;s just a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.720" end="00:01:53.240" style="s2">the Union if there&#39;s the forming unions</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:58.790" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to fight for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.240" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">12-hour workday just like there and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.790" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">their pie-in-the-sky ID is a 10-hour</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">workday and in still six days a week I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been asking to have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">have Saturday&#39;s off as well to think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:15.209" style="s2">ever a human history that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">at all of us at one point lived like in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.209" end="00:02:21.480" style="s2">a tribal scenario right lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:24.180" style="s2">tribal community where together as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">community we managed to get our food and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.180" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">get our needs met back when we all were</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">like the vast majority of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">population was tribal we clearly didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">have the technology innovation we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">and then that technology innovation a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:45.660" style="s2">lot of that was war war and how to mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">things and how to create innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.660" end="00:02:51.720" style="s2">then you think about like London and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">Europe there&#39;s a point where they</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.720" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">absolutely can&#39;t be tribal right like</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">they until you have agriculture you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:03:01.140" style="s2">can&#39;t have a massive population once you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">have a massive population then you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">to do things like make trapping illegal</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">and hunting anything that&#39;s that&#39;s wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">illegal as well as just cultivating food</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">on public or in other people&#39;s private</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">lands unless you&#39;re paying for it well</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">interesting this woman specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">she&#39;s a very kind woman who is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">do good and in the very first episode</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:27.739" style="s2">rather soon in a boy hurts his hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:30.569" style="s2">rather severely it gets amputated and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.739" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">they look after him until he pisses them</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.569" end="00:03:35.579" style="s2">off then he ends up being on the street</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s just because even in that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.579" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">they&#39;re doing him a favor by looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">after them even though they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">doing themselves a favor because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:43.430" style="s2">want the mill will look bad they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">no we look after the kids in our care</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.430" end="00:03:49.079" style="s2">see the point of it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:53.579" style="s2">point in history where slavery is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.079" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">starting to be looked at in in Britain</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">as wrong and can&#39;t be here and at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">same time there&#39;s a point where because</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.030" end="00:04:04.950" style="s2">they have all of the apprentices that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.900" style="s2">are children that get signed on when</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.950" end="00:04:09.299" style="s2">they&#39;re nine ten eleven and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.900" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">work for free until their 21st birthday</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.299" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">they lie about some of their ages that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">they get extra euros out of that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">like your 21st birthday you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">an indentured servant until that day but</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">they feed you and house you and you work</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">12-hour days and you get punished and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">you have to work overtime and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:32.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a point where they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.750" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">realize basically that it costs them</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.530" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">more to have the interns the children</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:42.699" style="s2">that they have to pay that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:46.539" style="s2">feed and clothe and house and basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.699" end="00:04:48.970" style="s2">health care and education to become like</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.539" end="00:04:50.919" style="s2">it&#39;s actually cheaper of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.970" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">cheaper enough slaves but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.919" end="00:04:55.539" style="s2">cheaper to employ people who then have</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:59.139" style="s2">to go out and spend money on food and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.539" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">clothing and shelter and like they end</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.139" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">up blaming all the boys go one point in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">time say relights the girls are better</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:07.750" style="s2">at the working and there is but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">forming unions and they&#39;re doing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.750" end="00:05:13.990" style="s2">trying to fight for having less time</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:17.380" style="s2">during the week devoted to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.990" end="00:05:20.259" style="s2">else&#39;s career and that that was ten hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.380" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">days was seen as very lofty and that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.259" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">for just the children</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:26.229" style="s2">the irony of this woman who&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:30.430" style="s2">what do you mean and there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.229" end="00:05:33.490" style="s2">where these immigrant family a family</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.430" end="00:05:35.469" style="s2">comes from a place where there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.490" end="00:05:41.789" style="s2">a family I think it&#39;s like Ireland or</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.469" end="00:05:45.090" style="s2">Scotland and they have he hasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.789" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">he&#39;s on the side of the factory owners</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.090" end="00:05:49.810" style="s2">he&#39;s very much we&#39;re not gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">charity we&#39;re here to to work our asses</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.810" end="00:05:53.560" style="s2">off is to he lies that one of his sons</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:56.349" style="s2">because they&#39;ve now fought for for</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.560" end="00:05:58.060" style="s2">children under 9 can&#39;t be in the factory</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.349" end="00:06:00.039" style="s2">and one of his sons is clearly under</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.060" end="00:06:01.389" style="s2">nine and he&#39;s like no I know my sons and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.039" end="00:06:03.250" style="s2">she&#39;s now nine and he has his sons</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.389" end="00:06:05.020" style="s2">working at the factory but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.250" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">and ever yet all the other England</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.020" end="00:06:08.139" style="s2">parents are like like they&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:09.759" style="s2">to have their kids not working factories</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.139" end="00:06:11.639" style="s2">twelve hours saying sorry how this kid</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.759" end="00:06:15.699" style="s2">working effective twelve hours a day and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.639" end="00:06:16.330" style="s2">a lot like you can see how when he was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.699" end="00:06:18.580" style="s2">farmer</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.330" end="00:06:20.590" style="s2">that makes complete sense when you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.580" end="00:06:21.819" style="s2">your children working on your farm with</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.590" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">you and they&#39;re right there and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.819" end="00:06:26.770" style="s2">learning in there that&#39;s much different</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">than handing your kid over either as</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:31.050" style="s2">they&#39;re still your kid but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.270" end="00:06:33.580" style="s2">working here and getting looked after or</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.050" end="00:06:35.529" style="s2">they get taken from the workhouse I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.580" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">still not a hundred percent sure never</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.400" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">quality it&#39;s not necessarily it&#39;s that</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.510" end="00:14:30.150" style="s2">break even as long as he has enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.130" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">money to live off of is to price it at</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.150" end="00:14:34.130" style="s2">the point where most people can afford</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:36.450" style="s2">it or it has the biggest impact and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.130" end="00:14:38.070" style="s2">under the I took a minor in economics</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.450" end="00:14:39.930" style="s2">earns a point where the graphs for</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.070" end="00:14:40.920" style="s2">demand and supply meet and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.930" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">you set it up because that&#39;s the highest</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.920" end="00:14:47.940" style="s2">profit point but if you sell at a lower</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">price point then you have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.940" end="00:14:58.380" style="s2">demand and you run a deficit like you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t even make that demand hurts</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.380" end="00:15:01.490" style="s2">the profit - isn&#39;t that what these</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:06.690" style="s2">graphs again and remember them but</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.490" end="00:15:09.020" style="s2">there&#39;s an equilibrium point of if if</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.690" end="00:15:11.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a million people who need this</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.020" end="00:15:15.780" style="s2">what is the question what am I trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.820" end="00:15:18.390" style="s2">say here there&#39;s a million people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.780" end="00:15:21.030" style="s2">absolutely need it and could pay 20</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.390" end="00:15:22.590" style="s2">bucks a month for it so if you were give</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.030" end="00:15:25.700" style="s2">if you were selling it to those people</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.590" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">you&#39;d be making twenty million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.700" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">if you do what you are currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:33.840" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re making twenty five million</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:35.300" style="s2">right you&#39;re selling them for a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.840" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">bucks a bottle</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.300" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">I just say $20 1 million instead you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">selling them for $100 and you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:54.350" style="s2">that&#39;s 25 million divided by 100 try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.310" end="00:15:56.420" style="s2">buy you something makes sense yeah 25</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.350" end="00:16:00.140" style="s2">Mille divided by hundred 9 not be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.420" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">to get my head right now ok 3 4 5 6 25</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.140" end="00:16:08.930" style="s2">million / hey meat see my q1y dubai on</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">how to it&#39;s just it&#39;s just take a beam</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.930" end="00:16:16.010" style="s2">off to zero so I got alright earning</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:17.720" style="s2">fifty thousand so instead you&#39;re a make</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.010" end="00:16:20.029" style="s2">it so if you&#39;re your business plan right</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.720" end="00:16:21.709" style="s2">now is that you are you have two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.029" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">fifty thousand customers who can afford</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.709" end="00:16:25.580" style="s2">a hundred dollars a month you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">25 million but you&#39;re only impacting and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.580" end="00:16:29.800" style="s2">helping two hundred and fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:32.180" style="s2">if you dropped your price point to 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.800" end="00:16:33.589" style="s2">because you make all this profit and now</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.180" end="00:16:35.690" style="s2">you&#39;re making a couple bucks of profit</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.589" end="00:16:38.180" style="s2">on everyone you&#39;re making and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.690" end="00:16:39.260" style="s2">net not grossest about example what</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:42.920" style="s2">these numbers that could make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.260" end="00:16:44.390" style="s2">but if you&#39;re instead selling for 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.920" end="00:16:47.029" style="s2">bucks and a million people can now buy</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.390" end="00:16:49.720" style="s2">it you your impact is four times greater</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.029" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">even though you&#39;re making less profit so</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.720" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">it makes sense to sell the drugs for</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:57.410" style="s2">Less monies they can have the highest</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:16:58.670" style="s2">impact if you&#39;re in it for the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:16:59.990" style="s2">right if you&#39;re in it so that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.670" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">can be at the highest mental capacity</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.990" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">its instead you&#39;re in it to serve your</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.949" style="s2">mission right that you&#39;re gonna save the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">starving kids you&#39;re gonna cure AIDS and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.949" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">cancer whatever you are your mission is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:14.030" style="s2">then you&#39;re in it to maximize profits so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:18.230" style="s2">you can maximize purpose in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.030" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">in your life those are very different</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.230" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2">goals and one makes me trust your</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:24.920" style="s2">company and one makes me trust you as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:27.110" style="s2">human being but then I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.920" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">trust your company right is Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.110" end="00:17:33.040" style="s2">creating vaccines to help sick kids or</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:37.070" style="s2">to make money those are very different</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.040" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">priorities and so if you&#39;re if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.070" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">together one single individual having</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">that power right deciding that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:43.669" style="s2">gonna be a philanthropist and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">gonna get all this money so they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.669" end="00:17:48.740" style="s2">dole it out who the are they like</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">why do they get to amass money</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.740" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">they can help help the world instead of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:52.970" style="s2">like just don&#39;t amass the money in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">you know if you were amassing it there</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:17:57.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be starving children except</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:00.470" style="s2">that of course that&#39;s not true one</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.860" end="00:18:02.210" style="s2">person amassing it isn&#39;t going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.470" end="00:18:04.070" style="s2">everyone from a mass so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.210" end="00:18:05.300" style="s2">there are people amassing it means that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.070" end="00:18:06.350" style="s2">they&#39;re starving people and some of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.300" end="00:18:07.400" style="s2">those people in that scene because</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.350" end="00:18:09.020" style="s2">they&#39;re like right if I&#39;m not the one</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.090" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">going to and there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:19.130" style="s2">broken in that model because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.830" style="s2">business owner is incentivized to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:25.040" style="s2">maximize profit which they then can pass</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.830" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">off as philanthropy but really what they</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.040" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">could do it just fix the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:29.090" style="s2">business right like an Amazon to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">actually help people they could make it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.090" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">so their workers are paid properly and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">we together as the consumer can find all</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.500" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">of these price points because the the</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">just spoiler alert they&#39;re never in it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:44.500" style="s2">for purpose they&#39;re always in it for</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.809" end="00:18:52.100" style="s2">it&#39;s in game a it has to be designed for</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:53.690" style="s2">profit or your why aren&#39;t you selling it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.100" end="00:18:56.929" style="s2">at the lower price points gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.690" end="00:18:58.429" style="s2">bigger impact if you can still be</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.929" end="00:19:00.800" style="s2">financially sustainable at that price</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.429" end="00:19:02.410" style="s2">point you&#39;re just making less profit</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.800" end="00:19:05.150" style="s2">right instead of having something</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:13.370" style="s2">not profit we do care about how much it</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.950" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">costs right I think when when the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.370" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">fast-food workers were fighting for $10</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.140" style="s2">$15 an hour and then fighting for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:23.540" style="s2">while he we never give it to them</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.140" end="00:21:25.670" style="s2">when you look at the actual cost to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.540" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">consumer so it costs 10 cents extra for</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.670" end="00:21:29.720" style="s2">burgers most people would be ok with</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.890" end="00:21:31.640" style="s2">them most people be ok with 10 cents</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.720" end="00:21:32.810" style="s2">extra in fact of fighting it the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.640" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">that all that now means then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.810" end="00:21:36.410" style="s2">probably only 15 25 cents burger they</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">need to make it look like it&#39;s expensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.410" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">so they&#39;re gonna rough it raisin $2 per</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:44.840" style="s2">burger they can see that it&#39;s ethical</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.460" end="00:21:48.260" style="s2">like there&#39;s all of this hidden politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.840" end="00:21:51.680" style="s2">and hidden that we can&#39;t react to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.260" end="00:21:56.060" style="s2">so anyway I&#39;m not the point we the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.680" end="00:21:58.670" style="s2">consumer seen transparently how the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.060" end="00:22:05.300" style="s2">price is created right if we created it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.670" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">$100 for this neuro drug only 250,000 of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.300" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">our members can make it can buy it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:12.140" style="s2">so it&#39;s only going to impact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">250,000 if we are able to create it at</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.140" end="00:22:16.260" style="s2">the million scale we can create it so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:17.880" style="s2">that we can solve it for 20</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.260" end="00:22:19.650" style="s2">do we have a million people who want it</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.880" end="00:22:22.350" style="s2">can we like is do we have enough demand</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.650" end="00:22:24.780" style="s2">to make that supply once we like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.350" end="00:22:26.370" style="s2">scale do we need to make this on so it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.780" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">brings the cost down further and further</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.370" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">and we&#39;re spreading it instead of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">all of the reward and then having even</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">have to be in the ecosystem in the</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:41.400" style="s2">lying and how do you know who is true</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.990" end="00:22:42.630" style="s2">and how do you know who Kenny oh who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.400" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">in there for purpose and how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.630" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">who&#39;s in there for profit they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.940" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">just you River Bravo we can just assume</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:50.130" style="s2">that but at the same time there are some</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">that are better some that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.130" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">less bad guys right I would trust Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:55.770" style="s2">Paul&#39;s product before I would trust any</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.930" style="s2">other ones on the market because I know</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.650" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">the same time I&#39;m not gonna buy from his</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.270" end="00:23:18.060" style="s2">neuro company because he&#39;s in there for</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:20.100" style="s2">you know it like he has to be there for</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.060" end="00:23:22.500" style="s2">profit and not for Pervez in order for</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.100" end="00:23:24.980" style="s2">his Jordan halls purpose to be there so</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.500" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">unless you&#39;re working in your purpose if</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.980" end="00:23:29.700" style="s2">you&#39;re if his job was actually neuro</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">enhancing drugs that was actually his</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.700" end="00:23:33.420" style="s2">calling on this planet then the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">would be to get the most impact out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.420" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">it and get the most right now the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:41.220" style="s2">people taking it if it&#39;s actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:42.570" style="s2">help your brain and have it so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.220" end="00:23:44.130" style="s2">not just the rich taking it cuz there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.570" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">also like classism involved like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.130" end="00:23:47.910" style="s2">rich get the best nutrition you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:49.800" style="s2">they get their brains enhance now they</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.910" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">get like if it&#39;s not effective I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.800" end="00:23:54.120" style="s2">want it and if it is effective actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:57.420" style="s2">have more of a problem it&#39;s like more of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.120" end="00:23:59.750" style="s2">a problem at the same time maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.420" end="00:24:01.920" style="s2">costs fifty five dollars to make it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.750" end="00:24:03.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s sold for sixty bucks a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.920" end="00:24:07.280" style="s2">month right so there&#39;s like no profit</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.630" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">there and this is where transparency</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.280" end="00:24:11.820" style="s2">hurts us because we can&#39;t tell profit</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:13.680" style="s2">versus purpose we can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.820" end="00:24:15.390" style="s2">here for profit or purpose unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.680" end="00:24:19.260" style="s2">transparent about your finances and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.390" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">where it comes from and together</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.260" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">the point is together if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:27.030" style="s2">needed neurological drugs we actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:29.400" style="s2">needed supplements we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.030" end="00:24:30.810" style="s2">science or rather our scientists</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.400" end="00:24:33.210" style="s2">that science and open it up to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.810" end="00:24:35.190" style="s2">of us and we can see yeah okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.210" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">want I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.190" end="00:24:39.660" style="s2">can probably read the ingredients list</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">but you know like we need say Cobalt</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.660" end="00:24:43.740" style="s2">something rather yeah that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:48.660" style="s2">not right whatever helps your brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.740" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">can&#39;t believe you go stuff that&#39;s bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.660" end="00:24:52.890" style="s2">don&#39;t help your brain and all these</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:56.310" style="s2">other other things we could manufacture</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.890" end="00:24:59.700" style="s2">a drug at the cost it takes to make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.310" end="00:25:02.010" style="s2">so if we have 250,000 people signing up</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.700" end="00:25:03.300" style="s2">for it we can offer the price of 50</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.010" end="00:25:05.340" style="s2">bucks a month if we have a million</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.300" end="00:25:07.020" style="s2">people it brings it down to 45 right</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.340" end="00:25:09.480" style="s2">like whatever those actual numbers are</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.620" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">accept um and then creating it for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.160" end="00:25:35.370" style="s2">amount like changing the economies of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:37.740" style="s2">scale so instead of being the risk-taker</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.370" end="00:25:39.660" style="s2">and having to figure out how much do I</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.740" end="00:25:42.450" style="s2">need to make and what do I need to sell</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.660" end="00:25:43.950" style="s2">it out smocks maximize my profit said of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.450" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">like literally asking people because</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:54.540" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re making so would you buy</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.800" end="00:25:57.210" style="s2">this at $100 an hour would you buy it at</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.540" end="00:25:58.470" style="s2">$20 an hour there is a lot of human</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.210" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">psychology that like there are people</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.470" end="00:26:02.790" style="s2">who will buy something at $100 an hour</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">who will not buy it at $20 an hour but</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.790" end="00:26:05.970" style="s2">that&#39;s because they think the hundred</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.970" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">comes with prestige those aren&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">if we have open science and open</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:16.560" style="s2">information and you can see that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.360" style="s2">the same quality why would you pay the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.560" end="00:26:19.590" style="s2">hundred over the twenty unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.360" end="00:26:22.410" style="s2">actually a reason like this one&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.590" end="00:26:25.110" style="s2">higher like the hundred dollars goes to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.410" end="00:26:26.430" style="s2">more people you know there isn&#39;t a why</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.110" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">would you choose why would you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.430" end="00:26:31.680" style="s2">Andrew dollars but together we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:34.290" style="s2">choose to make things ethically and make</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.680" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">things like if you think about a workers</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.290" end="00:26:41.040" style="s2">cooperative Jordans example right of his</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">company a workers coop if he handed it</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.370" end="00:26:50.679" style="s2">know what I mean it&#39;s still priced</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.269" end="00:26:51.970" style="s2">higher than most people can afford it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.679" end="00:26:53.140" style="s2">it&#39;s just that yes the workers are</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.970" end="00:26:54.399" style="s2">getting compensated more instead of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.140" end="00:26:57.100" style="s2">profit going to Jordans and he can</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.309" end="00:28:42.789" style="s2">the pink text right like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.779" end="00:28:44.350" style="s2">pink attacks it&#39;s like yes this is how</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.789" end="00:28:46.419" style="s2">much it cost to make this one is so much</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.350" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">it cost to make this one it might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.419" end="00:28:49.990" style="s2">that one of them costs more and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:52.899" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s more expensive or we</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.990" end="00:28:54.789" style="s2">might decide that it&#39;s who cares whether</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.480" end="00:28:59.260" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be the same price so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">gonna price it out across the people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.260" end="00:29:03.550" style="s2">buy it but you know it would only make</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.740" style="s2">ten percent of female and ninety percent</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.550" end="00:29:07.630" style="s2">are male and the ninety percent so when</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.740" end="00:29:09.460" style="s2">they cost smart that buy it might not</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.630" end="00:29:11.320" style="s2">make sense and the women be like were</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">the females we like weirdos will go off</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.330" end="00:29:29.130" style="s2">reason you&#39;re not is it disperses the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.130" end="00:29:32.170" style="s2">energy so if someone starts a competing</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.130" end="00:29:33.700" style="s2">entity you want them to come on board</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.820" end="00:31:33.490" style="s2">need to be asked right like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.860" end="00:31:35.080" style="s2">actually increase the customer base so</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.490" end="00:31:38.800" style="s2">that it brings the cost down and we can</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.800" end="00:31:42.460" style="s2">create them on scale and create them</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.360" end="00:31:44.920" style="s2">ethically we still care about workers we</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.580" end="00:32:06.460" style="s2">externalities on to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2">world so you don&#39;t have the choice of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.460" end="00:32:10.660" style="s2">shopping at Walmart after a while</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:12.280" style="s2">because you can see that when you shop</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.660" end="00:32:14.380" style="s2">at Walmart what you&#39;re actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.280" end="00:32:15.910" style="s2">stealing what you&#39;re actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.380" end="00:32:17.350" style="s2">stealing from all of the people working</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.910" end="00:32:19.480" style="s2">in the factories and all of the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.350" end="00:32:20.830" style="s2">generations and all of and you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.480" end="00:32:23.260" style="s2">that money to the shareholders of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.830" end="00:32:25.870" style="s2">Walmart who I think have enough I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.260" end="00:32:27.490" style="s2">that family has enough money but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.870" end="00:32:30.910" style="s2">not really an option when you&#39;re poor</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.490" end="00:32:32.500" style="s2">like right now it pays to be ignorant to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.910" end="00:32:34.540" style="s2">what the cost is to shop at Walmart and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.500" end="00:32:36.370" style="s2">it&#39;s your only option but when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.540" end="00:32:39.010" style="s2">actually have other options and you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.370" end="00:32:41.800" style="s2">say okay I&#39;m gonna buy this mug for five</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.010" end="00:32:44.140" style="s2">bucks at Walmart versus I can create</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.800" end="00:32:46.120" style="s2">that mug myself we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.140" end="00:32:51.220" style="s2">mass-produce it together and it will</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.120" end="00:32:55.240" style="s2">also be $5 but I can see that that money</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.220" end="00:32:55.810" style="s2">went to the supply chain instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.240" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">Waltons</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.810" end="00:33:00.370" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the Waltons since I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:04.330" style="s2">the Walton family people who owned</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.370" end="00:33:06.400" style="s2">Walmart and we can create things better</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.330" end="00:33:09.550" style="s2">like right now and this is where in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.400" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">mills and the workers to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.550" end="00:33:14.440" style="s2">it used to be illegal to organize</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:16.180" style="s2">workers because they knew these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:17.170" style="s2">could happen right if the workers are</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.180" end="00:33:19.780" style="s2">talking and they know how much money</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.170" end="00:33:21.160" style="s2">they&#39;re making then they can fight to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.780" end="00:33:22.610" style="s2">have the same amount of money they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.160" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">fight or</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.610" end="00:33:26.270" style="s2">or if they know how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:29.240" style="s2">dying and getting and getting permanent</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.270" end="00:33:31.210" style="s2">injuries then they&#39;re gonna be more like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.240" end="00:33:33.470" style="s2">able to fight right</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.210" end="00:33:34.910" style="s2">everything&#39;s dividing conquer in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.470" end="00:33:37.790" style="s2">society the more we&#39;re divided the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.910" end="00:33:39.830" style="s2">easier it is to to have power over us</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.790" end="00:33:41.299" style="s2">the more were together the less easy it</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.830" end="00:33:43.820" style="s2">is to have power over us except for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.299" end="00:33:45.559" style="s2">togetherness right so if in being</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.820" end="00:33:48.770" style="s2">together that togetherness has power</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.559" end="00:33:49.970" style="s2">over you at least it&#39;s voluntary and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.770" end="00:33:51.320" style="s2">can design it in a way it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.970" end="00:33:53.179" style="s2">power over you because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.320" end="00:33:54.770" style="s2">anything ever to have power over me so</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.179" end="00:33:57.350" style="s2">anything I design is designed to not</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.770" end="00:33:59.210" style="s2">have power over the individual but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.350" end="00:34:01.309" style="s2">one person so if other people really</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.210" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">want essential energy to have power over</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.309" end="00:34:09.409" style="s2">them then I guess we&#39;ll create it that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.280" end="00:34:11.780" style="s2">way creating the system that can bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.409" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">users together to create solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.780" end="00:34:16.310" style="s2">they then can all be part of is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:17.510" style="s2">solution raises is doing and focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.310" end="00:34:19.129" style="s2">it from that side right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.510" end="00:34:21.050" style="s2">creating a pass to companies so that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.129" end="00:34:24.260" style="s2">can all be millionaires and sell it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.050" end="00:34:25.879" style="s2">a gross margin to everybody else we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.260" end="00:34:27.649" style="s2">creating a past and we&#39;re not created</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.879" end="00:34:29.899" style="s2">right now but it we&#39;re recruiting a past</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.649" end="00:34:32.810" style="s2">a company cuz we like pasta and we want</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.899" end="00:34:34.700" style="s2">good quality ethical pasta for as cheap</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.810" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2">as possible as chief thrusts in labor</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.700" end="00:34:38.810" style="s2">and Rihanna&#39;s cheapest in resources and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:40.909" style="s2">actually cheap in externalities passed</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.810" end="00:34:43.850" style="s2">on to everyone else thirdly no extra a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.909" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">letís past times everyone else and so it</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.850" end="00:34:50.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to compete with that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:52.909" style="s2">in fact a pasta company that&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.210" end="00:34:54.379" style="s2">for the people with the people puts all</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.909" end="00:34:57.109" style="s2">the other for-profit ones out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.379" end="00:34:59.210" style="s2">business eventually because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.109" end="00:35:01.340" style="s2">where the incentives are you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.210" end="00:35:03.770" style="s2">compete with your for-profit one with</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.340" end="00:35:04.430" style="s2">our not-for-profit one yours is owned by</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.770" end="00:35:07.070" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.430" end="00:35:10.040" style="s2">art is owned by us like why if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.070" end="00:35:12.650" style="s2">the person who owns it the Walton family</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.040" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">might still shop at Walmart Walmart</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.650" end="00:35:18.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist if just the Walton family</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:22.359" style="s2">shops there ain&#39;t going clean just some</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.170" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">shop all parts and so it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.359" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">seizing the means of production or like</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.060" style="s2">taking over somebody else&#39;s property the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:33.740" style="s2">Walton family owns Walmart we&#39;re never</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.120" end="00:35:41.400" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna just give it up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.470" end="00:35:43.350" style="s2">humanity they&#39;re not but any of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.400" end="00:35:45.870" style="s2">big mammoth companies like right now the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.350" end="00:35:47.220" style="s2">solution that I see that people promote</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.870" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">is to go back to the old days it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.220" end="00:35:51.180" style="s2">to have worker coops to have like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:55.620" style="s2">come together and fight the government</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.180" end="00:35:57.900" style="s2">fight the big 1% which on one level on</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.620" end="00:35:59.550" style="s2">four but on another level it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.900" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2"> work so why are we doing it like</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.550" end="00:36:04.890" style="s2">like it&#39;s so much energy fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.950" end="00:36:07.230" style="s2">Goliath as David like it just is too</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.890" end="00:36:11.010" style="s2">much it&#39;s like what the Bible says he</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.230" end="00:36:12.660" style="s2">did win yes it was hard so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.010" end="00:36:13.620" style="s2">we don&#39;t maybe we don&#39;t even have God on</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.340" end="00:37:26.790" style="s2">because it&#39;s convenient because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.050" end="00:37:29.130" style="s2">convenient so basically the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.790" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">things get brought to us right because</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.130" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not that cheap you can separate</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.940" end="00:37:42.660" style="s2">there&#39;s all the negative that it cost</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.920" end="00:37:44.850" style="s2">the environment a lot their packaging</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.660" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">and transportation is not efficient it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.850" end="00:37:50.280" style="s2">gets to you fast but it&#39;s not efficient</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:52.140" style="s2">their workers are sick and possibly</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.610" end="00:38:05.130" style="s2">out we can create a system that that is</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.130" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s picked up for one person and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.270" end="00:38:09.390" style="s2">brought to another and figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.430" style="s2">what is it we actually need and start</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.390" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">manufacturing those goods and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:16.830" style="s2">manufacturing they wait they showing</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.640" end="00:38:31.140" style="s2">was on we can do that ethically create</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.440" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">epic lee because every time we&#39;d steal</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.320" end="00:38:42.210" style="s2">stealing an idea if we know how much</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.390" end="00:38:44.070" style="s2">clothes people use and we can make them</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.210" end="00:38:45.840" style="s2">in a way that they want them right we</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.620" end="00:38:57.420" style="s2">it and have their permission to create</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.860" end="00:38:59.190" style="s2">something that they would use instead</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.420" end="00:39:01.170" style="s2">because they&#39;re fully involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.190" end="00:39:02.940" style="s2">process and a lot of since we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.170" end="00:39:04.200" style="s2">know what we want right I might want</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.940" end="00:39:05.280" style="s2">clothes like that and then they come</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.200" end="00:39:07.170" style="s2">they like actually I don&#39;t want clothes</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:08.790" style="s2">like that but it&#39;s your company so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.170" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">your risk there&#39;s no one to return it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.790" end="00:39:13.650" style="s2">right like you&#39;re involved in the this</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:15.210" style="s2">is the Wardrobe I want this is the food</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.650" end="00:39:15.660" style="s2">I want and then you order it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.210" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.660" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">and if it wasn&#39;t made properly then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:22.950" style="s2">have to deal with that as a company</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">right as as an entity why is our food</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.950" end="00:39:30.510" style="s2">full of holes why is our clothes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:33.270" style="s2">out in five months it under fast fashion</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.510" end="00:39:35.880" style="s2">for profit who cares</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.270" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">it makes them profit it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.880" end="00:39:38.730" style="s2">be in style in six months so does it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">matter if it breaks apart doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.730" end="00:39:44.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s destroyed our blood so that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:46.650" style="s2">can think we look pretty we can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.070" end="00:39:51.600" style="s2">clothes that are that are that last that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.650" end="00:39:53.430" style="s2">are our eternal style right like I know</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.600" end="00:39:55.620" style="s2">what I&#39;m probably never gonna wear again</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.430" end="00:39:56.970" style="s2">I know what I like and I could order it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.620" end="00:39:59.190" style="s2">multiple times right like a t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.970" end="00:40:01.080" style="s2">never goes out of style I can and why do</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.190" end="00:40:03.480" style="s2">things go to style but you actually are</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.080" end="00:40:04.150" style="s2">dressing for you then things don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.480" end="00:40:05.260" style="s2">out of style</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.150" end="00:40:06.940" style="s2">in style you might see something</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.260" end="00:40:08.470" style="s2">someone&#39;s very idea I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.940" end="00:40:10.180" style="s2">but things aren&#39;t made on a massive</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.470" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">scale and it changes every month it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.180" end="00:40:14.080" style="s2">just like that&#39;s not sustainable but</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">I&#39;ll let the fashionistas decide on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.080" end="00:40:17.380" style="s2">that should ease this can decide what</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">what they want and how to create it</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.380" end="00:40:23.770" style="s2">because if we can get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:25.690" style="s2">we have nearly a rehab this is the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.770" end="00:40:29.410" style="s2">I would say sustainable energy but like</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.690" end="00:40:31.120" style="s2">very efficient sustainable energy so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.410" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">can basically use all of it you can use</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.120" end="00:40:34.510" style="s2">as much of it as you want and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">materials are recycled ad infinitum</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.510" end="00:40:38.050" style="s2">right we can grow algae and print it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.060" style="s2">into cloth and cloth and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.050" end="00:40:41.950" style="s2">broken down and it&#39;s fed to the new</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.060" end="00:40:44.290" style="s2">island you get broken into cloth and by</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.950" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">all means print yourself a new wardrobe</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.290" end="00:40:48.520" style="s2">every day and wear it in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:50.680" style="s2">but when that&#39;s not the case and instead</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.520" end="00:40:51.790" style="s2">you&#39;re buying a four dollar shirts so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.680" end="00:40:53.020" style="s2">you could throw it out at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.790" end="00:40:57.930" style="s2">week is having read something sees you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.020" end="00:40:57.930" style="s2">in it twice it&#39;s a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.020" end="00:41:03.310" style="s2">conceptual framework that is generate</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.940" end="00:41:05.320" style="s2">answers but though sorry I&#39;m sending</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.310" end="00:41:07.180" style="s2">this up here&#39;s other people going to but</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.180" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">work better when they generate more and</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.030" end="00:41:33.550" style="s2">contradiction I&#39;m someone who likes to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.870" end="00:41:35.950" style="s2">create more and better questions but</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.550" end="00:41:43.630" style="s2">like I think I&#39;m like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.950" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">there but or sustainable questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.630" end="00:41:49.810" style="s2">no I mean that definitely helps he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">more sustainable questions work yes what</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.810" end="00:41:56.470" style="s2">are questions you like to ask that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.840" style="s2">what we&#39;re working on I mean with both</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.470" end="00:42:01.420" style="s2">solution or using and idea cafe every</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.840" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">idea cafe is around a question and just</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.420" end="00:42:05.310" style="s2">generating them is half the battle</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:09.670" style="s2">those are there you have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.310" end="00:42:11.530" style="s2">but like I don&#39;t think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.670" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">generate the answer because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.530" end="00:42:16.420" style="s2">never the answer</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a system of how</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.420" end="00:42:20.350" style="s2">answer answer how to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.670" style="s2">solutions to questions and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.350" end="00:42:24.100" style="s2">have people who want to generate</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.670" end="00:42:26.110" style="s2">questions generate questions all day</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.100" end="00:42:28.390" style="s2">long and those that are good and want to</p>

<p begin="00:42:39.810" end="00:42:47.350" style="s2">definitely ponderer but the asking</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:48.490" style="s2">better questions is definitely a one of</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.490" end="00:42:53.620" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing as a plan I mean I just</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.320" end="00:42:56.110" style="s2">had someone the video I posted last week</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.620" end="00:42:57.490" style="s2">on Michael Moore&#39;s video he release</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.490" end="00:43:00.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite make sense because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.990" end="00:43:02.110" style="s2">both talked about old things from a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.550" end="00:43:04.840" style="s2">decade ago and talked about new things I</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.110" end="00:43:07.270" style="s2">don&#39;t it was released in 2019 but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.840" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">old information the people commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.270" end="00:43:09.970" style="s2">it someone was like well yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:11.650" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at the wrong technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.970" end="00:43:14.350" style="s2">and like what&#39;s the right technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.650" end="00:43:17.050" style="s2">like I agree what they looked at was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.350" end="00:43:20.470" style="s2">big basically oil producers now doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.050" end="00:43:21.670" style="s2">breeding green energy they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.470" end="00:43:23.470" style="s2">gonna do it right there and it for</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.670" end="00:43:25.060" style="s2">profit not for purpose if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.470" end="00:43:27.850" style="s2">transparent and open I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.060" end="00:43:29.170" style="s2">sustainable renewable energy it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.850" end="00:43:30.310" style="s2">not what our governments are gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:31.870" style="s2">their money into they&#39;re gonna put their</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.310" end="00:43:34.360" style="s2">money into their friends projects which</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.870" end="00:43:36.430" style="s2">probably aren&#39;t them greenness unless we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.360" end="00:43:37.870" style="s2">have and so this is like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.430" end="00:43:39.640" style="s2">wrong question everybody said the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.870" end="00:43:43.360" style="s2">question was it like no it&#39;s really not</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.640" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">the wrong question it&#39;s not it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.360" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">the right technology even if I like</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:49.570" style="s2">you&#39;re like well my cousin my cousin</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:51.820" style="s2">knows how to do solar or super</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.820" end="00:43:55.330" style="s2">that is the question like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.830" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">underlining of the question because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.330" end="00:43:58.450" style="s2">could ask how do I trust you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">know what you know but until there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.450" end="00:44:03.250" style="s2">system of trust a system of I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:05.260" style="s2">if he&#39;s your cousin I don&#39;t care if</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.500" end="00:44:18.190" style="s2">placebo or not and seeing if they work</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.510" end="00:44:20.050" style="s2">and and then testing them right for six</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.190" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">months years down the road is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.050" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2">placebo is it is it is it actually real</p>
