<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">um so i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">uh yeah maybe the first question is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">motivated you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">and david to write the original uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">monograph you wrote in in 1999 and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">this follow-up and then maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">come to terms with all the different</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">terms that are there like noah&#39;s fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">and no apolitique that people might not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">sure well david and i have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">to interpret the strategic implications</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">of the information age for the last 30</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">and just with regard to your</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">while i&#39;ve remained involved with rand</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually been at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">united states naval post graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">for the last 27 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">but my continued involvement with rand</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">and with david has been one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">privileges</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">in fact i like to say my best years at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">rand were since i left</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been thinking about this for</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">quite a while we developed a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">cyber war which</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">people probably have heard a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">about uh now</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">and we paid a great deal of attention to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">the rise of uh networks</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">and uh the way they would uh operate we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">came up with notions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">uh swarms and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">not just swarms of missiles and things</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">like that but also</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">social swarms the think of the color</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">the arab spring the sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">give power to social movements are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">really all about</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">networking and and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">as a kind of culminating a piece of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">that first arc of our research</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">we decided that uh military and defense</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">affairs</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">aside it was important to rethink</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">statecraft more generally</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">and so it occurred to us that a century</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">long before the world wide web or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">internet existed</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">tehar deshardan talked about this globe</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">girdling realm of the mind that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">was one day going to come into being</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">where all would connect with all and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">it would change</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">really the way the world operated and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">this made a great deal of sense to us we</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">began to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">find bits of evidence of movement in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">this direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">but what we realized at the time is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">traditional notions of force and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">statecraft power in general</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">have a doctrine associated with them the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">notion of rail politique</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">this is power politics economic pressure</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">military threats deterrence coercion</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">all those sorts of things there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">well articulated doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">for hard power little of that doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">works very well i hasten to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">but there isn&#39;t really a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">or acting</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">or really a set of concepts</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">for the use of softer ideational power</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">and so that&#39;s really what neopolitique</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">is all about how would one</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">take this notion of this globe</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">globe-girdling realm of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">and turn it into something that could uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">actually inform and guide policy</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">uh leave room for prosperity and peace</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">and make a world less permissive of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">kinds of conflicts we&#39;ve seen not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.280" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">the last few decades but</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">really in the 75 years since the end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">world war ii on average the world has</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">had over 30 wars ongoing at any given</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">there are about 40 going on today</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">and while we don&#39;t have things like</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">world war ii in terms of many tens of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">millions of lives lost</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">there are countries in which terrible</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">conflicts are underway in which the</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">is far far greater than suffered in</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.199" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">world war ii when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">the five million who died in the congo</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">the million in syria and of course half</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">on on and on and so we think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">plenty of room</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">especially because of the very failed</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">record of traditional rail politique</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">that there is room for this new approach</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll pause there to let you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">ruminate and ask another question</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">so uh when i first heard the term noise</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">here i</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">i loved it speaking out about i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">using it every time every moment i could</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s maybe what gravitated</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">me to reach out to your original uh book</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">that you released in 1999</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious why did you choose that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">particularly out of all the other terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">out there collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">and maybe you can speak on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">evolutionary um</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">aspect of it like the um the geosphere</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">to the biosphere to the new sphere</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">sure well nuos of course has the greek</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">roots of uh the mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">right and so a realm of the mind would</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">be a noise sphere and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">invent that that term tehar the chardan</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">was the one who really began it and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">the one</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">who saw the evolution of the planet in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">the geosphere it began as the hot rock</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">uh life came to it whether from you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">the comets dropping water on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">or natural condensation cooling</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">but geosphere went to biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">and now at this evolutionary stage we</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">have the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">of this realm of of the mind this newer</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">sphere</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">and uh again what what we noticed was</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">this lack of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">any notion of um how one would operate</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">in terms of state craft and diplomacy</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">in in the world where there was a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">sphere and i hastened to add that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">we aren&#39;t the first people to think or</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">nor was taylor</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">of this idea of the globe girdling</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">certainly emerson&#39;s oversoul</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">is an idea very consistent with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">and he&#39;s not the the only thinker but i</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">think we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">uh really taken original path here</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">by suggesting that this concept actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">implies a new way of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">with other nations and especially with</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">the rise of networks this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">i think truly the age of networks this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">is the information revolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">is most conducive to the formation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">flat organizational structures of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">drawn together</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">by a common goal without necessarily any</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">kind of central control</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">and as i look at evolution and i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">david does too</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">we see in the human experience at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">know of it historically empires were the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">units that drove human affairs</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">for millennia until probably around 1500</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">and in the last 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">the nation state began to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">that dominated it basically has crushed</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">the empires after</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">uh 500 years of of competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">now is the empire&#39;s if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">consider the soviet union the last of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">the empires or if you&#39;d like to consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">the united states as the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">empire as the empires have</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">faded away and the nation-states seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">dominant the networks have arisen to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">challenge them</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">with the zapatista movement in in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">1990s with campaigns to ban</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">land mines and nuclear testing and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">of other networked activities and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">see a world now</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">the world of empires and nations faded</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">away now it&#39;s a world</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">of nations and networks and it saddens</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">us to see how much conflict there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">between nations and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">and uh networks but that goes to uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">a point that you know we feel is is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">important to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">which is that this information</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">revolution can be used for good</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">or ill for light or for dark and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">that is something very much a matter in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">contention</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">uh right now peter and i want to double</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">click on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">the dark side in a moment uh but to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">to terms further</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">could you explain the difference for</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know the difference uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">between hard power</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">versus soft power and then maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">sharp power and deal power as you guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">pointed this one</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">and how that relates to uh no apology</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">sure hard power is very traditional</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">uh railpolitik it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">the size of your economy the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">traditionally the amount of steel</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">production your country had because that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">uh let you know how much you could make</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">in terms of weaponry the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">advance of your technology uh again for</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">uh usually for weapons making power</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">generally measured</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">in in that way economic military</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">to some extent people begin to pay</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">attention to the notion of informational</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">power through uh diplomacy</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">reputation matters by the way if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">watch the</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">uh the views of the united states have</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">gone down very</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">sharply and and that&#39;s even pre-coveted</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">and uh so it&#39;s it&#39;s troubling to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">that development</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">soft power is this notion of uh</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the notion of soft power seems to</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">in in soft power it can be used for very</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">very dark purposes such as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">really intervening in democratic</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s soft power too</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">and and so nuopolitique in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">our idea of it is really about</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">signs of this trying to poke its head up</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">above the surface in things like the</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">drowned out very much by</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">come up with this notion of deal power</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">uh because the current american</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">president seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">quite fixated on the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">as as well it implies a certain kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">uh etc and i think china is to some</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">sharp uh power so there&#39;s all this</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re not really interested in in</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">is fairly clear</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">what&#39;s not clear is that people need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">soft power ideational power can be used</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">for very very dark purposes</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">and one of the ideas behind our</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">is to take an ethical stand in</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">and we take heart looking at things like</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">politics among nations uh to see that he</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">uh the system simply won&#39;t work and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">for morgenthau there&#39;s this recognition</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">of the need for an ethical foundation</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">even to power politics what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">this isn&#39;t simply a foundation piece</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">this actually should be much more of the</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">will be uh diminishing over time and</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">from the use of hard power certainly as</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">the united states has seen over the last</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">what people don&#39;t generally hear about</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">is how often these techniques are being</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">uh deeply faked if not deep fakes</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">so we have to recognize</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">a less permissive environment for this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">by the establishment of sets of common</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">values and and here one of our central</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">is this notion of finding the issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">on which there can be general agreement</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">anti-genocide convention 1948</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">declarations of human rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">but we also see things like the global</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">the environment would be of course a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">part of this something on which people</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">come to agreement about uh protecting</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">other areas of the commons would be</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">right now there&#39;s an arms race emerging</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">of the outer space treaty of 1967 so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">this would be another</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">area where i think the global commons</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">and our attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">uh through a new political perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">would be uh very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">uh helpful and there are many other uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">areas</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">and i want to just say before we go to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">chat that david and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">have as much as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">you might say we have a kind of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">of the potential for a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">statecraft to emerge much as they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">and varnodsky and leroy had a century</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">we&#39;re also pretty flinty-eyed about how</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">to get there</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">and so another concept in our study that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">developed here and have been working on</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">is this idea of guarded openness it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">deliberately ambivalent</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">sort of formulation that suggests we</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">want to foster as much openness as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">but we want to remain as guarded as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">can also be</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">against the sorts of things like deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">fakes and electioneering</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">uh from the outside uh in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">liberal democratic processes and you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">think about it on a spectrum right where</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">where&#39;s the people&#39;s republic of china</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">incredibly guarded with some openness</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s allowed them to enjoy some</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">economic prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">but basically they&#39;ve tended to control</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">social uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">unrest the united states has defaulted</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">uh a lot more toward openness and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">frankly i don&#39;t think we&#39;re guarded in</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">the right ways we&#39;re regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">against the wrong sorts of of of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">uh and then the european union probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">a nice blend of guardedness</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">and openness the global data protection</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">established there i think is an</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">of both fostering openness while at the</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">uh substantially uh guarded so hold on</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">to that thought the global</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">commons guarded openness uh for us</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">at a policy level you know we&#39;re defense</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">and another thing that we thought was</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">very very important</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">was that nations especially in a world</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">in importance and we are forming</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">it&#39;s important for a nation to know its</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">we know and all the people we work with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">know exactly our military posture you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">know how many missiles we have</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">what is the not only the conduits that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">we have the voice of america and other</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">but what&#39;s the content we&#39;re putting out</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">there and is it consistent with our</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">actions an information posture needs to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">ask and ask answer questions of of that</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.840" style="s2">so uh i i know you probably want to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">to chat so i&#39;ll pass this back to you</p>

<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">chardin&#39;s a mega point but peter jones</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">has uh has that embedded in his question</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">so i will tag</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">i was uh curious about perhaps a</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">of the noah&#39;s sphere from um</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">from a concept of gl of arri</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">but a but a global consciousness and</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">all would be connected and and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">if you look at wired and</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">for a long time and and who is sort of</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">wired he very much is uh of this of this</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">as well and we think that especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">when when you consider and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">of the reasons we emphasize notions of</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">at stake and humanity needs to rise</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">or you know david and i spent most of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">our lives thinking about issues of war</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">and peace and security and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">i have to say the system that we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work very well there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">war it&#39;s too destructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">and the idea of going to war over</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">differing god</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">concepts or economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">seems increasingly absurd and i think we</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">now have the technology that will allow</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">for a discourse</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">that makes clear the bankruptcy</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">of these older concepts and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">for for all the different ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve contributed to the defense world</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">this view of neopolitique something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">will be a real operating doctrine for</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">the newest fear</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">i think is more important than any other</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">work that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">thank you i might add the other the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">other kind of proposal i had in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">was that this if that was a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">another spectrum that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">might conflict with it but also a line</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">would be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">would would be a political spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be left right to me it would</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">the the different gradations of from</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">local to global</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">including a nationalism which is a type</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">of somewhere in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t always bad you know john</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">ralston saul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">um had promoted a kind of positive view</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">of nationalism which we actually see in</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">canada</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">which is uh which is a movement away</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">from globalization</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">but is not necessarily away from you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">global participation global</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">and so i&#39;m starting to imagine from your</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">concept that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">that we could start to reposition um</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">the different you know and not to have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">manichaean view</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">of of national nationalism versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">globalism which has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">which are both pretty much hard-edged uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">real politic approaches i i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">a very wise point</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">the nation state is not going gentle</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">into that good night</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">and so it has to be brought into this</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">and i think you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">about countries like canada like sweden</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">and and some others uh that really are</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">understanding that there is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">possibility of a harmonious evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">nations and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">and networks and uh that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">counterpoise to those who would use the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">new technology to reassert forms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">so for example the social credit system</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">in china is an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">nationalist view where now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">you know you can get a negative score on</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">your social credit in china if a camera</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">picks you up jaywalking on a street</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:15.840" style="s2">in uh wuhan uh and and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">almost or orwellian and it&#39;s now as of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.840" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">this year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">mandatory for uh everybody and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">i i see uh alex warren has asked a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">question about his authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">winning</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">and and i&#39;d say it may not be winning</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly having its innings</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">and uh you know china has uh i was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">talking about their social credit system</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:39.320" style="s2">is clearly authoritarian or if we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">to get into definitions closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.320" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">totalitarian sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">initiative but hong kong looks pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">restive</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">i i think xinjiang is is a problem for</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">them it&#39;s really an open question as to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">how long china can continue to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">the economic and political benefits</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:01.039" style="s2">of the information revolution without</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">suffering the social consequences</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.039" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">and so yeah authoritarianism uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">is uh is going to be around and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">uh in in our view i think i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">for david here</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">we find it far less well attuned to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">potentialities of the information</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">age to the new sphere to neuropolitique</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">and that that eventually just as nation</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">states triumphed</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">over empires i think this more</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">interconnected network-like view even in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">the world in which nation-states persist</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">will much much more come to the fore uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">but i i think we&#39;re in for it even when</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">our colleague frank fukuyama wrote the</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">ones are</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">are the most interesting um my</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">a bit about that and how you&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">apply</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">yeah we have used that term and uh our</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">thinking about networks</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">and what makes for a healthy network and</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">necessarily a central control you must</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">have a story</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of our monograph here</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">we we think that narrative notion is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">uh important there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">a social sense that emerges in these</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">networks that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">certainly the nation has been a focus of</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">centuries now what if the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">loyalty is now</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:14.679" style="s2">a social one to those like-minded in</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">pursuit of something like you know an</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.679" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">anti-land mine campaign or</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">an anti-war campaign more more generally</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">or an environmental</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">uh group identities can you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">number of identities i haven&#39;t stopped</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">being a bombs and bullets guy</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">even though i&#39;m hoping to seek that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">telos as well and i care deeply about</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">and other related uh issues so i i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">this notion of anarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">can also look inward as well because</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">many of us</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">uh have quite a few different dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">to ourselves the other elements that</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:51.960" style="s2">with their topologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">and we feel that the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.960" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">interconnectivity of all with all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">greater the potential strength i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">professor metcalf metcalf&#39;s law makes</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">this point very well when he says the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">power of a network is the square of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">number of interconnected nodes</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">and and i think that very well explains</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">how quickly the color revolution spun up</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:14.320" style="s2">had so much effect uh why the arab</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.320" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">on the scene though the way it did and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">certainly it explains things like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">social revolutions of 1848 as well they</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t have an internet but they had</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">telegraph and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">there was a lot of coordinating among</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">european cities on on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">uh connectivity so topology of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">network matters a a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">as far as the technology is concerned i</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">think the kind of connectivity we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">really primes us for making this leap</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">to the next stage in human intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">and hopefully social evolution as well i</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">know david</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">has wonderful works on this and we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">make sure you have links to his studies</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">of how we</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">humans have evolved from tribes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">institutions to markets</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">to uh networked societies and and and i</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">an exceptionally profound uh work that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">um i i think you&#39;d enjoy very much it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">give you a good sense of how to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">uh this this movement into a networked</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">i have a bit of a follow-up if peter</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">phil allow me</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">um when i think about you know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">can create a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">now and anyone can sort of accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">uh brain power towards a cause a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">compelling story</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">i see it as a very asymmetric warfare</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">type of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">uh power where the individual can</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">compete with</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">with more traditional states um</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">it leads me to wonder from uh from a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">moral perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">is asymmetric warfare in and of itself a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">desirable thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">um so yeah if you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">share some thoughts on that yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">personally i think all warfare strives</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">to be asymmetric you don&#39;t want simply</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">to go straight at the opponent all all</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">strategy remember what sun tzu said when</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">your opponent is strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">in the east strike in the west do</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">something break the symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">of the situation and now as you so</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">rightly</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">pointed out we&#39;re seeing tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">asymmetries</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">uh in terms of the barriers to entry for</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">having influence have dropped</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:28.320" style="s2">substantially thanks to this technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">and to my mind it&#39;s a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.320" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">and you know this isn&#39;t simply a story</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">about the conduits everyone has the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">conduit</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">but who has the content that catches on</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">right just about every person in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">world has a has a website</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">but how many of them get many clicks</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">handful that dominate the the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">a relative handful that dominate the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">discourse space</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">so the content that narrative who&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">the right story</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">and and what david and i have been uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">trying to point out is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">the terrible shortcomings of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">traditional story about force and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">statecraft and what is needed</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">and the great great potential of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">uh the system that that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">about here which is much more driven by</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">norms and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">and values and common purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">and you know in most of human history</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">uh power was hoarded uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">the world we&#39;re looking at is one in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">which information and power</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">are are shared something else i would</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">just say and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">writing about this for almost 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">as as well</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2">is we move into an age when what people</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">solid hard power is actually softening</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">itself it&#39;s becoming less influential</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">and the context the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">the informational dimension has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">hardening and having greater</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">uh influence and i think that&#39;s a trend</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">that will continue</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">as as well</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">next all right uh rain you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">hey john thanks for being here and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">thanks for your seminal contributions</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">um i want to ask your thoughts basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">the game b post rivalry infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">space and um just your thoughts but to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">contextualize it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">um i um i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">listened to a lot of daniel</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">schmuckenberger&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">there are certain thinkers like daniel</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">that have</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">um sort of taken a big step back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">and seen that have the have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">all forms of competitive game theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">combined with the exponential growth of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">technology and the weaponization of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">is sort of a formula for for disaster no</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">matter what</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">so um maybe this is a a stretch to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">uh someone who&#39;s kind of an expert as</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">in statecraft but do you think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">place for post-rivalry do you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">possible do you think</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s um necessary</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">or and if you believe there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">of hybrid relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">uh rivalrous uh local rival liberal</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">situation with global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">um i&#39;d be curious to hear about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">i love this question and i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">any of my graduate students are</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">still here participating but we uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">that we go year round i&#39;m at a military</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">school and one of the things i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.280" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">them reading this quarter</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">is uh robert axelrod&#39;s evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">and what i love about is he takes a game</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">theory construct the prisoner&#39;s dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">where you know right two prisoners in</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">different rooms and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s seen law and order knows</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">that you separate them and you say</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">whoever</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">squeals first gets the better deal and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">so in game theoretic terms it always</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">the dominant strategy is always to rat</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">on the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">guy what axelrod did is he said what if</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">prisoner&#39;s dilemma wasn&#39;t single play</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">but it went out for some indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">period could ever could cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">evolve under that circumstance even in</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">dire situation and and he ran a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">of uh computer tournaments uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">on this and uh each time</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">the nice program that never ratted on</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">the other guy first</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">did the best and did that in two expert</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">tournament tournaments</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">and then he played an early version of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">what we would today call the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">which was evolutionary in nature that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">went out</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">twenty thousand thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">iterations of of the game</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">and pointed out how even a small cluster</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">of cooperative regimes will gain more</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">and more space over time</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">against the more conflictually oriented</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">programs</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">and it is most most fascinating when did</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">he write that like 35 36 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">but i think bob axelrod was was on to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">something as long as the window of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">remains indefinite i i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">and the telos is not something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">going to try to reach in 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">but if we think in terms of a longer</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">timeline uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:22.839" style="s2">my my bet is on new politique as having</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">a much longer life span than rail</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.839" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">politik</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">great question uh kyle you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">cheers thanks for a lovely talk so far</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about identity</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">inside of novopolitik</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">and you already alluded to it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">earlier and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">as i think as i observe networks and to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">kind of allude to peter&#39;s work we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">the effects of networks on this</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">enhancing of mimetic and tribal identity</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">right and as well as people being able</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">to find each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">uh amplify voices etc so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">how does identity work in that alluding</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">what you said earlier about kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">decline of nationalism and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking of john john rob&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">here where</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">he also has kind of alluded to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">declining nationalism and declining</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">these sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">so what is the role of identity inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">these politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">and how does it manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">does it become even more do we become</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">have to go through a period of even</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">stronger identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">before we integrate and and move past</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">or is it just uh you know how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">that playing out</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">i i try to grapple with it by accepting</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">i&#39;m multi-dimensional you know i can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">an environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">and a defense guy who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">given an oath to my country i can still</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">my country as a focus of loyalty but be</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">these other things as well and i i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">in particular as as we look at these</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">broader</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">narratives of of the networks they</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">create what benedict anderson called</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">the imagined community and i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">excited about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">because nation building is a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">fraught business</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s uh especially in those cases</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">where the united states has over the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">past few decades</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">tried to reroute the currents of culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">and history with armed force</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">to do nation building and it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">that it is far more productive to</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">understand the imagined community</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">who do the afghans think think they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">i mean they always had</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">an identity it was very light at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">national level</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">but they were they were the people of of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">the mountains</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">they they were the people who were the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">most independent</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">in in the world uh they um</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">and there weren&#39;t xenophobes there were</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">always an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">and a crossroads of trade they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">genetic mix of many different peoples</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">uh they&#39;re among the most uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">multi-dimensional creatures</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">in the world i know that probably goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">against a lot of what people have heard</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">about afghanistan</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">these past few decades but there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">most most remarkable people</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">and we have to embrace the imagined</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">community there rather than try to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">what what we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">done so my hope is that we will see</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">nations and networks coexisting</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">in a way that will eventually tend more</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">to favor</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">this idea of that the aspects of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">identity that look more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">uh nationalism has not gone away and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">the face</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">of this emerging networked world</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">the reaction of some has been to try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">double down on nationalism certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">notion of america first is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:43:59.839" style="s2">to do that we&#39;re we&#39;re not out here for</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">the global benefit but</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.839" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">guess what if we don&#39;t have that global</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">even what we have at home isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">last the planet is going to go to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">and there are so many even issues like</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">transnational crime and terror will</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">never be dealt with all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">require more to be dealt with than</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">single nations even very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">nations can</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">can deal with so i i like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">as as having different facets at one</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">david and i used the roman god janus to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">uh depict the the spirit of of networks</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">if you&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">janus is the two-faced god the older one</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">looking back</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">the younger one looking forward and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">maybe maybe janus is the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">identity for this time arthur kessler</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">wrote a wonderful book about this simply</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">entitled janus</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">in which he said that there is this dual</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">that seeks to connect but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">realizes the importance of assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">the self and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">he thought that you know social</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">evolution was going to play out with</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">this janus-like phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">in in play so that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">about identity no thank you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">cool albert kim you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">okay awesome um so i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">work my way up here um</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">thank you so much very appropriate right</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to be like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">um so my question was uh could it be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">lack of a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">information posture by the us uh is due</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">to its widespread domestic</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">and international destability</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">stabilization efforts</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">i found it very uh uh curious i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">reading through your white paper</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">and it i mean like there was this i</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">thought maybe you&#39;re just buttering the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">defense</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">uh uh the defense department up but like</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t think that yeah because i</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">mean like the uh the us has been pumping</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">out this info misinfo</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">uh you know uh interfering in domestic</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">domestic and international affairs for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">long time so could it actually be that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">a lack of our of a coherent information</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">posture is because</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">we have our tentacles all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">and th this</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">if this is true i mean this would</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">support your stance that the nation</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">is not the right level at which no</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">politic uh can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">affected so i was wondering like what</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">new forms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">non-state organizations you see arising</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">like the best implement</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">no no no politique and also as an extra</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">um could you maybe speak on how the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">discrete realms the geosphere biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">knows here can be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">because i believe like the way out for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">humanity is like to build this technium</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">to build this whole house to build the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">no sphere and then integrate everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">into a single system</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">um so i was wondering maybe if you would</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">speak on that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">absolutely uh wow i hope we have about</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">two more hours</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">here look i i think you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">right about</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">the problems with the american</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">i think this is a central challenge of</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">the newest fear does not spread and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">thrive</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">like mars</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">right we we know that sometime in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">past mars had</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">rivers that ran and a better atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">and some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">say it even had a better magnetic field</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">back back then</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">so all these things are tied together</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">there is and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to sound like a 19th</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">but in fact one of the pieces we wrote</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">so you can google that but we we see all</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">these things as connected with each</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see the competitive system</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">fact will create</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">a degradation and i don&#39;t know how if</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">there are any political scientists in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">our zoom group today but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">basic assumption of power politics that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">the international system is anarchic</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">wow that&#39;s that&#39;s a recipe for absolute</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">non-competitive world i was basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">whether i&#39;m not sure how familiar you</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">guess mike my question is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">um uh look</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">does the noah sphere require as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">the development of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">commons from the local level to the</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">in order to operate that essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">com</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">right now we have a bipolar world of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">of the market in the state</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">and essentially we need to rein</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">introduce</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">our ancient commons back into uh the</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">even with some indigenous um</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:39.760" style="s2">mindset let&#39;s say to kind of to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">i believe what you&#39;ve been communicating</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.760" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">in most of your responses and your</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">yeah i i&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s if i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">got that you&#39;re absolutely right about</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">and the real question is</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">does the newest fear have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">really get traction</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">and to become the you know the principal</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">means of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">thinking about the world and will</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">neuropolitique become</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">in the way in which society functions</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">going forward and rather than think in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">requiring you know prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">i i tend to think of uh you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like the universe it all started</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">out dark</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">and then there are points of light and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">where those were those points of light</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:34.000" style="s2">our job is to expand and connect them up</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">and to cluster them</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.000" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">and i think the notion of the new sphere</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">helps that kind of clustering</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">along we&#39;re talking in cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">terms i hope i can use this</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">metaphor about the universe but i i</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">think the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">the overall environment is probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">hostile to the development</p>

<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">and that it is our job to build and gain</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">traction where we can and eventually we</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">will reach an inflection point</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">but the closer we get to environmental</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">and i i think david&#39;s belief as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">that we see some signs of progress</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">uh we see a yearning among peoples among</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">in the firmament and make sure that</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:23.920" style="s2">and if i&#39;m wrong about this uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">then vernodsky will be right and there</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.920" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">will be cataclysm that those i think are</p>

<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">universe of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">of dark matter uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">we are and ideas are i think the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">best hope</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">tayard was very much an optimist and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">a great admirer</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">of his and when i reflect on it</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">even you know the hardest of hard power</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">advocates like hans morgenthau</p>

<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">there is something else without which</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">no system of power politics or any kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">of politics will ultimately work</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:21.359" style="s2">and so even if the wise people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">employ and practice the business of real</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.359" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">politic realize this then i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">there&#39;s hope for all</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">so uh again thank you all this has been</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">creating a virtual stoa would that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">more of these in the virtual world the</p>
