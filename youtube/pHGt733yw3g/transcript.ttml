<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:17.729" style="s2">here in the US and in the West more</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.060" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">generally and to be honest I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.729" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">exactly sure how to start this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">conversation for one thing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">conversation is obviously in large</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">measure about race but I don&#39;t even feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">comfortable asserting what anyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">race is and I&#39;m not even sure I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">what mine is supposed to be so forgive</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">me for having invited you here on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:45.000" style="s2">basis of having some African ancestry I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">believe that that fact is is sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.000" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">to set the conversation in motion and at</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">some level that makes me the token white</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">in this conversation so I guess is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">is that some kind of progress all of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">have entirely African ancestry that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">Thank You Chloe I probably should have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">said recent African ancestry and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">I should ask recent African ancestry is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">it fair to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:18.299" style="s2">say that you know I&#39;m an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:21.530" style="s2">biologist so recent to me means</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.299" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">something like the last thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.530" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">is it fair to assume that each of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">traces your ancestry to Africa and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:36.660" style="s2">leat in the last thousand years okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">fair enough all right now I should also</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.660" end="00:02:43.530" style="s2">probably warn you upfront that my sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:46.709" style="s2">is that we are involved in a renewed</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.530" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">racial conflict in the US and that it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.709" end="00:02:53.579" style="s2">very badly cast and that in fact it is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">distraction from a much deeper issue</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.579" end="00:02:57.989" style="s2">which has to do with long-standing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">extensive political corruption which has</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.989" end="00:03:03.569" style="s2">frozen citizens out of the well being</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:05.780" style="s2">that is produced by their labor in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.569" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">markets and that we are in effect being</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">misled into fighting each other when</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">there is a much more obvious enemy so in</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">light of that I will at some point</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">during this conversation want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">you about what solution might lead us</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:24.389" style="s2">out of this catastrophe but before I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">to a discussion of community 2020 and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.389" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">what it might have to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">situation I&#39;m very interested to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">different conversation with you all in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:37.709" style="s2">essence I invited you because I know you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">all to be incredibly courageous and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.709" end="00:03:46.349" style="s2">be very deep thinkers on many issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:48.389" style="s2">including race my hope is that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.349" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">will strike people who see this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.389" end="00:03:56.450" style="s2">which is that we have assembled here on</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">our screen an incredible group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.450" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">courageous public intellectuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">also African American in part or in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">whole however it is that you define</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:11.069" style="s2">yourselves and that the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">african-american community or is it fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.069" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">for me to say black</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">is that an acceptable term yeah I do - I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">do - it&#39;s the one I grew up with and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">feels it feels right to me as well that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:28.950" style="s2">what I know from my own life and from</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:31.290" style="s2">interacting with many of you is that for</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.950" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">some reason and I confess it&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.290" end="00:04:37.350" style="s2">I do not know the black community has</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">produced more top-flight public</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.350" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">intellectuals than any other population</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">I know of I don&#39;t know the cause but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">fact that that is the case is striking</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">and I hope people will notice and start</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">thinking about what may be going on one</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">hypothesis is that it has something to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:55.710" style="s2">do with adversity I&#39;d be interested to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:57.690" style="s2">hear what you all think but before we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.710" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">get there what I&#39;d like is each of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.690" end="00:05:04.980" style="s2">to give a sense of where you think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">might be given the George Floyd protests</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.980" end="00:05:09.330" style="s2">the black lives matter movement and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">national conversation I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">have an idea of where you think we might</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:16.950" style="s2">be headed as a nation so you&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:18.419" style="s2">different orientations on each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.950" end="00:05:20.310" style="s2">screens why don&#39;t we go with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.419" end="00:05:23.130" style="s2">orientation on my screen Glenn are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.310" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">willing to start here I&#39;ll start I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.130" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">want to stand in the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">brilliant observation so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">follow</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:33.450" style="s2">we&#39;re in deep doo-doo man I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:36.360" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re in the grips of something I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">think I&#39;m not sure I can give all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.360" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">parameters and I don&#39;t want to take too</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">long but that I think is a very serious</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.990" end="00:05:43.410" style="s2">problem for the country I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:47.220" style="s2">out of touch with reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.410" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">I think demagoguery is afoot I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.220" end="00:05:52.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of sophomoric reflections</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">about social problem and organization</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.680" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">that has just consumed all the air in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:03.450" style="s2">the room and we&#39;re we&#39;re boxing as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">shadows and whatnot then I&#39;ll just give</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.450" end="00:06:07.140" style="s2">one illustration of this and I&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">there supposed to be an epidemic of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.140" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">racist police killings of black people I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s true I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:16.410" style="s2">literally false I don&#39;t think these</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.490" style="s2">events that we&#39;re observing or even</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.490" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">think the unreflective imputation of</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.979" end="00:07:08.129" style="s2">can focus on the opportunity in a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.809" end="00:07:10.799" style="s2">that calls forth some things that need</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.129" end="00:07:15.119" style="s2">to happen right now I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.799" end="00:07:18.469" style="s2">this zealous pursuit of an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.119" end="00:07:21.809" style="s2">victory in favor of a certain version of</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:47.819" style="s2">and capitulation to a series of demands</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.769" end="00:07:51.269" style="s2">my feeling is that the is that America</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.819" end="00:07:53.699" style="s2">is not a fundamentally racist nation but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.269" end="00:07:56.519" style="s2">that black America faces problems that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.699" end="00:07:58.829" style="s2">are complex and systemic both of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.519" end="00:08:01.079" style="s2">things can be true at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.829" end="00:08:02.669" style="s2">I think that a moment like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.079" end="00:08:05.099" style="s2">moment in which the nation is paying</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.669" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">greater attention to the plight of black</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.099" end="00:08:09.329" style="s2">America and if that happens in a way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:11.219" style="s2">where those energies can be diverted</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.329" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">towards sensitive listening and an</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.969" style="s2">our reality then we can make the space</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.239" end="00:08:19.829" style="s2">for genuine progress to occur but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.969" end="00:08:22.229" style="s2">have to move past the demagoguery and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.829" end="00:08:24.059" style="s2">the demonization that is characterized</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.970" end="00:08:56.189" style="s2">country for most at this moment is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.149" end="00:09:01.649" style="s2">fact that policing is a difficult job</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.189" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">and we have you know the way the police</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.649" end="00:09:07.769" style="s2">are structured often doesn&#39;t provide</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.009" end="00:09:21.449" style="s2">to the dominant rhetoric coming out of</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.449" end="00:09:27.449" style="s2">now we we live in a country with more</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.300" end="00:09:30.749" style="s2">guns than people where when police pull</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.259" end="00:09:51.089" style="s2">that&#39;s a uniquely American situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:55.079" style="s2">because of how much of a gun country we</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:06.990" style="s2">more optimistic about the prospect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.379" end="00:10:09.569" style="s2">never seeing a George Floyd or Tony</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.990" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">Tempah like incident again where</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.569" end="00:10:15.319" style="s2">somewhere where a cop is just has his</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.319" end="00:10:22.290" style="s2">essentially kills them in that way I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:23.939" style="s2">think it&#39;s possible to to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.290" end="00:10:25.350" style="s2">place where we never see an incident or</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.939" end="00:10:27.509" style="s2">almost never seen an incident like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.350" end="00:10:29.429" style="s2">I&#39;m not at all optimistic about getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.509" end="00:10:31.379" style="s2">to a place where we never see an unarmed</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.429" end="00:10:36.149" style="s2">America in of any particular race</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.379" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">getting shot by a cop but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.149" end="00:10:44.699" style="s2">I think you know the media has prepared</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">black people to think of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.699" end="00:10:48.149" style="s2">event as something that only or</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:50.429" style="s2">overwhelmingly happens to black people</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.149" end="00:10:51.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re therefore to react as if our</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.429" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">people are being</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.520" end="00:10:56.230" style="s2">hunted by selectively omitting all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">cases where this happens to white people</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.230" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">and I see lots of what seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:07.240" style="s2">purely symbolic fake solutions to these</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:10.830" style="s2">problems being offered reparations how</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.240" end="00:11:10.830" style="s2">does that help police brutality</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:17.790" style="s2">you know hiring more black people at in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.250" end="00:11:20.230" style="s2">c-suite positions at corporations</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.790" end="00:11:22.620" style="s2">where&#39;s the link between that and fixing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.230" end="00:11:25.510" style="s2">broken public schools so I see lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.620" end="00:11:27.310" style="s2">fake solutions being offered to real</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.510" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">problems and that worries me because</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.310" end="00:11:38.500" style="s2">they appear in people&#39;s minds to be real</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:40.120" style="s2">solutions great Thomas yeah well to pick</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.500" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">a phone where Coleman left off I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.120" end="00:11:45.640" style="s2">actually do think that that something</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:48.550" style="s2">some sort of reparations might go a long</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.640" end="00:11:51.610" style="s2">way towards or healing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.550" end="00:11:54.490" style="s2">divisions in our society I start from</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:57.580" style="s2">the premise that race isn&#39;t real what</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.490" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">racism is and that is specific people</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.580" end="00:12:02.350" style="s2">that have been in this country since the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">collision of Europe and Africa 400 some</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.350" end="00:12:07.500" style="s2">odd years ago happened have been failed</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.500" end="00:12:15.940" style="s2">geography and then a lot of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.510" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">inequality could be fixed with some type</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.940" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">of solution that I don&#39;t have right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:20.890" style="s2">to go off the top of my head with but</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:23.410" style="s2">that the idea of reparations might do</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.890" end="00:12:25.510" style="s2">something towards helping racial</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.410" end="00:12:30.190" style="s2">division I also think from where I sit</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.510" end="00:12:32.410" style="s2">you know just looking back at America</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.190" end="00:12:34.570" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinary once you leave to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.410" end="00:12:36.580" style="s2">realize how violent is society it is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.570" end="00:12:39.510" style="s2">how extraordinarily violent the police</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.580" end="00:12:42.010" style="s2">are towards all American citizens</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.510" end="00:12:44.200" style="s2">compared to other wealthy societies so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.010" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">the police kill upwards of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.200" end="00:12:50.620" style="s2">people a year over 500 of those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:55.540" style="s2">will be white 10 out of every million of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.620" end="00:12:58.330" style="s2">those of those thousand will be Native</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.540" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">American it&#39;s the the proportion is six</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.330" end="00:13:03.820" style="s2">out of a million for for blacks 2.2 out</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:04.640" style="s2">of a million for whites and Asians are</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.820" end="00:13:06.590" style="s2">very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.640" end="00:13:10.310" style="s2">killed by police so there is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.590" end="00:13:11.750" style="s2">and whites get the bulk of the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.310" end="00:13:13.430" style="s2">but blacks are disproportionately killed</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.750" end="00:13:16.190" style="s2">not in the worst situation compared</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.430" end="00:13:19.460" style="s2">compared to Native Americans you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.190" end="00:13:22.040" style="s2">imagine a situation where a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.460" end="00:13:23.810" style="s2">call for policing reform should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.040" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">something that all American citizens are</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.810" end="00:13:29.000" style="s2">invested in and so I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:30.200" style="s2">the rhetoric has already been said here</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.000" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">part of the rhetoric that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.200" end="00:13:37.190" style="s2">uniquely or specifically black problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:39.110" style="s2">does more to hinder lasting and an</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.190" end="00:13:42.700" style="s2">important solution than trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.110" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">common ground and common problems to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.700" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">excellent John McWhorter I think what</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:55.970" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing right now at this moment is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">that a certain radical strain of anti</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.170" end="00:14:13.220" style="s2">extremely frightening to other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.410" end="00:14:14.750" style="s2">because one of its main tenets is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.220" end="00:14:18.140" style="s2">to not agree with it makes you a racist</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.750" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">so we&#39;re in a society where to be called</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.140" end="00:14:21.740" style="s2">a racist is essentially equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:24.400" style="s2">being called a pedophile and you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.740" end="00:14:28.280" style="s2">this minority of people with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.400" end="00:14:30.380" style="s2">frankly half-cocked notion of how we</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.380" end="00:14:35.660" style="s2">that entails burning everything down and</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.380" end="00:15:28.500" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking is correct because</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.820" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">frankly a lot of them have been trained</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.500" end="00:15:32.640" style="s2">not to think very hard about race it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">all very intellectually mediocre but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.640" end="00:15:38.550" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna look over and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">point that we&#39;re at right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.550" end="00:15:44.780" style="s2">these people are threatening to tear</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.780" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">create this kind of Orwellian America</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">women and humans to face this mob down</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:04.290" style="s2">and that hasn&#39;t been happening before</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:06.450" style="s2">generally the ordinary person who knows</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.290" end="00:16:07.950" style="s2">that all that stuff is nonsense goes</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.450" end="00:16:09.450" style="s2">along with it because they want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.950" end="00:16:10.650" style="s2">their job and they have kids to raise</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.450" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">they have bigger fish to fry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.650" end="00:16:14.090" style="s2">completely understandable but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:17.490" style="s2">gonna work this time and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.090" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">wondering whether the ordinary person</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.490" end="00:16:22.470" style="s2">who knows that all of that stuff is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:25.470" style="s2">new kind of Stalinism is gonna have it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.470" end="00:16:28.230" style="s2">in them to start saying no they might</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.470" end="00:16:30.300" style="s2">not in which case I really do fear for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.230" end="00:16:33.089" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.300" end="00:16:35.940" style="s2">see signs that they might there might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.089" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">a way of keeping this from going any</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.940" end="00:16:40.770" style="s2">further than it already herds I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:43.500" style="s2">to see what happens this calendar year</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.770" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">as we go into the fall how many people</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.500" end="00:16:46.500" style="s2">are going to be capable of standing up</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.060" end="00:16:48.570" style="s2">to this sort of thing because after a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.500" end="00:16:50.310" style="s2">few people did after a few organizations</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.570" end="00:16:52.620" style="s2">did then there would be a copycat</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.310" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">phenomenon once once people start to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.620" end="00:16:56.670" style="s2">if the sky won&#39;t fall in if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:59.100" style="s2">says you&#39;re a racist and you just stand</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.670" end="00:17:00.330" style="s2">there and say okay once they realize</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.100" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">that the world will keep spinning</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.330" end="00:17:07.189" style="s2">that&#39;ll start happening more I hope it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:11.610" style="s2">does all right Chloe</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.189" end="00:17:15.150" style="s2">so I would say to piggyback on what has</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.610" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">already been said that for me this looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.150" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">like a crisis of meaning in the country</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:24.949" style="s2">so I think that we are as citizens</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:28.380" style="s2">increasingly atomized and isolated both</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.949" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">socially certainly due to Coba 19 but</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.380" end="00:17:32.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve been isolated prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.690" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">and I also think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.370" end="00:17:37.500" style="s2">spiritual malnourishment in the country</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:41.059" style="s2">that manifests itself in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.500" end="00:17:44.009" style="s2">one of which is racially I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.059" end="00:17:47.759" style="s2">the way in which this idea of anti</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.009" end="00:17:51.179" style="s2">racism has been proliferating over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.759" end="00:17:53.970" style="s2">past few months is a direct product of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.179" end="00:17:57.899" style="s2">that spiritual male nourishment and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.970" end="00:18:00.210" style="s2">without addressing that issue we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.899" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">continue to have these issues pop up</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.210" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">every so often and I agree that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">will be able to be sort of kept at bay</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:13.980" style="s2">if the average person is able to stand</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">up for themselves and say no but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.980" end="00:18:22.019" style="s2">sure if the average person actually has</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">that fortitude and that confidence to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.019" end="00:18:25.559" style="s2">so I will say that I have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:28.710" style="s2">approached specifically because of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.559" end="00:18:34.129" style="s2">theory of Enchantment and the way it</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.710" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">actually teaches texts by a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.129" end="00:18:38.100" style="s2">traditional african-american scholars of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:41.190" style="s2">you know the Harlem Renaissance movement</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.100" end="00:18:42.389" style="s2">and such I have been I have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:46.019" style="s2">approached by people looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.389" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">alternatives to some of the anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.019" end="00:18:49.620" style="s2">programming that&#39;s been promoted by even</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:51.690" style="s2">Kendi in the workplace and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.620" end="00:18:53.909" style="s2">corporations and in schools I have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:57.899" style="s2">approached by people so in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.909" end="00:18:59.580" style="s2">diversity and inclusion you know asking</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.899" end="00:19:02.190" style="s2">me for an alternative through the theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.580" end="00:19:04.529" style="s2">of Enchantment lays so that is very I</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.190" end="00:19:06.509" style="s2">think hopeful just to see that people</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.529" end="00:19:12.179" style="s2">are actually looking for alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.509" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s possible that the rise of folks</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.179" end="00:19:16.860" style="s2">like Abram kindy and Robyn D&#39;Angelo is</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:19.259" style="s2">actually very going to be short-lived I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.860" end="00:19:23.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know what we shall see but I also</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.259" end="00:19:27.690" style="s2">think and a more hopeful sort of point</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.730" end="00:19:30.899" style="s2">that the people writ large the American</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.690" end="00:19:32.309" style="s2">people in in the same way that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.899" end="00:19:34.789" style="s2">susceptible to being sort of whipped</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.309" end="00:19:37.590" style="s2">into a frenzy by the media and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.789" end="00:19:39.869" style="s2">susceptible to being polarized and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.590" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">sort of turning against each other again</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.869" end="00:19:43.019" style="s2">because of that spiritual nourishment</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">because we gravitates what politics as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.019" end="00:19:48.420" style="s2">form of religion now</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:49.650" style="s2">I think we are also encouraged I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.420" end="00:19:53.040" style="s2">encouraging signs that we&#39;re all so</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.650" end="00:19:54.630" style="s2">tired of a lot of this being whipped</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.040" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2">into a frenzy and tired of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.630" end="00:19:58.200" style="s2">tearing each other apart at the seams</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:20:00.330" style="s2">and are really hungry for something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.200" end="00:20:01.680" style="s2">would actually be unifying and bring us</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.330" end="00:20:08.070" style="s2">together so I think that that is cause</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:10.680" style="s2">for great hope great Camille um I I do</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.070" end="00:20:11.970" style="s2">like batting cleanup in a situation like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.680" end="00:20:15.540" style="s2">this because so many great things have</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.970" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">already been said and while there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.540" end="00:20:19.470" style="s2">disagreement in a couple of specific</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.380" style="s2">places I think I am in broad agreement</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.470" end="00:20:24.300" style="s2">with the general theme I will say that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.380" end="00:20:25.559" style="s2">I think it&#39;s important to pay some</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.300" end="00:20:27.150" style="s2">attention to the context we find</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.559" end="00:20:29.250" style="s2">ourselves in I mean this the country is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.150" end="00:20:32.220" style="s2">in a very vulnerable position</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.250" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve just had actually are still in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.220" end="00:20:38.550" style="s2">throes of a global pandemic we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.740" style="s2">very beginning I think a pretty profound</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.550" end="00:20:42.390" style="s2">economic crisis that might play a play</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.740" end="00:20:45.900" style="s2">out over the course of the next decade</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.390" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2">and the specific manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.900" end="00:20:52.890" style="s2">concern like the waves of it the perixx</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:55.770" style="s2">paroxysm it are are important but</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.890" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">interestingly I don&#39;t know that the race</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.770" end="00:21:00.450" style="s2">is so central to it it&#39;s a piece of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:01.920" style="s2">conversation but it isn&#39;t all of it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.450" end="00:21:03.770" style="s2">as policing is a piece of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.770" end="00:21:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen ourselves sort of currying</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.900" end="00:21:10.770" style="s2">from a place where people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:13.530" style="s2">particularly concerned about an imagined</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.179" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">somehow a retrograde notion that should</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">be condemned and that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:40.800" style="s2">instituting new corrective curriculums</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.950" end="00:21:44.580" style="s2">and our workplaces and in our schools to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.800" end="00:21:51.530" style="s2">try and introduce new ways of thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.580" end="00:21:54.360" style="s2">lot of a lot of those tendencies the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.530" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">interest in sort of re-education and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.360" end="00:21:57.940" style="s2">realignment it&#39;d be one thing if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">were happening under normal so</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.940" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2">Constance&#39;s I think the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:03.429" style="s2">they&#39;re happening under these</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.980" end="00:22:05.490" style="s2">extraordinary circumstances makes this</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.429" end="00:22:07.899" style="s2">circumstance all the more disconcerting</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.490" end="00:22:09.250" style="s2">so I do think it&#39;s important to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.899" end="00:22:11.139" style="s2">these conversations about race and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.250" end="00:22:14.230" style="s2">identity I think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.139" end="00:22:18.639" style="s2">engage on conversations about structural</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.230" end="00:22:20.350" style="s2">racism and yes historic injustice --is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.639" end="00:22:23.019" style="s2">that have perpetuated certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.350" end="00:22:24.429" style="s2">inequality but I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.019" end="00:22:26.610" style="s2">important not to lose sight of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.429" end="00:22:29.889" style="s2">broader context and the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.610" end="00:22:32.200" style="s2">mmm rectifying any one of those problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.889" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">probably doesn&#39;t get us out of the bind</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.200" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">that we find ourselves in great all</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:42.370" style="s2">right so I want to tell you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:44.200" style="s2">about how I&#39;m seeing this and what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.370" end="00:22:46.360" style="s2">think we might do about it in particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.200" end="00:22:49.899" style="s2">right here in this conversation or at</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.360" end="00:22:52.990" style="s2">least starting there so my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.899" end="00:22:55.659" style="s2">race is simultaneously central and for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.990" end="00:22:58.870" style="s2">good reason and a distraction and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.659" end="00:23:01.389" style="s2">that is confusing us because you can you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.870" end="00:23:03.820" style="s2">can sort of see one version of the story</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.389" end="00:23:05.409" style="s2">in which races some have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.820" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">artificially elevated and another</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.409" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">version of the story in which it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:12.519" style="s2">problem that has to be solved and by</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">dodging back and forth between those two</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.519" end="00:23:17.350" style="s2">perspectives you don&#39;t get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:20.919" style="s2">there are several things I heard you all</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.350" end="00:23:26.679" style="s2">say Coleman was talking about false</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.919" end="00:23:28.779" style="s2">solutions in particular and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.679" end="00:23:31.899" style="s2">said to John McWhorter in the podcast I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.779" end="00:23:34.600" style="s2">I did with him that I believe we have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.899" end="00:23:37.090" style="s2">an overarching problem which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.600" end="00:23:38.440" style="s2">with the absence of leaders and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.090" end="00:23:40.809" style="s2">it&#39;s not even the absence of leaders</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:43.269" style="s2">it&#39;s the conversion of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.809" end="00:23:45.549" style="s2">leadership into the idea of influencer</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.269" end="00:23:48.700" style="s2">and influencer to me is a very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.549" end="00:23:50.980" style="s2">weaker position and so I know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.700" end="00:23:53.409" style="s2">looking at a screen full of people that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.980" end="00:23:55.870" style="s2">are capable of leadership at every level</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.409" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">right you&#39;re capable of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.870" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">what a leader must do you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:02.740" style="s2">marshalling the courage necessary to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">it well but the roles you are playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.740" end="00:24:08.070" style="s2">are ones in which the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:10.210" style="s2">actually need your insight are</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.070" end="00:24:11.049" style="s2">functioning in the role of consumer</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.210" end="00:24:12.879" style="s2">rather than said</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.049" end="00:24:16.450" style="s2">and that this is just an unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.879" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">dynamic so what I&#39;m hoping is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.450" end="00:24:23.019" style="s2">out how we can restore the we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:24.610" style="s2">restore leadership to the place in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.019" end="00:24:26.649" style="s2">minds that it should exist and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.610" end="00:24:27.789" style="s2">figure out how to populate it with</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.649" end="00:24:33.309" style="s2">people who can handle the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.789" end="00:24:35.559" style="s2">and my guess would be we have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.309" end="00:24:38.019" style="s2">ability to do something here we can all</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.559" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">say things that many will resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.019" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">about race and it&#39;s being a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:47.350" style="s2">or it&#39;s being a key problem that has to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:49.570" style="s2">be addressed once and for all but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.350" end="00:24:52.739" style="s2">other thing we could do is we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.570" end="00:24:55.570" style="s2">steer the ship directly into the storm</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.739" end="00:24:57.309" style="s2">right by demonstrating that it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.570" end="00:24:59.409" style="s2">possible to take all of the features of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.309" end="00:25:01.059" style="s2">the conversation of race that people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.409" end="00:25:03.220" style="s2">afraid to have and they are afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.059" end="00:25:04.869" style="s2">if those pieces of the conversation are</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.220" end="00:25:07.149" style="s2">raised that the conversation will go out</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.869" end="00:25:08.980" style="s2">of control and modeling that in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.149" end="00:25:12.309" style="s2">can do it well and that the result of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.980" end="00:25:15.129" style="s2">that conversation is not itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.309" end="00:25:18.730" style="s2">frightening that we might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.129" end="00:25:20.169" style="s2">indicate to people that there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.730" end="00:25:22.419" style="s2">out of this which is really the question</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.169" end="00:25:24.340" style="s2">John McWhorter was asking what will</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.419" end="00:25:26.889" style="s2">happen are we going to see people</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.340" end="00:25:29.649" style="s2">figuring out how to stand up or aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.889" end="00:25:31.149" style="s2">we and if we don&#39;t then what Glenn said</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.649" end="00:25:35.049" style="s2">is right we&#39;re in very serious trouble</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.149" end="00:25:37.379" style="s2">so are you willing to steer the ship</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.049" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">into the storm and deal with the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.379" end="00:25:42.210" style="s2">questions about race and just let the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">chips fall where they may</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.210" end="00:25:51.159" style="s2">yes let me suggest three questions good</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:55.090" style="s2">welfare affirmative action and crime</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.090" end="00:26:02.590" style="s2">terrible idea mobilizing a trillion</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:14.679" style="s2">very bad for the country South Africa</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.230" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">like categorization of its citizens very</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.679" end="00:26:20.919" style="s2">bad for black people setting us up the</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.580" style="s2">course more likely to engage in crime</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.169" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">it&#39;s what anybody would do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.580" end="00:28:37.779" style="s2">right if you don&#39;t have legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.350" end="00:28:38.610" style="s2">opportunities you will I&#39;m sorry Brett</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.779" end="00:28:41.110" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.610" end="00:28:43.780" style="s2">excuse me I don&#39;t want to know is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.110" end="00:28:46.150" style="s2">really is it really not patronizing a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.780" end="00:28:48.220" style="s2">community to say of they&#39;re criminals</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">it&#39;s what anybody would do when you just</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.220" end="00:28:51.790" style="s2">got through saying if someone did that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.020" end="00:28:54.670" style="s2">there are almost no Asians being killed</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.790" end="00:28:56.500" style="s2">by the police good all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.670" end="00:28:58.030" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s take this apart and figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.500" end="00:28:59.470" style="s2">out what we actually are saying and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.030" end="00:29:01.660" style="s2">we actually believe and I of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.470" end="00:29:06.060" style="s2">open to be convinced that I have it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.660" end="00:29:09.820" style="s2">wrong but my point would be you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.060" end="00:29:11.650" style="s2">very different history for people of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.820" end="00:29:13.570" style="s2">African descent who arrived in the new</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.650" end="00:29:16.150" style="s2">world and you have a different history</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.570" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">for Native Americans in the new world</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.150" end="00:29:22.630" style="s2">and then those two populations have had</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.040" style="s2">unique dysfunction as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.630" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">fact that their origin stories are</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.040" end="00:29:27.490" style="s2">different than the other populations</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.830" style="s2">that are here and so the only point that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:32.380" style="s2">I&#39;m really making it&#39;s not that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.830" end="00:29:33.640" style="s2">would do any of these crimes it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.380" end="00:29:35.710" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">opportunities you seek opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.710" end="00:29:39.580" style="s2">that are higher risk nobody wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.110" style="s2">to prison and you don&#39;t choose to engage</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.580" end="00:29:43.090" style="s2">in things that will tend to get you sent</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.110" end="00:29:45.280" style="s2">there if you have good opportunities but</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.090" end="00:29:46.990" style="s2">if you don&#39;t you may engage in behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.280" end="00:29:51.640" style="s2">that are likely to run you afoul of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.990" end="00:29:53.760" style="s2">police and so all I&#39;m asking is I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.640" end="00:29:55.960" style="s2">one of two things would have to be true</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.760" end="00:29:58.810" style="s2">either there&#39;s something about the black</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.960" end="00:30:01.690" style="s2">population that is more prone to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.810" end="00:30:03.640" style="s2">criminal or there&#39;s something causal</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.690" end="00:30:05.470" style="s2">that results in that population ending</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.640" end="00:30:07.900" style="s2">up in that category more frequently and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.470" end="00:30:09.940" style="s2">I believe strongly it&#39;s likely to be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.900" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">latter I&#39;ve seen no evidence that this</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.940" end="00:30:14.260" style="s2">is endogenous right I think you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:16.300" style="s2">of that is true but I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.260" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">missing one part and if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.300" end="00:30:20.170" style="s2">about beat dive this is deep and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:23.590" style="s2">very hard to quantify and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.170" end="00:30:25.660" style="s2">why many people refuse to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.590" end="00:30:27.610" style="s2">which is that there&#39;s a cultural issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.660" end="00:30:29.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about black culture going</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.610" end="00:30:31.270" style="s2">back centuries it&#39;s not about black</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.080" end="00:30:33.790" style="s2">culture or even going back 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.270" end="00:30:37.240" style="s2">but there was a turn in the mood in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.790" end="00:30:39.880" style="s2">1960s where in ways that fascinate me</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.240" end="00:30:41.890" style="s2">how this percolated from a small radical</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.880" end="00:30:43.930" style="s2">group into a general mood in a whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.890" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">community really fascinates me but</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.930" end="00:30:48.490" style="s2">something happened between 1960 and 1980</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.210" style="s2">that taught an awful lot of especially</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.490" end="00:30:52.570" style="s2">young black men that black authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.210" end="00:30:54.190" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.570" end="00:30:56.769" style="s2">checking out that black authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.190" end="00:31:00.039" style="s2">means that you get a pass because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.769" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">man doesn&#39;t like you and as vague as</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.039" end="00:31:04.869" style="s2">that sounds the difference between black</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:08.580" style="s2">culture in 1970 and black culture in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.869" end="00:31:10.599" style="s2">1950 even among the poorest is stark and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.580" end="00:31:13.809" style="s2">unmistakable something happened and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.599" end="00:31:16.269" style="s2">still have the legacy of that and so to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.809" end="00:31:18.070" style="s2">the extent that you know living in New</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.269" end="00:31:20.229" style="s2">York City this is something that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.070" end="00:31:22.869" style="s2">ever wants to say out loud you&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.229" end="00:31:26.229" style="s2">in the times you&#39;ll hear on NPR you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.869" end="00:31:28.239" style="s2">seven youths killed last night at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.229" end="00:31:31.659" style="s2">barbecue and you don&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.239" end="00:31:33.489" style="s2">wonder it&#39;s always always black people</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.659" end="00:31:34.299" style="s2">in certain neighborhoods now that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.489" end="00:31:36.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.299" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">with the people but the question is why</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.609" end="00:31:39.969" style="s2">aren&#39;t any poor white people doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">why isn&#39;t that happening in poor</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.969" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2">Chinatown&#39;s why isn&#39;t that happening in</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:46.989" style="s2">many towns in India you know poverty</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.950" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">alone doesn&#39;t explain that it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.989" end="00:31:53.320" style="s2">what came to be seen as normal in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:55.869" style="s2">wake of the Black Power moon and also</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.320" end="00:31:58.899" style="s2">the expansion of welfare with black</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.869" end="00:32:01.570" style="s2">people in mind starting in 1966 which</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.899" end="00:32:04.329" style="s2">was pernicious for family relations</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.570" end="00:32:06.309" style="s2">although nobody knew that&#39;s so I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.329" end="00:32:07.450" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re right poverty is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.309" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">but to the extent that anybody here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.450" end="00:32:11.379" style="s2">bristling a little bit it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">there&#39;s more there&#39;s a black thing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.379" end="00:32:15.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a very hard thing to talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:16.779" style="s2">it&#39;s there I don&#39;t know if all of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.070" end="00:32:19.599" style="s2">agree with me on this that&#39;s my my</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.779" end="00:32:23.469" style="s2">take-home I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to offer</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.599" end="00:32:25.599" style="s2">an analysis of of this period I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.469" end="00:32:26.679" style="s2">that by the way I&#39;m going to say all</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.599" end="00:32:28.149" style="s2">this with a great deal of humility</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:30.309" style="s2">because there several people on this</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.149" end="00:32:32.469" style="s2">call are gonna know more about specific</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.309" end="00:32:34.899" style="s2">aspects of what I&#39;m gonna lay out here</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.469" end="00:32:37.509" style="s2">than I do but this is my sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.899" end="00:32:40.869" style="s2">is up for correction I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.509" end="00:32:45.339" style="s2">think that John John McDuffie was</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.869" end="00:32:48.249" style="s2">opposed to john w here is right to pin</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.339" end="00:32:51.849" style="s2">our attention to the couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.249" end="00:32:54.369" style="s2">that followed after the end of the civil</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.849" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">rights seventies in the eighties my</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.369" end="00:33:00.789" style="s2">sense is that for most americans on</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:04.149" style="s2">either side of this well for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.789" end="00:33:05.420" style="s2">americans there is a sense that or at</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.149" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">least there was a sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.420" end="00:33:11.000" style="s2">that the black experience in America was</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:13.090" style="s2">something rotten with state-sponsored</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.000" end="00:33:15.590" style="s2">oppression and institutional racism</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.090" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">right up until the moment in which dr.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.590" end="00:33:19.790" style="s2">King was killed and after the passage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.990" end="00:33:22.460" style="s2">the Voting Rights Act so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.790" end="00:33:25.550" style="s2">from that after that however after the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.460" end="00:33:28.730" style="s2">success of the nonviolent movement the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.550" end="00:33:30.500" style="s2">major sort of barriers to meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.730" end="00:33:32.870" style="s2">equality in American life and black</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.500" end="00:33:34.610" style="s2">opportunity had been eliminated and at</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.870" end="00:33:36.830" style="s2">that point it simply became a question</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.610" end="00:33:38.870" style="s2">of our own cultural commitments and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.830" end="00:33:42.230" style="s2">personal responsibilities in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.870" end="00:33:43.790" style="s2">our ability to you know live up to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.230" end="00:33:45.950" style="s2">opportunities before us and that sadly</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.790" end="00:33:49.460" style="s2">the black community has failed to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.950" end="00:33:51.260" style="s2">that since then on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.460" end="00:33:53.720" style="s2">have this other narrative that says that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.260" end="00:33:55.880" style="s2">racism went underground and wound up</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.720" end="00:33:58.280" style="s2">being baked into the operations of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.880" end="00:34:00.860" style="s2">institutions and our systems but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.280" end="00:34:02.600" style="s2">remained just as pernicious and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:05.210" style="s2">white American majority remain just as</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.600" end="00:34:07.520" style="s2">committed to it and so now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.210" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">pull the structures of society down to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.520" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">get at the rotted sort of marrow of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">and that&#39;s the narrative that you see</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:17.960" style="s2">proliferating on the Left I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">there is truth enough in these</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.960" end="00:34:21.290" style="s2">perspectives to arrive at some clarity</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:24.169" style="s2">at what really happened but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.290" end="00:34:28.580" style="s2">complicated in my view this is how I</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.169" end="00:34:31.580" style="s2">look at it in the 1960s you had a number</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.580" end="00:34:34.250" style="s2">of things happen that sent the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.580" end="00:34:36.740" style="s2">and the structural sort of preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.250" end="00:34:38.690" style="s2">for the sort of developments of a black</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:15.160" style="s2">that do not manifest simply as white</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.720" style="s2">point out one way in which this unfolds</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.569" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a biological demographic fact if</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.660" end="00:41:07.690" style="s2">you take men out of a population it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:10.030" style="s2">disempowers women in negotiations in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.690" end="00:41:11.650" style="s2">mating and dating men who have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.030" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">sexual opportunity because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.650" end="00:41:15.550" style="s2">high demand are hard to pin down so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:17.470" style="s2">don&#39;t play the role of father which</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.550" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">means that to the extent that fathers</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.470" end="00:41:22.300" style="s2">are necessary to address questions of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:24.940" style="s2">why you should restrain violent impulses</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.300" end="00:41:27.310" style="s2">for example their absence then manifests</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.940" end="00:41:29.880" style="s2">as increasingly violent crime which goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.310" end="00:41:31.940" style="s2">to explain some of the patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.880" end="00:41:33.830" style="s2">several of you have mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.940" end="00:41:37.070" style="s2">about an increased propensity for blacks</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.830" end="00:41:38.900" style="s2">to kill each other so what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.070" end="00:41:41.150" style="s2">understand is why we aren&#39;t having that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.900" end="00:41:43.670" style="s2">discussion right something causes</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.150" end="00:41:45.830" style="s2">incarceration of black men and that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.670" end="00:41:49.670" style="s2">a bunch of predictable effects it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.830" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">straight forward all right okay can I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.670" end="00:41:54.050" style="s2">say something yeah I think you know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:42:00.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed talking to friends about</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.050" end="00:42:04.130" style="s2">this issue is that it has become a kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.470" end="00:42:07.730" style="s2">of political chip that is used sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.130" end="00:42:09.230" style="s2">cynically so you know the homicide is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.730" end="00:42:11.030" style="s2">the leading cause of death for black men</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.230" end="00:42:13.940" style="s2">in their 20s and even their early 30s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.030" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not true of Hispanics whites</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.940" end="00:42:20.570" style="s2">Asians that&#39;s a central problem it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:23.180" style="s2">I I I&#39;m fairly sure I could persuade</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.570" end="00:42:25.160" style="s2">someone that it&#39;s it&#39;s you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.180" end="00:42:28.250" style="s2">the biggest problems facing the country</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.160" end="00:42:31.430" style="s2">a problem a problem that we should have</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.250" end="00:42:33.020" style="s2">a national movement to solve there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.430" end="00:42:34.760" style="s2">difference between raising that issue on</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.020" end="00:42:36.890" style="s2">its own as something one should care</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.760" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">about in itself and raising it as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.890" end="00:42:42.380" style="s2">reason to dismiss the arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:44.180" style="s2">black lives matter is making and I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.380" end="00:42:47.360" style="s2">when it&#39;s raised in that second way</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.180" end="00:42:50.390" style="s2">people just Stonewall the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.360" end="00:42:52.420" style="s2">of fully that said even when he raised</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.390" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">it on its own people still Stonewall it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.420" end="00:43:00.080" style="s2">which is which is very depressing but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:43:02.390" style="s2">think I do think we have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.080" end="00:43:05.000" style="s2">issues obviously are related in certain</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.390" end="00:43:07.910" style="s2">key ways but I I do I think there should</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.000" end="00:43:10.550" style="s2">just be a conversation in itself about</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.910" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">the first order and second order</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.550" end="00:43:16.550" style="s2">consequences of crime not just for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.520" end="00:43:19.000" style="s2">victims but for the cycle of poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.550" end="00:43:22.520" style="s2">unemployment that it causes</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.000" end="00:43:24.230" style="s2">disinvestment any issue that almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.520" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">every issue that you will be tempted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.230" end="00:43:28.430" style="s2">care about related to poverty is made</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:31.490" style="s2">worse by crime and sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.430" end="00:43:33.410" style="s2">mainly caused by crime so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:34.970" style="s2">and and the second thing I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.410" end="00:43:37.340" style="s2">is that sometimes I feel that these</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.970" end="00:43:39.710" style="s2">questions are posed backwards so people</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.340" end="00:43:41.960" style="s2">ask why is there such a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.710" end="00:43:44.900" style="s2">in crime between blacks and whites for</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.960" end="00:43:45.650" style="s2">example or why do black people commit so</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.900" end="00:43:50.930" style="s2">much crime</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.650" end="00:43:53.809" style="s2">and I I I want to just insert you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.930" end="00:43:57.170" style="s2">Steven Pinker&#39;s thesis in in a book that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.809" end="00:43:59.950" style="s2">I admire greatly which is the better</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.170" end="00:44:02.900" style="s2">angel the better angels of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.950" end="00:44:04.220" style="s2">the which is about the enormous decline</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.900" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">in violence over the past several</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.220" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">hundred years of human history and his</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:14.119" style="s2">thesis is basically that the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">you should should ask is not why do why</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.119" end="00:44:18.500" style="s2">does a certain group of people commit so</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:21.740" style="s2">much crime but why do low crime</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.500" end="00:44:25.250" style="s2">populations commit so little crime</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.740" end="00:44:28.250" style="s2">because it could just be true that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.250" end="00:44:30.380" style="s2">natural state for members of our species</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.250" end="00:44:34.760" style="s2">is for young men to get together in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.380" end="00:44:37.369" style="s2">groups and be ready for violence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.760" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">nothing in human history that that made</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.369" end="00:44:41.180" style="s2">that that says that behavior is so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.400" style="s2">pathological that it needs a special</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.180" end="00:44:44.900" style="s2">explanation really what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.400" end="00:44:47.210" style="s2">explained is the fact that we now have</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.900" end="00:44:47.950" style="s2">societies where young men don&#39;t behave</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.210" end="00:44:52.039" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.950" end="00:44:53.869" style="s2">and as for crime disparities if you look</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.039" end="00:44:55.779" style="s2">in the early 20th century and compare</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.869" end="00:44:57.980" style="s2">how much crime Irish immigrants were</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.779" end="00:45:00.650" style="s2">committing compared to Norwegian and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.980" end="00:45:02.329" style="s2">Swedish immigrants you find disparities</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.650" end="00:45:04.309" style="s2">every bit as large as between blacks and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.329" end="00:45:06.200" style="s2">whites today if you look at the crime</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.309" end="00:45:08.569" style="s2">disparities between southern whites and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.200" end="00:45:11.869" style="s2">northern whites to this day it&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.569" end="00:45:13.910" style="s2">large so so what I want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.869" end="00:45:16.339" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing strange or cosmically</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.910" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">unusual about two groups of people with</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.339" end="00:45:19.579" style="s2">very different histories different</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:21.049" style="s2">cultures different circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.579" end="00:45:25.220" style="s2">committing very different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.049" end="00:45:27.500" style="s2">crime and and I&#39;m in a way it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.220" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">wrong question to ask to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.500" end="00:45:31.069" style="s2">bottom of why it is unless of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:34.250" style="s2">you&#39;re your solution-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.069" end="00:45:37.609" style="s2">which I am I&#39;m very curious about how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.250" end="00:45:40.220" style="s2">can lower crime rates violent crime</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.609" end="00:45:43.640" style="s2">rates and I&#39;m dismayed that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.220" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">conversation is either only used as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.640" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">way of dismissing police violence or</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:51.740" style="s2">just seen as synonymous with racism and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.690" style="s2">we&#39;re going to keep seeing all of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.740" end="00:45:55.970" style="s2">problems play out until the turn you</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.690" end="00:45:58.760" style="s2">know until the end of time unless we</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.970" end="00:46:00.870" style="s2">address that central problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.760" end="00:46:04.680" style="s2">great I know there are several others of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.870" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">you who are wanted to jump in just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.680" end="00:46:09.630" style="s2">to make a couple if the first is that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">certainly agree with what John McWhorter</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.630" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">was saying about culture I mean John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:18.210" style="s2">first book losing the race was really</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:20.190" style="s2">influential in my own thinking when I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.210" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">wrote my first book about the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.190" end="00:46:25.410" style="s2">which ideas of black authenticity can be</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.650" end="00:46:34.440" style="s2">the thing that Glen is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.470" end="00:46:36.530" style="s2">compelling argues that I have ever come</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.530" end="00:46:41.100" style="s2">disagree with him but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.820" end="00:46:43.080" style="s2">there are ways in which conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.100" end="00:46:45.540" style="s2">around reparations would make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.080" end="00:46:47.070" style="s2">sense and would not be demeaning or of</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.590" end="00:46:53.810" style="s2">would have to do with specific</p>

<p begin="00:46:53.810" end="00:46:58.350" style="s2">in a specific society so I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.820" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">beat that drum again but it&#39;s not about</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.320" end="00:49:23.370" style="s2">dichotomy between the rhetoric coming</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.030" end="00:49:26.520" style="s2">out of the quote-unquote anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.370" end="00:49:29.910" style="s2">movement and the way in which you are</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.460" end="00:49:36.450" style="s2">the home and I think it&#39;s just worth</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.450" end="00:49:41.340" style="s2">of that rhetoric that is being promoted</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.970" end="00:49:43.110" style="s2">in that and so-called anti-racist spaces</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.340" end="00:49:44.700" style="s2">and put it in a place like children of</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.700" end="00:49:50.490" style="s2">and you would continue to perpetuate</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.490" end="00:49:56.450" style="s2">and so I think just to add that we need</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.270" end="00:50:00.450" style="s2">to think about like the psychological</p>

<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:15.490" style="s2">fundamental principle that is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.990" end="00:54:18.020" style="s2">somewhat undermined by taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.490" end="00:54:20.900" style="s2">culpability and making it something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.020" end="00:54:23.000" style="s2">is intergenerational and taking even the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.900" end="00:54:26.300" style="s2">injury and making it something that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.000" end="00:54:29.050" style="s2">intergenerational the the notion of rule</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.300" end="00:54:33.170" style="s2">of law is something that is not merely</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.050" end="00:54:36.290" style="s2">like good gold or even a sufficient goal</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.170" end="00:54:38.540" style="s2">it is a pretty extraordinary thing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.290" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">has evaded most people throughout most</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.540" end="00:54:44.450" style="s2">of history and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:47.990" style="s2">instituting some regime of rewarding</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.990" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">their ancestors on account of their</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:58.100" style="s2">black essentially I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.960" end="00:55:01.400" style="s2">might actually impair that fabric and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.100" end="00:55:04.130" style="s2">know one thing I would say well I&#39;m well</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.400" end="00:55:05.240" style="s2">got the mic for a moment is I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.130" end="00:55:06.860" style="s2">there are people who will watch a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.240" end="00:55:09.350" style="s2">conversation like this and will</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.860" end="00:55:11.300" style="s2">immediately think that oh they&#39;re these</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.350" end="00:55:13.550" style="s2">are the folks who talk about culture as</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.300" end="00:55:14.540" style="s2">the fundamental problem it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.550" end="00:55:16.280" style="s2">the case that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.540" end="00:55:18.860" style="s2">unenlightened conversations that take</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.280" end="00:55:20.990" style="s2">place around these issues lots of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.860" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">thoughtless people who invoke culture as</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.990" end="00:55:23.480" style="s2">a response and just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.210" style="s2">black-on-black crime</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.480" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">in a sort of flippant way but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.210" end="00:55:30.170" style="s2">not what&#39;s happening here I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:32.660" style="s2">vast majority of the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.170" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">is happening in this country now with</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.660" end="00:55:37.310" style="s2">the ascendancy of the anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:39.500" style="s2">movement tends to focus narrowly and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.310" end="00:55:43.970" style="s2">specifically on these structural</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.500" end="00:55:45.590" style="s2">problems the fact that the folks on this</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.970" end="00:55:47.290" style="s2">particular in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.590" end="00:55:50.180" style="s2">conversation are interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.290" end="00:55:51.800" style="s2">complete complexity of the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.180" end="00:55:53.540" style="s2">those problems and the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.800" end="00:55:54.950" style="s2">what&#39;s required to actually address</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.540" end="00:55:57.860" style="s2">those problems whether or not we agree</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.950" end="00:56:00.110" style="s2">on the appropriateness of reparations as</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.860" end="00:56:02.990" style="s2">part of that solution I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.110" end="00:56:04.900" style="s2">very telling and important and that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.990" end="00:56:10.330" style="s2">what&#39;s happening here as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.900" end="00:56:12.860" style="s2">sort of flippant emphasis on on culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.330" end="00:56:14.870" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d like to pick up on that Camille</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.860" end="00:56:17.870" style="s2">and I really appreciate you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.870" end="00:56:21.190" style="s2">distilling that at the end there because</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.870" end="00:56:23.210" style="s2">I think that and while I appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.190" end="00:56:25.670" style="s2">perspectives that everybody is offering</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.210" end="00:56:27.950" style="s2">on reparations and I you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.670" end="00:56:30.680" style="s2">sympathy with so much of it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.950" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">think the question of reparations is is</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.680" end="00:56:35.540" style="s2">the fundamental one here because whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:38.090" style="s2">we do or go initiate anything like</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.540" end="00:56:39.530" style="s2">reparations eventually it anything we do</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.090" end="00:56:41.840" style="s2">or don&#39;t do there is going to succeed or</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.530" end="00:56:43.310" style="s2">fail on the basis of whether or not we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.840" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">have a larger framework for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.310" end="00:56:49.670" style="s2">conversation over race and black America</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:52.370" style="s2">specifically its relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.670" end="00:56:55.790" style="s2">structures of our larger society that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.370" end="00:56:58.130" style="s2">actually able to salvage what is true or</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.790" end="00:56:59.600" style="s2">what is even though what has a root of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.130" end="00:57:01.010" style="s2">truth to the different perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.600" end="00:57:03.380" style="s2">are on offer and these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.010" end="00:57:04.150" style="s2">simplified narratives the question is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.380" end="00:57:06.490" style="s2">can we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.150" end="00:57:09.460" style="s2">you know this column folks like us can</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.490" end="00:57:11.980" style="s2">we help build out a frame that actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.460" end="00:57:13.960" style="s2">captures of that in a way that can sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.980" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">of emerge the coherent narrative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.960" end="00:57:21.819" style="s2">that&#39;s point number one point number two</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">is how are we able to grow that frame</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.819" end="00:57:25.450" style="s2">that narrative within you know the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:29.109" style="s2">larger American conversation and within</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.450" end="00:57:31.930" style="s2">the internal conversation in in black</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.109" end="00:57:34.720" style="s2">America were the social sort of volition</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.930" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">towards you know a particular type of of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:42.039" style="s2">activism is gaining momentum at a an</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:44.500" style="s2">incredible pace for reasons that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.039" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">understandable I think that a frame such</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.500" end="00:57:49.720" style="s2">as that needs to sort of find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:51.059" style="s2">reconcile sort of the the proper or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.720" end="00:57:54.670" style="s2">real relationship that exists between</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.059" end="00:57:57.940" style="s2">between three things I think one is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.670" end="00:57:59.410" style="s2">role of culture and in society and human</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.940" end="00:58:03.010" style="s2">populations generally but certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.410" end="00:58:05.049" style="s2">black America two is the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.010" end="00:58:07.779" style="s2">between culture and structure and three</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.049" end="00:58:11.250" style="s2">it&#39;s the interaction between structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.779" end="00:58:15.849" style="s2">maybe structure and culture but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.250" end="00:58:17.619" style="s2">variable of whiteness right because that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.849" end="00:58:21.000" style="s2">is something that people are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.619" end="00:58:23.470" style="s2">as a tangible sort of sort of thing here</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.000" end="00:58:26.579" style="s2">what is the relationship between these</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.470" end="00:58:29.500" style="s2">between these things my sense again is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.579" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">that culture is sort of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.500" end="00:58:35.410" style="s2">question within within black America but</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:40.210" style="s2">that interacts with a pattern a history</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.410" end="00:58:42.700" style="s2">of systemic evolution that excuse a sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.210" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">of critical formation in the 70s and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.700" end="00:58:50.529" style="s2">80s I think and that because of a longer</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:51.849" style="s2">arc of history and the way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.529" end="00:58:53.710" style="s2">history has moved you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.849" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">people who look at whiteness is having</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.710" end="00:58:59.039" style="s2">animated this sort of perfect perverse</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:01.690" style="s2">kind of evolution of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.039" end="00:59:03.940" style="s2">precisely as you come out in the sixties</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.690" end="00:59:06.039" style="s2">during a period of time where we&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.940" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">another lids looking at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.039" end="00:59:10.660" style="s2">impact of Martin Luther King jr. the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">nonviolent movement the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.660" end="00:59:15.700" style="s2">the are the the integration of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:17.860" style="s2">popular culture changes that took place</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.700" end="00:59:20.470" style="s2">in the south and evangelical community</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.860" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">America became visibly less racist in</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.470" end="00:59:24.850" style="s2">terms of how we presented ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:27.300" style="s2">the world really the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.850" end="00:59:29.170" style="s2">evolution of racial attitudes in</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.300" end="00:59:31.390" style="s2">majority for the minds of the majority</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.170" end="00:59:31.930" style="s2">of Americans coming out from that period</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.390" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.930" end="00:59:35.980" style="s2">how did racial attitudes really shift in</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.240" end="00:59:38.710" style="s2">white America they shifted I think in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.980" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">positive direction but when we account</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.710" end="00:59:42.700" style="s2">for whiteness is animating the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:44.620" style="s2">depression then you get a very different</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.700" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">frame for understanding that so if we</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.620" end="00:59:48.670" style="s2">can blend clarity to those three</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:50.380" style="s2">variables I think you know what is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.670" end="00:59:52.140" style="s2">people but mean by whiteness how did</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.380" end="00:59:54.490" style="s2">white attitudes change or not change</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.140" end="00:59:56.050" style="s2">what is the relationship between systems</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.490" end="00:59:58.090" style="s2">and culture and what is the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.050" end="00:59:59.950" style="s2">relationship between culture and success</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.090" end="01:00:01.150" style="s2">in black America then we can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.950" end="01:00:03.070" style="s2">build out something that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.150" end="01:00:05.290" style="s2">coherent that can bring in a coalition</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.070" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">behind it so I wouldn&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.290" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s it I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:14.710" style="s2">interesting proposal but in my mind it</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:17.610" style="s2">actually underscores the degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.710" end="01:00:20.920" style="s2">race actually pollutes so many things</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.610" end="01:00:23.140" style="s2">and the degree to which the aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.920" end="01:00:26.020" style="s2">to make progress on all of these really</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.140" end="01:00:30.340" style="s2">really important incredibly complicated</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.020" end="01:00:33.850" style="s2">problems is compounded by the flattening</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.340" end="01:00:36.550" style="s2">that the indication of race requires the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.850" end="01:00:38.560" style="s2">the thinking about groups the thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.550" end="01:00:40.660" style="s2">about culpability as something that can</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.560" end="01:00:42.280" style="s2">be ascribed to one group or another the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.660" end="01:00:44.080" style="s2">thinking about dysfunction is something</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.280" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">that can be ascribed to an entire group</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.080" end="01:00:48.310" style="s2">the reality is that there are particular</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:50.080" style="s2">behaviors perhaps even particular paths</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.310" end="01:00:52.450" style="s2">ologies that we want to address and</p>

<p begin="01:04:40.470" end="01:04:45.280" style="s2">that we are tearing each other apart</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.700" end="01:04:47.890" style="s2">what are the areas of scarcity that we</p>

<p begin="01:04:47.890" end="01:04:53.020" style="s2">otherwise to help heal that and I do</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.080" end="01:04:56.620" style="s2">agree that this exists across the board</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.020" end="01:04:59.770" style="s2">and this is not merely a matter of a</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.770" end="01:05:05.530" style="s2">add one bit of nuance what I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.770" end="01:05:08.350" style="s2">for is that we have an artificially high</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.350" end="01:05:12.010" style="s2">been hoarded the bad luck is more</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.360" end="01:05:13.630" style="s2">widespread than it should be and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.010" end="01:05:15.850" style="s2">disproportionately falls on some</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.630" end="01:05:17.860" style="s2">communities more than others so it&#39;s non</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.850" end="01:05:19.300" style="s2">randomly distributed which causes the</p>

<p begin="01:07:56.480" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">is the the the villains are self defined</p>

<p begin="01:08:35.820" end="01:08:38.730" style="s2">problem is that the people who talk</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.260" end="01:08:41.880" style="s2">about this the most and that the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.730" end="01:08:44.760" style="s2">authority are highly unlikely to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.880" end="01:08:45.840" style="s2">that clinical a view of this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.760" end="01:08:47.400" style="s2">thing because there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.840" end="01:08:51.240" style="s2">different cultural problem which is that</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.850" end="01:09:07.050" style="s2">makes you special and so that means that</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.650" end="01:09:08.610" style="s2">even if the opportunity here were</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.050" end="01:09:10.980" style="s2">offered and Chloe I&#39;m with you to an</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.610" end="01:09:12.810" style="s2">expense on reparation I get it</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.980" end="01:09:15.540" style="s2">I see it as you know there is very</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.810" end="01:09:17.400" style="s2">similar to the Japanese case my feelings</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.540" end="01:09:19.350" style="s2">always been reparations and before and</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.400" end="01:09:20.790" style="s2">not too much happened but I could get on</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.350" end="01:09:23.730" style="s2">board with the idea that we do it again</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.790" end="01:09:26.580" style="s2">but the problem is that the kinds of</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.480" end="01:09:36.060" style="s2">they would see it as their</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.680" end="01:09:44.430" style="s2">she&#39;s in the news a lot lately and</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.180" end="01:09:45.660" style="s2">because she really gets around I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.170" end="01:09:54.330" style="s2">reparations were granted think about</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.050" end="01:10:14.010" style="s2">of it but that facial expression is G</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.150" end="01:10:17.850" style="s2">often ads which is kind of similar to</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.460" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">interviewing her in say five years after</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.770" end="01:10:27.730" style="s2">reparations happen with her having a</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.260" style="s2">different facial expression and because</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.730" end="01:10:30.760" style="s2">this is gonna seem like I&#39;m attacking a</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.260" end="01:10:32.469" style="s2">woman I will say the same thing about</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.760" end="01:10:34.690" style="s2">Tom Hoshi coats think about his facial</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.469" end="01:10:36.580" style="s2">expression in interviews the facial</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.690" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">expression think there&#39;s a reason you</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.580" end="01:10:40.420" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine it ever changing there</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:43.660" style="s2">would always be that sense that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.420" end="01:10:45.640" style="s2">battle is still on and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.660" end="01:10:47.380" style="s2">that kind of person has such an</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.640" end="01:10:49.210" style="s2">influence that I think we need to look</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.380" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">at more than just these cold figures</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.210" end="01:10:52.420" style="s2">that you Brett the biologist</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.680" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">understandably are trying to see these</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.420" end="01:10:57.160" style="s2">things because the people who talk about</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:59.200" style="s2">this with influence will never be</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.160" end="01:11:01.750" style="s2">placated including if reparations were</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.200" end="01:11:05.680" style="s2">granted I think that actually coats</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.750" end="01:11:08.590" style="s2">coats just changed since he got really</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.680" end="01:11:10.540" style="s2">paid and he&#39;s an optimist now yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.590" end="01:11:12.280" style="s2">going to say cold coats is actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.540" end="01:11:13.900" style="s2">interesting because he you know when</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.280" end="01:11:16.690" style="s2">Obama was in office he had this very</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.900" end="01:11:18.370" style="s2">long interview with him in the Atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.690" end="01:11:19.719" style="s2">magazine about reparations where Obama</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.370" end="01:11:21.430" style="s2">was specifically saying he actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.719" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for reparations and just the fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.430" end="01:11:23.530" style="s2">that he was able to have that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:25.780" style="s2">conversation with him without</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.530" end="01:11:28.840" style="s2">necessarily it was in print but without</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.780" end="01:11:30.850" style="s2">that sort of very rigid you know facial</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.840" end="01:11:32.830" style="s2">expression I think is maybe telling but</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.850" end="01:11:36.520" style="s2">I think the larger question would be so</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.830" end="01:11:40.390" style="s2">how do we disincentivize that kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.520" end="01:11:41.680" style="s2">response culturally and I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.390" end="01:11:43.930" style="s2">possible because I do think we have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.680" end="01:11:45.730" style="s2">you know you might not like the term</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.930" end="01:11:49.090" style="s2">influencers but I do think we actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.730" end="01:11:51.300" style="s2">have a lot of influencers culturally in</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.090" end="01:11:54.219" style="s2">the black community that are that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.300" end="01:11:56.020" style="s2">willing and able to have a much more</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.219" end="01:11:58.630" style="s2">nuanced conversation about this I</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.020" end="01:12:00.670" style="s2">brought this up at a talk that Glenn you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.630" end="01:12:02.680" style="s2">are at it at the Manhattan Institute two</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.670" end="01:12:04.150" style="s2">years ago when I talked spoke about The</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.680" end="01:12:09.969" style="s2">Breakfast Club for all of its problems</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.150" end="01:12:14.050" style="s2">and a husband that was you there are you</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.969" end="01:12:15.750" style="s2">know there are serious conversations of</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.050" end="01:12:18.310" style="s2">the caliber that we&#39;re having right now</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.750" end="01:12:20.260" style="s2">from influential folks and the black</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.310" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">community that talk about the problems</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.260" end="01:12:23.770" style="s2">with our culture that talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:25.390" style="s2">proliferation of violence that talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.770" end="01:12:28.600" style="s2">about the proliferation of incarceration</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.390" end="01:12:30.700" style="s2">as caused by us and so this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.600" end="01:12:32.860" style="s2">there is just none of that happening and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.700" end="01:12:34.749" style="s2">that we can&#39;t somehow incentivize that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.860" end="01:12:37.869" style="s2">just think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.749" end="01:12:39.939" style="s2">laid out by the facts so again my</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.869" end="01:12:41.289" style="s2">question and I agree with you John but</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.939" end="01:12:43.689" style="s2">my question would be then how do we</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.289" end="01:12:45.459" style="s2">distance sensitize that from happening</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.689" end="01:12:46.570" style="s2">and maybe maybe come up I saw you</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.459" end="01:12:50.409" style="s2">shaking your head maybe you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.570" end="01:12:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s possible but I do so but I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.409" end="01:12:53.739" style="s2">love to hear you guys his thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.880" end="01:12:56.110" style="s2">that yeah I mean Chloe is asking the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.739" end="01:12:57.550" style="s2">right question that is the question that</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.110" end="01:12:59.469" style="s2">highlights the limitation of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.550" end="01:13:01.689" style="s2">conversation that we&#39;ve been having up</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.469" end="01:13:03.880" style="s2">to the moment Brett I think that your</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.689" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">frame about the hoarding of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.880" end="01:13:08.439" style="s2">being a major major part of what leads</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.880" end="01:13:10.419" style="s2">to the cultural and other issues that</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.439" end="01:13:12.639" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing I think that&#39;s spot-on I</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.419" end="01:13:14.619" style="s2">feel like that overlaps with my analysis</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.639" end="01:13:16.989" style="s2">in the analysis that others are are</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.619" end="01:13:19.780" style="s2">giving here but I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.989" end="01:13:22.989" style="s2">communicative potential of that analysis</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.780" end="01:13:25.419" style="s2">is only made viable if it is deployed</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.989" end="01:13:27.550" style="s2">within a larger context that begins to</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.419" end="01:13:29.800" style="s2">sort of address the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.550" end="01:13:31.300" style="s2">intercultural and cultural internal</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.800" end="01:13:34.030" style="s2">cultural conversations that are already</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.300" end="01:13:35.949" style="s2">taking place right because Glenn and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.030" end="01:13:37.329" style="s2">John and in in different ways you guys</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.949" end="01:13:39.280" style="s2">are both sort of highlighting the fact</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.329" end="01:13:41.469" style="s2">that the empirical arguments are just</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.280" end="01:13:43.929" style="s2">not enough right and so if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.469" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">talk about what does a solution look</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.929" end="01:13:47.590" style="s2">like from moving the community for it it</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:49.510" style="s2">can&#39;t be a conversation</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.340" end="01:16:17.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken from this conversation for</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.810" end="01:16:20.340" style="s2">the last 15 minutes critical</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.970" end="01:16:23.070" style="s2">institutions mattering the universities</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.230" end="01:16:44.180" style="s2">universities is absolutely critical so</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.870" end="01:16:50.580" style="s2">the press is absolutely critical I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.390" end="01:16:52.590" style="s2">appalled sometimes when I pick up the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.580" end="01:16:54.870" style="s2">newspaper and I look at the tin ditches</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.590" end="01:16:57.180" style="s2">way within which he myths that are very</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.870" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">complicated are framed and simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.180" end="01:17:03.420" style="s2">black and white racial kind of framing</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:05.550" style="s2">so anyway I just want to make my point</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.420" end="01:17:12.059" style="s2">take it as a footnote John would to your</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.550" end="01:17:17.550" style="s2">long disposition before you jump in come</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.059" end="01:17:20.639" style="s2">on go ahead well I just want to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.550" end="01:17:22.409" style="s2">before you jump in very frequently we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.639" end="01:17:24.119" style="s2">got a problem we&#39;ve got two things that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.409" end="01:17:28.019" style="s2">have been fused together in our minds</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.119" end="01:17:29.880" style="s2">and they have to be pulled apart in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.019" end="01:17:31.530" style="s2">case is it the pointy-headed</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.880" end="01:17:33.900" style="s2">intellectual discussion that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.530" end="01:17:36.900" style="s2">had or is it the visceral narrative</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.900" end="01:17:38.489" style="s2">thing obviously it&#39;s both you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.900" end="01:17:40.709" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s actually going on but</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.489" end="01:17:43.320" style="s2">the only way it&#39;s gonna reach anybody is</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.709" end="01:17:44.820" style="s2">if you get it into poetry or music or</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.320" end="01:17:47.849" style="s2">narrative or something like this which</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.820" end="01:17:50.010" style="s2">is obviously Chloe&#39;s specialty so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.849" end="01:17:51.449" style="s2">I&#39;m not arguing let&#39;s get this</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.010" end="01:17:52.769" style="s2">intellectually right and then share the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.449" end="01:17:54.989" style="s2">good news because nobody&#39;s gonna listen</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.769" end="01:17:56.849" style="s2">but if we didn&#39;t get it intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.989" end="01:17:58.139" style="s2">right and then figure out how to say it</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.849" end="01:18:00.300" style="s2">so that people understand actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.139" end="01:18:02.639" style="s2">there&#39;s hope down some road other than</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.300" end="01:18:04.110" style="s2">attacking the nuclear family and taking</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.639" end="01:18:06.690" style="s2">apart stem and all of this other</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.110" end="01:18:08.369" style="s2">nonsense then you know maybe we can go</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.690" end="01:18:12.090" style="s2">in a good direction all right correct</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.369" end="01:18:16.709" style="s2">yeah Brett I&#39;m curious how you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.090" end="01:18:22.170" style="s2">the case that our racial tensions are</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.709" end="01:18:25.650" style="s2">caused by a as you put an artificial</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.170" end="01:18:27.479" style="s2">scarcity and the implication being if if</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.650" end="01:18:30.329" style="s2">there were more opportunity our racial</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.479" end="01:18:31.679" style="s2">tensions would lessen I&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.329" end="01:18:33.150" style="s2">of that I think it might be too</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.679" end="01:18:36.420" style="s2">optimistic how do you know that</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.150" end="01:18:39.360" style="s2">well a this phone calls pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.420" end="01:18:40.320" style="s2">demonstration all right we&#39;re doing all</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.360" end="01:18:42.659" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.320" end="01:18:44.639" style="s2">but so is the New York Times op-ed page</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.659" end="01:18:46.949" style="s2">so are all the college-educated black</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.639" end="01:18:48.929" style="s2">activists class that that is at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.949" end="01:18:50.849" style="s2">forefront of the misunderstandings oh no</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.929" end="01:18:52.709" style="s2">no no that&#39;s not what I mean by doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.849" end="01:18:54.570" style="s2">all right I mean that we are reaching</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.709" end="01:18:56.519" style="s2">each other hearing each other making</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.570" end="01:18:58.229" style="s2">points concessions all of the things</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.519" end="01:19:03.449" style="s2">that are necessary for people to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.229" end="01:19:05.610" style="s2">collaborate in a non race first way but</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.449" end="01:19:09.570" style="s2">let me let me flip the thing on its head</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.610" end="01:19:12.909" style="s2">because yours there okay let me just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.570" end="01:19:15.729" style="s2">gonna go the analytical rap for a second</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.909" end="01:19:19.209" style="s2">until the last five minutes of history</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.729" end="01:19:21.849" style="s2">there was only lineage against lineage</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.209" end="01:19:23.619" style="s2">competition right people competed with</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.849" end="01:19:27.039" style="s2">each other on the basis of who was</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.619" end="01:19:30.389" style="s2">related to whom there there is another</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.039" end="01:19:33.459" style="s2">mechanism that unfolds which is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.389" end="01:19:35.169" style="s2">collaboration based on reciprocity right</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.459" end="01:19:37.300" style="s2">where one puts aside relatedness and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.169" end="01:19:39.099" style="s2">collaborates based on the fact that it</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.300" end="01:19:40.389" style="s2">is profitable to both parties to engage</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.099" end="01:19:43.119" style="s2">in collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.389" end="01:19:46.269" style="s2">now that has ancient roots but at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.119" end="01:19:48.729" style="s2">level of the scale of Nations in general</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.269" end="01:19:50.709" style="s2">you have a closely related population</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.729" end="01:19:52.300" style="s2">inside of a border and it may compete</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.709" end="01:19:53.889" style="s2">with a different population across some</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.300" end="01:19:55.179" style="s2">other border or sometimes they&#39;re within</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.889" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">one border and you&#39;ll end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.179" end="01:19:59.679" style="s2">genocide every now and again but a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:01.689" style="s2">structure that attempts to stabilize our</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.679" end="01:20:05.349" style="s2">collaborative instincts with each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.689" end="01:20:08.530" style="s2">and sideline our lineage level</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.349" end="01:20:10.599" style="s2">relatedness questions is novel what we</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.530" end="01:20:12.249" style="s2">know is that it can work because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.599" end="01:20:14.229" style="s2">best moments in our history it has</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.249" end="01:20:16.539" style="s2">worked and in fact you can see that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.229" end="01:20:18.189" style="s2">moments of productivity are ones in</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.539" end="01:20:20.229" style="s2">which we actually make progress on this</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.189" end="01:20:22.059" style="s2">front and then you get a contraction and</p>

<p begin="01:21:17.980" end="01:21:22.090" style="s2">really I mean I agree with many of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.630" end="01:21:23.830" style="s2">points you made but I&#39;m so like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.090" end="01:21:25.720" style="s2">looking for is like this seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.830" end="01:21:27.820" style="s2">very interesting hypothesis to me which</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.720" end="01:21:29.230" style="s2">is that what we think our racial</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.820" end="01:21:31.060" style="s2">tensions are actually caused by</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.230" end="01:21:32.410" style="s2">something totally different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.060" end="01:21:34.810" style="s2">something I&#39;ve actually heard a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.410" end="01:21:36.370" style="s2">activists say that they want us to fight</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.810" end="01:21:37.540" style="s2">each other because if we&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.370" end="01:21:39.970" style="s2">each other then we&#39;re not fighting them</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.540" end="01:21:41.830" style="s2">or them is defined as like you know the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.970" end="01:21:43.630" style="s2">the 1% it&#39;s something actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.830" end="01:21:46.120" style="s2">Marxists think they think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.630" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">racial issues are actually just class</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.120" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">issues in disguise and if we solve the</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:53.620" style="s2">former the latter will at minimum be</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:55.090" style="s2">lessened and I&#39;m I&#39;m curious whether</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.620" end="01:21:56.620" style="s2">it&#39;s true like have we looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.090" end="01:21:58.360" style="s2">past hundred years of history and seeing</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.620" end="01:22:01.120" style="s2">that when when race relations are worse</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.360" end="01:22:03.370" style="s2">it&#39;s always during economic downturns or</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.120" end="01:22:05.110" style="s2">that like how we&#39;ve done a rigorous that</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.370" end="01:22:06.700" style="s2">this this is a kind of thing that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.110" end="01:22:08.260" style="s2">like it might be true but it also just</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.700" end="01:22:10.210" style="s2">might be might not be true so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.260" end="01:22:12.700" style="s2">looking for like the rigorous evidence</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.210" end="01:22:15.010" style="s2">and well so first of all let&#39;s if we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.700" end="01:22:16.450" style="s2">take this out of the American context</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.010" end="01:22:19.000" style="s2">for a second and actually take it out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.450" end="01:22:22.210" style="s2">the black context as well think about</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.000" end="01:22:25.930" style="s2">anti-semitism right anti-semitism is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.210" end="01:22:30.040" style="s2">recurrent theme in history why have you</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.930" end="01:22:32.350" style="s2">ever heard an explanation from Thomas</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.040" end="01:22:34.090" style="s2">Sowell his middle man minority that</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.350" end="01:22:35.950" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand what they bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.090" end="01:22:38.380" style="s2">economically and resent them it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.950" end="01:22:41.200" style="s2">pretty pretty persuasive to me but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.380" end="01:22:42.700" style="s2">haven&#39;t studied it rigorously well here</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.200" end="01:22:43.990" style="s2">would be my argument I think his</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.700" end="01:22:46.120" style="s2">argument is right but that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.990" end="01:22:50.620" style="s2">deeper level and the deeper level is</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.120" end="01:22:52.000" style="s2">this Jews live as part of a diaspora it</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.620" end="01:22:54.370" style="s2">means that we&#39;re a minority population</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.000" end="01:22:57.310" style="s2">inside the borders of other nations and</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.370" end="01:22:59.500" style="s2">when times are good people collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.310" end="01:23:02.980" style="s2">with us when times are bad they find an</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.500" end="01:23:04.450" style="s2">excuse to eliminate us or to steal stuff</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.980" end="01:23:06.130" style="s2">from us not because there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.450" end="01:23:09.010" style="s2">justification for this but because it</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.130" end="01:23:10.930" style="s2">creates growth for the population in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.010" end="01:23:12.370" style="s2">position to do the stealing and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.930" end="01:23:13.750" style="s2">population that&#39;s in a position to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.370" end="01:23:16.690" style="s2">the stealing is the majority population</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.750" end="01:23:20.380" style="s2">by its very nature so all I&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.690" end="01:23:22.120" style="s2">is when times are good one can afford to</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.380" end="01:23:25.120" style="s2">collaborate because it&#39;s not a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.120" end="01:23:27.010" style="s2">game it&#39;s a positive sum game as things</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.120" end="01:23:30.610" style="s2">go into zero-sum or worse</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.010" end="01:23:32.530" style="s2">negative-sum you can actually create the</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.610" end="01:23:34.659" style="s2">appearance of growth to one population</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.530" end="01:23:36.579" style="s2">by robbing a different one and in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.659" end="01:23:39.309" style="s2">sense what&#39;s going on in the u.s. is</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.579" end="01:23:42.730" style="s2">that the black population is continually</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.309" end="01:23:44.199" style="s2">being robbed right and so the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.730" end="01:23:47.079" style="s2">I&#39;m having trouble with is I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.199" end="01:23:49.300" style="s2">this movement and it is motivated by</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.079" end="01:23:51.579" style="s2">something that I think is very very real</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.300" end="01:23:53.710" style="s2">but it has misdiagnosed it and because</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.579" end="01:23:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s misdiagnosed it&#39;s about to botch</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.710" end="01:23:57.969" style="s2">the policy level and in fact it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.570" end="01:23:59.949" style="s2">botch the policy level in a way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.969" end="01:24:01.900" style="s2">gonna take down the entire experiment</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.949" end="01:24:04.809" style="s2">rather than doing something that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.900" end="01:24:07.960" style="s2">positively address the real issue that</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.809" end="01:24:09.789" style="s2">has caused the anger which obviously has</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.960" end="01:24:12.010" style="s2">a racial nature but isn&#39;t entirely</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.789" end="01:24:15.010" style="s2">racial right people are suffering in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.010" end="01:24:16.769" style="s2">very general way so again I feel like I</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.010" end="01:24:19.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t perfectly answered your question</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.769" end="01:24:21.369" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t wanna I don&#39;t want to take</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.570" end="01:24:24.250" style="s2">up too much time but the the Federal</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.250" end="01:24:28.989" style="s2">his economic well-being report it pulls</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.139" end="01:24:31.079" style="s2">Americans and asked them are you doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.989" end="01:24:33.369" style="s2">better financially than your parents and</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.079" end="01:24:35.860" style="s2">something like seventy percent of black</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.369" end="01:24:37.929" style="s2">people answered that question yes and</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.860" end="01:24:41.260" style="s2">that that percentage was higher than for</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.929" end="01:24:44.829" style="s2">them for whites and I feel I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.260" end="01:24:47.199" style="s2">I I&#39;m not sure I buy the idea that this</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.829" end="01:24:48.610" style="s2">is a I think this is its own problem is</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.199" end="01:24:51.039" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying I think it&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.610" end="01:24:55.239" style="s2">that&#39;s generated by ideas by social</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.039" end="01:24:57.880" style="s2">media by you know selected by by</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.239" end="01:25:02.710" style="s2">coverage bias covering certain instances</p>

<p begin="01:25:02.710" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">analysis might be too optimistic in</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.539" end="01:25:10.090" style="s2">pinning it as a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.639" end="01:25:11.920" style="s2">other problem well here&#39;s a very quick</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.090" end="01:25:13.690" style="s2">thing breath yeah I I would have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.920" end="01:25:15.760" style="s2">agree with Coleman here in that I</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.690" end="01:25:18.070" style="s2">suggest a heuristic I say this all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.760" end="01:25:20.530" style="s2">time on the Glenn show but I think this</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.070" end="01:25:22.599" style="s2">is important whatever you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.530" end="01:25:24.070" style="s2">come up with about race problem whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.599" end="01:25:26.019" style="s2">analysis you&#39;re trying you have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.070" end="01:25:28.599" style="s2">always keep in mind this very simple</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.019" end="01:25:31.659" style="s2">thing every summer in big cities across</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.599" end="01:25:33.250" style="s2">the United States black teenagers and</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.659" end="01:25:36.309" style="s2">twenty-somethings start killing each</p>

<p begin="01:25:40.360" end="01:25:46.090" style="s2">or opportunity or who has more of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.180" end="01:25:47.770" style="s2">chips the question has to be why that</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.090" end="01:25:49.510" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think anybody would say</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.770" end="01:25:51.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you would say that those</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.510" end="01:25:53.800" style="s2">boys are killing one another because</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.970" end="01:25:56.110" style="s2">they don&#39;t have enough to eat because</p>

<p begin="01:25:56.110" end="01:26:00.330" style="s2">there&#39;s something more going on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.480" end="01:26:02.710" style="s2">not to say that these are ethological</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.330" end="01:26:05.080" style="s2">individuals there are there reasons for</p>

<p begin="01:26:05.080" end="01:26:10.120" style="s2">stop this but what&#39;s going on among many</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.990" end="01:26:11.980" style="s2">other things is that and so your</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.120" end="01:26:14.590" style="s2">analysis has to cover that well of</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.980" end="01:26:16.540" style="s2">course it does and I mean look there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:26:18.220" end="01:26:21.610" style="s2">for one thing I don&#39;t think very much</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.780" end="01:26:22.930" style="s2">depends on the precision of it right</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.610" end="01:26:25.750" style="s2">which I think is what we&#39;re arguing</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.930" end="01:26:28.960" style="s2">about the question is is it is it in the</p>

<p begin="01:26:28.960" end="01:26:34.690" style="s2">that so much of this is deep enough that</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.290" end="01:26:36.370" style="s2">the solution is not quick there is</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.370" end="01:26:39.760" style="s2">would solve this in less than a</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.930" end="01:26:42.010" style="s2">generation you could start to make it</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.760" end="01:26:43.660" style="s2">better very quickly but you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.010" end="01:26:46.420" style="s2">can&#39;t solve this because the problem</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.660" end="01:26:48.340" style="s2">does involve a failure of the culture of</p>

<p begin="01:26:50.830" end="01:26:56.980" style="s2">it right you have to resurrect a respect</p>

<p begin="01:27:01.240" end="01:27:06.700" style="s2">the question is if people don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.600" end="01:27:09.250" style="s2">there is a way for them to get ahead by</p>

<p begin="01:27:09.250" end="01:27:17.500" style="s2">engage in it and so there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.090" end="01:27:20.710" style="s2">something to shoot for and that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.500" end="01:27:24.850" style="s2">too that&#39;s quite it is it is it your is</p>

<p begin="01:27:30.640" end="01:27:35.020" style="s2">this deficit of opportunity is it a</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.040" end="01:27:36.850" style="s2">function of just lower productivity</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.020" end="01:27:39.700" style="s2">during the period that we find ourselves</p>

<p begin="01:27:39.700" end="01:27:45.250" style="s2">that there is something that is broken</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.030" end="01:27:46.960" style="s2">because certainly when I look at when I</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.250" end="01:27:49.810" style="s2">look under the hood of what we call</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.960" end="01:27:52.240" style="s2">black America and we look at the various</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.810" end="01:27:54.070" style="s2">cohorts that exist there the different</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.240" end="01:27:57.070" style="s2">immigrant communities there</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.070" end="01:27:59.469" style="s2">lots of successful people there and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.070" end="01:28:02.199" style="s2">think that&#39;s also true across the United</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.469" end="01:28:04.150" style="s2">States when you tick off certain boxes</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.199" end="01:28:07.300" style="s2">and when you have certain</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.150" end="01:28:09.159" style="s2">characteristics you actually tend to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.300" end="01:28:11.679" style="s2">pretty well in this country and you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.159" end="01:28:13.060" style="s2">have attained some of that upward</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">mobility</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.060" end="01:28:17.770" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there are things</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:19.869" style="s2">certainly prior to the pandemic that</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.770" end="01:28:22.510" style="s2">we&#39;re working there are other things</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.869" end="01:28:24.520" style="s2">that weren&#39;t working and you know one</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.510" end="01:28:27.119" style="s2">concern that I have is is the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.520" end="01:28:31.510" style="s2">which we imagine that that we can</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.119" end="01:28:33.579" style="s2">engineer the better political systems</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.510" end="01:28:36.010" style="s2">that will give us better societal</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.579" end="01:28:38.409" style="s2">outcomes and I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.010" end="01:28:40.900" style="s2">political fixes like the affirmative</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.409" end="01:28:43.420" style="s2">ones that that we often imagine putting</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.900" end="01:28:46.449" style="s2">into place to try and uplift people out</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.420" end="01:28:50.139" style="s2">of poverty and to to better distribute</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.449" end="01:28:52.449" style="s2">opportunity they tend to fail in ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.139" end="01:28:55.030" style="s2">that are pretty profound and for reasons</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.449" end="01:28:57.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand because the</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.030" end="01:29:01.570" style="s2">mechanisms that actually allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.040" end="01:29:04.270" style="s2">create prosperity her there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.570" end="01:29:08.349" style="s2">distributed and they&#39;re very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.270" end="01:29:09.849" style="s2">to actually try and game and they&#39;re way</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.349" end="01:29:13.270" style="s2">too complicated for most of us to</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.849" end="01:29:15.780" style="s2">actually understand well so this I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.270" end="01:29:18.130" style="s2">is where this dynamic between</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.780" end="01:29:20.409" style="s2">conservatives who tend to favor personal</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.130" end="01:29:23.250" style="s2">responsibility solutions and liberals</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.409" end="01:29:28.540" style="s2">who tend to favor systemic solutions</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.250" end="01:29:32.469" style="s2">tends to to to go awry because there is</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.540" end="01:29:36.040" style="s2">clearly if I was advising somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.469" end="01:29:38.619" style="s2">was in an oppressed population I would</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.040" end="01:29:41.170" style="s2">be full-time on the personal</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.619" end="01:29:43.329" style="s2">responsibility issue right why because</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.170" end="01:29:45.520" style="s2">you have a very good chance of improving</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.329" end="01:29:47.530" style="s2">your well-being by being personally</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.520" end="01:29:49.630" style="s2">responsible whether it&#39;s fair or not you</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.530" end="01:29:51.099" style="s2">have a very good chance of getting out</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.630" end="01:29:52.599" style="s2">of your situation if you can keep your</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.099" end="01:29:53.860" style="s2">head down and do the right sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.599" end="01:29:56.050" style="s2">things so if I was advising an</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.860" end="01:29:58.659" style="s2">individual that&#39;s the only game in town</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.050" end="01:30:01.300" style="s2">the problem is if it doesn&#39;t adjust how</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.659" end="01:30:03.309" style="s2">much there is available then if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.300" end="01:30:05.650" style="s2">succeed through personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.309" end="01:30:07.630" style="s2">somebody else fails somebody whose name</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.650" end="01:30:09.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t know right and so my</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.630" end="01:30:11.650" style="s2">point would be it&#39;s not one or the other</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.610" end="01:30:14.020" style="s2">in this case from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.650" end="01:30:16.120" style="s2">individuals we don&#39;t want this D</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.020" end="01:30:19.989" style="s2">individuated anti-racist movement that</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.120" end="01:30:22.389" style="s2">basically turns people into you know at</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.989" end="01:30:24.489" style="s2">just of a mob we want people to</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.389" end="01:30:26.620" style="s2">recognize themselves as individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.489" end="01:30:29.500" style="s2">to recognize that they have agency and</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.620" end="01:30:31.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s important but to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.500" end="01:30:34.179" style="s2">that the problem is at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.810" end="01:30:37.270" style="s2">day if there is enough to go around it</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.179" end="01:30:38.679" style="s2">isn&#39;t available to most people that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.270" end="01:30:42.070" style="s2">issue to be addressed at a different</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.679" end="01:30:45.310" style="s2">level and I am NOT I was decades ago a</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.070" end="01:30:47.230" style="s2">believer in these architected top-down</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.310" end="01:30:48.340" style="s2">solutions I am no longer a believer in</p>

<p begin="01:30:48.340" end="01:30:53.590" style="s2">advocating but I am advocating that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.500" end="01:30:55.989" style="s2">recognized a degree to which bad luck</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.590" end="01:30:57.610" style="s2">for example is non randomly distributed</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.989" end="01:31:00.340" style="s2">and we say look that&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.610" end="01:31:02.290" style="s2">unacceptable phenomenon right it is our</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.340" end="01:31:04.320" style="s2">obligation there&#39;s gonna be bad luck but</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.290" end="01:31:06.610" style="s2">it should be evenly distributed based on</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.320" end="01:31:08.290" style="s2">race and zip code and all of these</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.610" end="01:31:09.699" style="s2">things and until it is we&#39;ve got a</p>

<p begin="01:31:50.110" end="01:31:55.060" style="s2">conversation is I think key and I want</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.320" end="01:31:58.330" style="s2">to tell you a very brief story I was on</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.060" end="01:32:00.100" style="s2">a subway in Harlem last time I was in</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.330" end="01:32:05.010" style="s2">New York and there was a group of kids</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.100" end="01:32:07.659" style="s2">they must been 13 14 years old</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.010" end="01:32:10.090" style="s2">seemed like interesting good kids</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.659" end="01:32:13.090" style="s2">they were black and they were horsing</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.090" end="01:32:15.320" style="s2">around on the train and one of the kids</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.090" end="01:32:19.220" style="s2">a girl</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.320" end="01:32:21.290" style="s2">sort of looked a bit bookish and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.220" end="01:32:23.480" style="s2">other kids that she was with took her</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.290" end="01:32:26.330" style="s2">knapsack and they started making fun of</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.480" end="01:32:28.130" style="s2">her for studying and giving a damn about</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.330" end="01:32:30.920" style="s2">school and they literally turned her</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.130" end="01:32:32.960" style="s2">backpack upside down and spilled out her</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.920" end="01:32:34.640" style="s2">notes just spilled out across the floor</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.960" end="01:32:36.440" style="s2">of the Train and she was embarrassed</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.640" end="01:32:38.570" style="s2">picking them back up because it</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.440" end="01:32:41.720" style="s2">demonstrated that she gave a damn right</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.570" end="01:32:43.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a deep problem right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.720" end="01:32:45.860" style="s2">serious problem because it means that</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.370" end="01:32:47.720" style="s2">even somebody who is interested in the</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.340" end="01:40:19.449" style="s2">thought of frighten us all but I agree</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.189" end="01:40:20.679" style="s2">with you completely about what you said</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.449" end="01:40:22.239" style="s2">about school what I should have said is</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.679" end="01:40:23.679" style="s2">we know how to make better schools we</p>

<p begin="01:40:23.679" end="01:40:27.699" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that we figure it</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.090" end="01:40:29.679" style="s2">out and it should look radically</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.699" end="01:40:32.489" style="s2">different but then I say something bread</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.679" end="01:40:35.320" style="s2">just quickly I&#39;m struck by the contrast</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.489" end="01:40:37.329" style="s2">so there are two big areas of public</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.320" end="01:40:39.670" style="s2">service provision which have massive</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.329" end="01:40:43.510" style="s2">impacts on black communities its</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.670" end="01:40:45.189" style="s2">policing and education both of which are</p>

<p begin="01:40:46.959" end="01:40:51.579" style="s2">and both of which it could be argued and</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.090" end="01:40:54.280" style="s2">failed the community look at the</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.579" end="01:40:56.229" style="s2">discourse within the community about the</p>

<p begin="01:41:09.050" end="01:41:16.730" style="s2">you have the left-of-center politics</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.139" end="01:41:18.610" style="s2">implacably opposed to doing what Camille</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.730" end="01:41:21.710" style="s2">Foster just said needed to be done</p>

<p begin="01:41:24.860" end="01:41:30.230" style="s2">interest my point is about us where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.739" end="01:41:34.699" style="s2">the criticism of that for people who</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.230" end="01:41:37.280" style="s2">think that black lives matter can you</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.699" end="01:41:40.070" style="s2">say what exactly the criticism what is</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.280" end="01:41:43.159" style="s2">that in that sense that is the failure</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.070" end="01:41:46.429" style="s2">of conventional public educational</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.159" end="01:41:49.159" style="s2">services being provided to black people</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.429" end="01:41:51.860" style="s2">to convey to them the opportunity in</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.159" end="01:41:54.679" style="s2">this life to which they are entitled so</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.860" end="01:41:57.110" style="s2">this is why which can be remedied</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.679" end="01:41:59.540" style="s2">Camille suggests by expanding</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.110" end="01:42:02.210" style="s2">educational choice which policy is</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.540" end="01:42:05.389" style="s2">implacably opposed by the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.210" end="01:42:07.280" style="s2">Party so I believe the problem is both</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.389" end="01:42:09.770" style="s2">parties that the parties have</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.280" end="01:42:12.020" style="s2">effectively got a stranglehold on power</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.770" end="01:42:14.599" style="s2">right and that stranglehold on power</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.020" end="01:42:18.409" style="s2">means that policy does not serve the</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.599" end="01:42:20.750" style="s2">public and it hasn&#39;t for decades so this</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.409" end="01:42:22.550" style="s2">is why I started where I did I believe</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.750" end="01:42:24.320" style="s2">if you were to get anywhere if Camille</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.550" end="01:42:26.030" style="s2">is right about what the solution</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.320" end="01:42:27.920" style="s2">actually looks like then what you need</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.030" end="01:42:29.570" style="s2">is a governmental structure that</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.920" end="01:42:31.670" style="s2">actually gives a damn what the</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.570" end="01:42:34.699" style="s2">consequences of its behavior are rather</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.670" end="01:42:36.739" style="s2">than parties that are cynically pointing</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.699" end="01:42:38.270" style="s2">us at each other so that we don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.739" end="01:42:40.550" style="s2">the corruption that they&#39;re involved in</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.270" end="01:42:43.190" style="s2">that I really think is ultimately the</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.550" end="01:42:44.750" style="s2">only route out of this because if we let</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.190" end="01:42:47.570" style="s2">the parties continue to play their role</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.750" end="01:42:54.860" style="s2">they&#39;re going to start a race war I mean</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.570" end="01:42:59.079" style="s2">very predictably no no because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.860" end="01:43:02.030" style="s2">not true no I think the Democrats are</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.079" end="01:43:03.949" style="s2">basically cynically toying with</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.030" end="01:43:05.900" style="s2">partnering with this so-called</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.949" end="01:43:07.699" style="s2">anti-racist movement and that that is</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.900" end="01:43:09.679" style="s2">going to back White&#39;s against the wall</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.699" end="01:43:11.750" style="s2">and cause them to start seeing things</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.679" end="01:43:13.550" style="s2">racially in a way that they haven&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.750" end="01:43:16.699" style="s2">more than a generation and that the net</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.550" end="01:43:18.349" style="s2">result of those two phenomena is that we</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.699" end="01:43:20.949" style="s2">are going to be headed to a conflict</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.349" end="01:43:23.139" style="s2">that nobody knows the way out of</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.949" end="01:43:26.699" style="s2">and what&#39;s more unlike our first civil</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.139" end="01:43:30.459" style="s2">war there&#39;s not even a geographic</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.699" end="01:43:32.559" style="s2">description of a solution right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.459" end="01:43:35.739" style="s2">about that because you have quite a lot</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.559" end="01:43:38.889" style="s2">of whites that are no longer interested</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.739" end="01:43:40.780" style="s2">or exhausted in their own identity who</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.889" end="01:43:42.699" style="s2">are not going to be taking up that war</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.780" end="01:43:44.949" style="s2">so it gets a lot more complicated than</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.699" end="01:43:47.050" style="s2">white respect I agree it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.949" end="01:43:50.739" style="s2">complicated but do you see a way that it</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.050" end="01:43:53.499" style="s2">ends acceptable I mean you have a</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.739" end="01:43:55.809" style="s2">well-armed rural white population that</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.499" end="01:43:58.150" style="s2">is now correctly understanding that it</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.809" end="01:43:59.739" style="s2">is being targeted by a mob that claims</p>

<p begin="01:46:02.850" end="01:46:06.630" style="s2">equitable in the sense that you at least</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.500" end="01:46:09.630" style="s2">you know you know you&#39;re getting a token</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.630" end="01:46:12.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s funded corporately by all of us</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.630" end="01:46:14.940" style="s2">and perhaps is consistent with the</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.239" end="01:46:16.350" style="s2">status quo but I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:46:19.110" end="01:46:24.510" style="s2">raving mad right but I do know that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.900" end="01:46:25.920" style="s2">way you would discover the solution is</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.510" end="01:46:27.600" style="s2">you would have to eliminate the</p>

<p begin="01:46:29.640" end="01:46:34.280" style="s2">you&#39;re making is on the table and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:46:34.280" end="01:46:41.070" style="s2">analytical so it is it is necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.390" end="01:46:43.080" style="s2">eliminate the corruption in order to</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.070" end="01:46:44.969" style="s2">figure out how much we know about what</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.080" end="01:46:48.989" style="s2">to do and to discover that which we</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.969" end="01:46:50.730" style="s2">don&#39;t yet know so that&#39;s really my point</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.989" end="01:46:53.460" style="s2">is it&#39;s the corruption that is causing</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.730" end="01:46:53.969" style="s2">the problem and until we deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.460" end="01:46:56.909" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.969" end="01:47:00.390" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how much solution making</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.909" end="01:47:02.130" style="s2">is readily possible I&#39;m sorry they&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.390" end="01:47:04.219" style="s2">but are we thinking of concluding soon</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.130" end="01:47:06.960" style="s2">because I only allow two hours for this</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.219" end="01:47:11.550" style="s2">I think we have to do that do people</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.960" end="01:47:13.409" style="s2">have five more minutes yeah just I want</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.550" end="01:47:15.090" style="s2">to very briefly say I said st. Louis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.409" end="01:47:17.310" style="s2">in Kansas City for anybody who wants to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.090" end="01:47:19.530" style="s2">check up on that case thanks for the</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.310" end="01:47:21.300" style="s2">correction so how should we use the last</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.530" end="01:47:22.980" style="s2">five minutes I can talk about corruption</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.300" end="01:47:24.810" style="s2">and what I think we should do or we can</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.980" end="01:47:28.020" style="s2">continue the discussion and you guys can</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.810" end="01:47:31.770" style="s2">wrap up what you&#39;ve heard and what you</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.020" end="01:47:33.540" style="s2">think it means I just want to add to</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.770" end="01:47:35.550" style="s2">support what Camille just said I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.540" end="01:47:38.310" style="s2">sure that the corruption is merely top</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.550" end="01:47:41.100" style="s2">down in the sense that like I it could</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.310" end="01:47:46.199" style="s2">be that we the citizens have not we</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.100" end="01:47:48.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have this like internal feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.199" end="01:47:50.160" style="s2">actually do like</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.480" end="01:47:52.110" style="s2">fulfilling our duty as citizens and</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.160" end="01:47:54.360" style="s2">holding our politicians feet to the fire</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.110" end="01:47:58.140" style="s2">and so that pays that pick that plays a</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.360" end="01:47:59.520" style="s2">prominent role in terms of stopping the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.140" end="01:48:01.860" style="s2">corruption that you are referring to</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.520" end="01:48:04.520" style="s2">Brett and I and I that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.860" end="01:48:10.790" style="s2">that&#39;s easily solved</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.520" end="01:48:13.500" style="s2">who&#39;s up yeah my mind the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.790" end="01:48:17.250" style="s2">question with cultural question in terms</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.500" end="01:48:19.800" style="s2">of the larger narrative question really</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.250" end="01:48:22.530" style="s2">is what&#39;s what&#39;s key I mean Camille</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.800" end="01:48:23.970" style="s2">mentioned doctor dr. King the simple</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.530" end="01:48:26.100" style="s2">principle of us being judged by the</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.970" end="01:48:29.460" style="s2">content of our character but King</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.100" end="01:48:31.950" style="s2">engaged in a larger narrative project</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.460" end="01:48:33.750" style="s2">that challenged both the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.950" end="01:48:35.550" style="s2">coming from the races establishment but</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.750" end="01:48:37.770" style="s2">also the narrative coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.550" end="01:48:40.500" style="s2">militant establishment of the civil</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.770" end="01:48:42.989" style="s2">rights movement and basically the whole</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.500" end="01:48:44.970" style="s2">spectrum of the humanizing perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.989" end="01:48:47.370" style="s2">in a way that that shifted the</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.970" end="01:48:49.020" style="s2">conversation in America but bore fruit</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.370" end="01:48:51.330" style="s2">in the actual cultural lives of</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.020" end="01:48:55.110" style="s2">Americans left right and center black</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.330" end="01:48:57.120" style="s2">right etc to me that is that is the key</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.110" end="01:48:58.470" style="s2">question that is the key project and</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.120" end="01:49:05.070" style="s2">that&#39;s what I hope folks on this call</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.470" end="01:49:08.190" style="s2">would focus on great is next I just said</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.070" end="01:49:10.350" style="s2">I think that in America we live</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.190" end="01:49:13.080" style="s2">extraordinarily segregated lives still</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.350" end="01:49:14.700" style="s2">and the only way that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.080" end="01:49:16.950" style="s2">problems are going to be solved is how</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.700" end="01:49:19.260" style="s2">is if we figure out how people can meet</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.950" end="01:49:21.180" style="s2">each other on more equal terms so I come</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.260" end="01:49:22.650" style="s2">back to I think I&#39;m agreeing with what I</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.180" end="01:49:25.130" style="s2">think you were getting at right is that</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.650" end="01:49:27.420" style="s2">there has to be some form of material</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.130" end="01:49:30.510" style="s2">equalization going on before we&#39;ll ever</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.420" end="01:49:40.440" style="s2">figure out to the vision that still</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.510" end="01:49:44.370" style="s2">plagues us great Coleman I can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.440" end="01:49:46.380" style="s2">but feel like there are various ways of</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.370" end="01:49:48.500" style="s2">trying to say that this problem is</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.380" end="01:49:51.300" style="s2">actually another problem in disguise</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.500" end="01:49:54.000" style="s2">whether that&#39;s political corruption or</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.300" end="01:49:59.390" style="s2">lack of Economic Opportunity or economic</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.000" end="01:50:01.600" style="s2">inequality and I I&#39;m left feeling</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.390" end="01:50:04.470" style="s2">unconvinced by those I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.600" end="01:50:09.370" style="s2">feeling that this problem is hopelessly</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.470" end="01:50:13.630" style="s2">self-generated and will outlive and</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.370" end="01:50:16.840" style="s2">persist in in spite of our being able to</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.630" end="01:50:19.120" style="s2">potentially solve or make progress on</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.840" end="01:50:20.950" style="s2">all of those other issues I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.120" end="01:50:23.710" style="s2">problem of perception it&#39;s a problem of</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.950" end="01:50:29.130" style="s2">beliefs that are often that often have</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.710" end="01:50:32.290" style="s2">no other cause outside of the inherent</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.130" end="01:50:34.810" style="s2">appeal of the beliefs themselves beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.290" end="01:50:36.490" style="s2">about what what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.810" end="01:50:38.110" style="s2">one-race rather than another beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.490" end="01:50:40.300" style="s2">about what you inherit by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.110" end="01:50:45.460" style="s2">being one race beliefs about how much</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.300" end="01:50:48.970" style="s2">racism there is in society so I yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.460" end="01:50:51.370" style="s2">I&#39;m I am I I think it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.970" end="01:50:53.170" style="s2">to consider the possibility that there</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.370" end="01:50:55.120" style="s2">actually caused by something else that</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.170" end="01:50:57.640" style="s2">we can focus on some root cause of these</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.120" end="01:51:01.660" style="s2">issues but I&#39;m I&#39;m left feeling that</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.640" end="01:51:03.910" style="s2">they&#39;re hopelessly self generated before</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.660" end="01:51:06.400" style="s2">I asked someone else to step in let me</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.910" end="01:51:10.510" style="s2">just say root causes one way to look at</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.400" end="01:51:14.050" style="s2">it but basically failure mode is another</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.510" end="01:51:15.610" style="s2">that a lack of leadership and political</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.050" end="01:51:17.830" style="s2">corruption are two sides of the same</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.610" end="01:51:19.480" style="s2">coin and that in effect until you have</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.830" end="01:51:22.630" style="s2">solved that problem you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.480" end="01:51:24.700" style="s2">navigating blind right little works some</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.630" end="01:51:26.410" style="s2">some interests that are above the public</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.700" end="01:51:29.350" style="s2">interest are steering and it results in</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.410" end="01:51:30.820" style="s2">failure after failure and so I hear your</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.350" end="01:51:32.710" style="s2">hopelessness but what I want to convince</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.820" end="01:51:34.270" style="s2">you of is you know to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.710" end="01:51:36.370" style="s2">somebody has hooked up the controls in</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.270" end="01:51:38.680" style="s2">the control room backwards solving that</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.370" end="01:51:40.450" style="s2">one thing actually immediately has</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.680" end="01:51:44.740" style="s2">downstream consequences that are very</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.450" end="01:51:46.830" style="s2">positive I want to identify with : and I</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.740" end="01:51:49.630" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure I agree with you Brett</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.830" end="01:51:55.540" style="s2">and and here&#39;s why I&#39;ll be very concise</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.630" end="01:51:58.600" style="s2">shut down stem ok so the problem here is</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.540" end="01:52:00.310" style="s2">an intellectual identity problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.600" end="01:52:02.290" style="s2">not a resource problem it&#39;s not people</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.310" end="01:52:04.510" style="s2">being poor who are the people who is</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.290" end="01:52:07.710" style="s2">saying shut down stem there graduate</p>

<p begin="01:53:07.699" end="01:53:13.010" style="s2">counterintuitive from the outside and</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.390" end="01:53:15.199" style="s2">yeah we have to think of for example the</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.010" end="01:53:16.880" style="s2">affluent black kid at Stanford who same</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.199" end="01:53:18.830" style="s2">shutdown&#39;s them they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.880" end="01:53:21.440" style="s2">not hungry they haven&#39;t been denied</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.830" end="01:53:23.810" style="s2">anything it&#39;s an ideology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.440" end="01:53:26.659" style="s2">peculiar self-serving comfortable and</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.810" end="01:53:28.760" style="s2">destructive ideologies that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.659" end="01:53:31.610" style="s2">think a group of human beings would</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.760" end="01:53:33.590" style="s2">embrace unless you think about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.610" end="01:53:35.719" style="s2">that it can only often emerge when</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.590" end="01:53:38.570" style="s2">resources are distributed relatively</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.719" end="01:53:41.469" style="s2">effectively that&#39;s the challenge that we</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.570" end="01:53:44.330" style="s2">have these are very very modern people</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.469" end="01:53:46.550" style="s2">they they are but I would just point out</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.330" end="01:53:50.840" style="s2">shut down stem which was particularly</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.550" end="01:53:53.659" style="s2">galling and frightening is not organic</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.840" end="01:53:55.610" style="s2">it is a demonstration of power getting</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.659" end="01:53:57.350" style="s2">people to say shut down stem getting</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.610" end="01:53:59.179" style="s2">scientific establishments to say shut</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.350" end="01:54:01.580" style="s2">down stem was a demonstration of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.179" end="01:54:03.230" style="s2">amazing power of this movement and you</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.580" end="01:54:05.030" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily assume that the people</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.230" end="01:54:07.219" style="s2">who are saying it are saying it because</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.030" end="01:54:08.710" style="s2">they believe stem doesn&#39;t work they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.219" end="01:54:10.880" style="s2">saying it because they&#39;re serving</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.710" end="01:54:12.830" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get out of the way of</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.880" end="01:54:14.330" style="s2">a mob or they&#39;re trying to their</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.830" end="01:54:17.179" style="s2">wrongheaded and they&#39;re trying to serve</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.330" end="01:54:19.730" style="s2">that movement and so they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.179" end="01:54:22.340" style="s2">things that make no sense but I guess</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.730" end="01:54:25.100" style="s2">what I would wrap up with is I would</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.340" end="01:54:26.630" style="s2">just say look I have moments of</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.100" end="01:54:29.270" style="s2">hopelessness too</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.630" end="01:54:32.719" style="s2">and I do see a problem that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.270" end="01:54:34.550" style="s2">be very difficult to solve however the</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.719" end="01:54:38.389" style="s2">ability to think clearly without</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.550" end="01:54:40.699" style="s2">conflicts of interest is a prerequisite</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.389" end="01:54:43.159" style="s2">to solving it it&#39;s not sufficient but it</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.699" end="01:54:45.889" style="s2">is necessary and so I would urge you all</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.159" end="01:54:48.920" style="s2">to consider what do we lose if we solve</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.889" end="01:54:50.420" style="s2">the corruption problem and it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.920" end="01:54:51.679" style="s2">not to be sufficient we have lost</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.420" end="01:54:53.659" style="s2">nothing because we&#39;re headed for a</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.679" end="01:54:55.219" style="s2">disaster anyway if we solve the</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.659" end="01:54:56.719" style="s2">corruption problem and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.219" end="01:54:59.389" style="s2">it is causing us to be unable to think</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.719" end="01:55:01.070" style="s2">about what good solutions might be what</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.389" end="01:55:04.159" style="s2">they would look like unable to innovate</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.070" end="01:55:06.620" style="s2">as Camille said then we potentially have</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.159" end="01:55:09.500" style="s2">a bright future ahead of us so I would</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.620" end="01:55:12.830" style="s2">just say I hear your doubts I share them</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.500" end="01:55:15.320" style="s2">but holy hell we&#39;re headed for very very</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.830" end="01:55:16.790" style="s2">dangerous waters and we might as well do</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.320" end="01:55:18.800" style="s2">the one thing that makes obvious sense</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.790" end="01:55:22.790" style="s2">which is restore our ability to think</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.800" end="01:55:24.469" style="s2">without conflicts of interest yeah we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.790" end="01:55:26.989" style="s2">say maybe perhaps building a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.469" end="01:55:30.699" style="s2">bridge that I I do find your</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.989" end="01:55:33.590" style="s2">observations about leadership and the</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.699" end="01:55:35.659" style="s2">interesting development with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.590" end="01:55:38.690" style="s2">the role that these leaderless political</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.659" end="01:55:40.699" style="s2">movements are playing in society that</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.690" end="01:55:42.260" style="s2">combined with the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.699" end="01:55:45.020" style="s2">communicating with one another now it</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.260" end="01:55:47.719" style="s2">does strike me as something that is more</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.020" end="01:55:49.520" style="s2">than just a little novel it&#39;s this is a</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.719" end="01:55:54.639" style="s2">pretty substantial development and it</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.520" end="01:55:57.020" style="s2">may very well be that a lack of having a</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.639" end="01:55:58.670" style="s2">significant personality in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.020" end="01:56:01.730" style="s2">intellectual landscape that can actually</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.670" end="01:56:05.030" style="s2">help to direct some of these energies is</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.730" end="01:56:06.830" style="s2">a real deficiency perhaps even a danger</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.030" end="01:56:09.860" style="s2">that we might want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.830" end="01:56:12.320" style="s2">deliberately rectify so right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.860" end="01:56:14.750" style="s2">very interesting all right so I would</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.320" end="01:56:17.179" style="s2">just point out we all know we all know</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.750" end="01:56:19.370" style="s2">that neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.179" end="01:56:21.650" style="s2">has the answer here and I think we all</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.370" end="01:56:23.870" style="s2">know that we don&#39;t necessarily have four</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.650" end="01:56:26.449" style="s2">years to wait for a solution that makes</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.870" end="01:56:29.510" style="s2">sense so I would ask you all to consider</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.449" end="01:56:32.330" style="s2">something like the Unity 2020 proposal</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.510" end="01:56:34.469" style="s2">for rising above politics and fixing</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.330" end="01:56:37.770" style="s2">this problem directly</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.469" end="01:56:40.620" style="s2">okay take a look at it appreciate that</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.770" end="01:56:43.170" style="s2">really do and I appreciate all of you I</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.620" end="01:56:45.030" style="s2">appreciate your courage your generosity</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.170" end="01:56:47.310" style="s2">of spirit your willingness to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.030" end="01:56:48.180" style="s2">a very dangerous exercise and your</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.310" end="01:56:50.880" style="s2">patriotism</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.180" end="01:56:54.330" style="s2">so thanks folks I hope we can do this</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.880" end="01:56:58.170" style="s2">again soon Thank You Brett thank you so</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.330" end="01:57:12.010" style="s2">much bread all right be well so long</p>
