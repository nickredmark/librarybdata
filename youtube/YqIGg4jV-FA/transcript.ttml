<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.700" style="s2">a few weeks ago I published an article</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">on my blog that really stimulated a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:10.530" style="s2">of debate that article is called the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:13.469" style="s2">real reason conservatives always win and</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">in it I took the argument put forth in</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.469" end="00:00:18.690" style="s2">this book the social conquest of Earth</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:20.789" style="s2">by Edward Wilson it took his basic</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.690" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">argument which is that groups that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.789" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">greater cohesion tend to win over groups</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">that have less cohesion and I applied</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">that argument to us politics making the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">claim that conservatives in the United</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">States have much deeper or social</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">cohesion and have invested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">infrastructure that allows them to work</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">in a coordinated fashion where as</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">progressives tend to be divided into</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">issue silos and don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">investments in infrastructure especially</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">media and organizing skills capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">and so progressives tend to lose and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">want to explore that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:00.230" style="s2">further today as we look to the future</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">and think about the upcoming</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.230" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">presidential election in the United</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">States as well as more broadly the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">challenges that we face in addressing</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">global problems such as climate change</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">and resource depletion where this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">question of group cohesion is really</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">fundamental and asking ourselves will</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">humanity be able to come together on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">global scale and deal with our problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">and so the basic argument that Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">laid out in this book is that the social</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">organization of animals that have social</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">behavior such as ants and termites bees</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">and of course humans enables those</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">species that are able to form stronger</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:47.579" style="s2">social organization to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">out-compete those individual species</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">that cannot form such strong group</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">cohesion and there&#39;s plenty of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">for why this might be the case but in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">the context of us politics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">more broadly in the global approach to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">dealing with things like climate we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">to ask this question of what does it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:10.710" style="s2">take to create group cohesion how does</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">group cohesion work</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.710" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">and how can we learn from what we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">getting a sense of from science about</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">group cohesion to be able to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">these problems and Wilson does a nice</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">job of laying out why it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">for us to be asking this question but he</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give the complete answer on his</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:32.970" style="s2">own and so I picked up another book this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">one here moral origins the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.970" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">virtue altruism and shame by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">anthropologist Christopher bone and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">started reading it because Bowman asks a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">very fundamental question he asks how is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">it that social morality arises in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:53.370" style="s2">particular kinds of groups that are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:55.350" style="s2">human ancestry specifically the long</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:58.320" style="s2">period of time where we lived in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.350" end="00:03:01.850" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies and his</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.320" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">argument is that the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.850" end="00:03:08.130" style="s2">selection pressure for groups over</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">individuals arose in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.130" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">hunting for big game and the need for</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">small groups of people in their tribes</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:19.710" style="s2">to be able to punish bullies or</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:23.130" style="s2">dictators people who would cheat in game</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.710" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">the the hunting system to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.130" end="00:03:26.460" style="s2">advantage for themselves to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:30.210" style="s2">detriment of the group and so his</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.460" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">suggestion was that the the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.210" end="00:03:35.910" style="s2">social behavior of altruism can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">linked with the punishment or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.910" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">punitive aspects of shame and that those</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:43.710" style="s2">who would try to take more for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">themselves would be shamed by their</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.710" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">group and of course everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:49.830" style="s2">group knew each other so the shaming</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.190" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">could be very effective and an ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:55.770" style="s2">form of shaming would be to ostracize or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">kick that cheater out of the group which</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.770" end="00:04:01.110" style="s2">would lead to almost certain death in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">those times because survival outside of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.110" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">the group was so precarious so as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">think about last year with the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:10.020" style="s2">the Occupy movement and we asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:11.610" style="s2">ourselves how is it that global</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.020" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">civilization is dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.610" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">cheaters or those who game the global</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">economy for individual gained over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">collective well-being that same</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">fundamental question that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:23.690" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:26.270" style="s2">grabbed</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.690" end="00:04:28.700" style="s2">with all the way back to antiquity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.270" end="00:04:30.770" style="s2">the rise of social organization and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.700" end="00:04:33.020" style="s2">species that&#39;s been a fundamental thread</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">and so Christopher bomb has been trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.020" end="00:04:37.820" style="s2">to answer that question one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">things that he suggests is that the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.820" end="00:04:44.390" style="s2">that we understand how social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.180" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">is reinforced is to first look at how</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.390" end="00:04:49.670" style="s2">antisocial behavior is punished and now</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:51.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not the end of the story but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.670" end="00:04:53.000" style="s2">a very important beginning piece and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.710" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">think we should hold on to that as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.000" end="00:04:58.820" style="s2">ask this question of how do we develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:00.950" style="s2">frameworks for cooperation especially at</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.820" end="00:05:03.410" style="s2">a scale larger than individual cultures</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.950" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">such as the global scale to do with big</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.410" end="00:05:09.410" style="s2">problems and that questions like what</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:11.740" style="s2">Christopher bounzer as grap as grappling</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.410" end="00:05:16.100" style="s2">with are going to be very very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.740" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">now we actually have some research</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.100" end="00:05:20.540" style="s2">historic research in modern times take</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:22.550" style="s2">this out of that hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.540" end="00:05:25.460" style="s2">contacts and helps us begin to answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.550" end="00:05:28.460" style="s2">this question of how does cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.460" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">work in the complexities of modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.460" end="00:05:34.419" style="s2">society and this book here my Robert</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.419" end="00:05:40.100" style="s2">actually a really helpful helpful kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.220" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">of a teachable moment for thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.100" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">how cooperation can lead us astray is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">what Paxton asked himself was he</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:53.419" style="s2">basically asked how is it that a group</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.600" end="00:05:57.290" style="s2">of people can use a democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.419" end="00:05:58.669" style="s2">to establish a dictatorship which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.290" end="00:06:00.590" style="s2">somewhat the opposite of what Krista</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.669" end="00:06:03.500" style="s2">Boehm was saying about hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.590" end="00:06:06.050" style="s2">societies where the egalitarian ethos</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:07.460" style="s2">and the social morality of sharing</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.050" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">that&#39;s so essential for tribal</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.460" end="00:06:12.919" style="s2">communities to survive could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:16.669" style="s2">subverted through a tribal identity that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.919" end="00:06:18.620" style="s2">enables a group of elites to evoke that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.669" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">tribal identity and then place a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.620" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">dictator at the helm of the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">which is what happened with mussolini</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:30.980" style="s2">and italy post-world War one it&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.819" end="00:07:18.530" style="s2">begin to answer that is to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">we know about fascism and of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:24.860" style="s2">fascism is an unusual mix of shared</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.409" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">the question that I see the way needy</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.659" end="00:07:52.819" style="s2">answer is how do we take these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">questions you know the nature of group</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.819" end="00:07:58.610" style="s2">cohesion how it allows one group to help</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.610" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">cohesion can enable bullies to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.370" end="00:08:06.919" style="s2">and set up dictatorships when we ask the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:08.779" style="s2">questions how does all that work one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.919" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">the fundamental questions that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.779" end="00:08:16.819" style="s2">mind is how does a group of people evoke</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.819" end="00:08:20.360" style="s2">thinking about the world that becomes</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.349" end="00:08:33.020" style="s2">that leads to subjugation of the group</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:35.570" style="s2">and what we found historically is it the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.020" end="00:08:37.969" style="s2">only way that human beings could form</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.570" end="00:08:40.459" style="s2">greater strength than individuals was to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.969" end="00:08:42.229" style="s2">form organizations and until recently</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.459" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">the only way that we could form</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.229" end="00:08:47.630" style="s2">organizations was through a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">centralized top-down command and control</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.630" end="00:08:50.840" style="s2">you could almost think of it as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">industrial model</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.840" end="00:08:57.830" style="s2">of manufacturing applied to division of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:08:59.720" style="s2">labor so you would have an executive who</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.830" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">would lead an organization that would</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.720" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">then sudden agenda and would create a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">kind of subjugation for the workers and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:10.130" style="s2">this is what we call um you know today</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:12.710" style="s2">we think about people who work a job to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.130" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">get a wage because they can&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.710" end="00:09:16.700" style="s2">and provide for their own without having</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:19.820" style="s2">a job that pays for their salary that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.700" end="00:09:22.100" style="s2">a kind of on coercion where they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.820" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">coerced by a need for money to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.100" end="00:09:26.090" style="s2">within a system that subjugates them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:28.310" style="s2">that system and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.090" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">centralized management structure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.310" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">enables the owner of that organization</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">which may be the investors in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:38.660" style="s2">corporation and that they are then able</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:40.790" style="s2">to have undue influence and power over</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.660" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">the workers and create a system with</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.790" end="00:09:45.790" style="s2">strong social cohesion that actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:48.260" style="s2">creates a kind of centralized control</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.790" end="00:09:50.030" style="s2">now recently there have been a number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.260" end="00:09:52.400" style="s2">breakthroughs in the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.030" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">organize society in the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.400" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">organize people to get things done then</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">has broken out of this mold and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:02.770" style="s2">been driven by the digital</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:06.020" style="s2">communications and software computing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.770" end="00:10:10.400" style="s2">technology revolutions of the last 40 to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.020" end="00:10:13.400" style="s2">50 years and so we see that if we look</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.400" end="00:10:15.830" style="s2">at phenomena like the open-source</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.400" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">software movement and this book here the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.830" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">success of open-source by Steven Weber</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:25.130" style="s2">lays out in very clear detail how it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">that the economics and the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.130" end="00:10:30.230" style="s2">group collaboration can happen without</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2">there being any centralized command and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.230" end="00:10:35.510" style="s2">control system and so the basic question</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:37.270" style="s2">is how can a group of people with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.510" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">shared affinity and a shared agenda</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.270" end="00:10:41.810" style="s2">organize themselves without a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:43.820" style="s2">centralized Authority and that has now</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.810" end="00:10:45.470" style="s2">been demonstrated through projects like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.820" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">the formation of the Linux operating</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.470" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">system the creation of Wikipedia as an</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">sharing knowledge and those basic</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.450" end="00:10:58.040" style="s2">questions are being answered one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:10:59.780" style="s2">critical ones is what is the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.040" end="00:11:02.330" style="s2">economic transaction for like minded</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.780" end="00:11:03.420" style="s2">people to find each other and distribute</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">organizing tools enable people to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.000" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">aggregate themselves at a very low cost</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:21.960" style="s2">of time and effort to be able to work on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.460" style="s2">very large projects without their</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.460" end="00:11:29.720" style="s2">which means for the first time ever we</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.190" end="00:11:32.430" style="s2">can replace a kind of fascist top-down</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:39.150" style="s2">much more open collaborative transparent</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:43.080" style="s2">been plenty of writing about how this</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:45.030" style="s2">works I&#39;ll give two examples one is from</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.080" end="00:11:47.310" style="s2">Clay Shirky he&#39;s written several books</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.030" end="00:11:49.590" style="s2">but this one really lays out the core</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.310" end="00:11:51.990" style="s2">ideas here comes everybody and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.590" end="00:11:55.110" style="s2">subtitle is revolution doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.990" end="00:11:57.000" style="s2">when society adopts new technology it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.110" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">happens when society adopts new</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.000" end="00:12:02.040" style="s2">behaviors and so this book is about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:05.630" style="s2">poor power of organizing without</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.040" end="00:12:07.860" style="s2">organizations and Clay Shirky explains</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:09.990" style="s2">include clear detail that supports</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">Steven Weber&#39;s work that we now have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.990" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">technology and the cultural knowledge of</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.880" style="s2">we&#39;re actually tackling this problem of</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.940" end="00:13:11.250" style="s2">leading to a lot of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.410" end="00:13:13.310" style="s2">such as as this book describes the rise</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.460" end="00:13:34.209" style="s2">three centuries is that the typical way</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.209" end="00:13:39.730" style="s2">is that those who can control and</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.360" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">so if we fail to invest in shared</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.150" end="00:17:44.419" style="s2">infrastructure then we lose the ability</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:21.259" style="s2">all builds up to I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.809" end="00:18:24.499" style="s2">important question which is how does the</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.279" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">cooperative drives because they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:35.989" style="s2">part of human nature and that leads to a</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">Jeremy Rifkin what Rifkin shows is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.690" end="00:23:23.669" style="s2">there is a general trend that as any</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">society becomes more complex it has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.669" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">greater division of labor which means</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:30.179" style="s2">there are more clarified roles for how</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.179" end="00:23:35.309" style="s2">society and that the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.429" end="00:23:38.160" style="s2">understand those different roles is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.309" end="00:23:40.169" style="s2">expression of an increase in empathy the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.160" end="00:23:42.690" style="s2">ability to see from different</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.169" end="00:23:50.669" style="s2">and that as we look across time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.690" end="00:23:53.130" style="s2">a historic trend that as any</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.540" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">out there and so we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.540" end="00:26:25.730" style="s2">parliamentary multi-party systems that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.700" end="00:26:28.790" style="s2">enable each group in society to be able</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:10.289" style="s2">course in the United States we can see</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.190" end="00:27:13.409" style="s2">that we have a two-party system that</p>
