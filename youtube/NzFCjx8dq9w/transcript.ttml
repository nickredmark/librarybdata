<p begin="00:01:19.130" end="00:01:24.050" style="s2">life players with everyone today</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.870" end="00:01:26.510" style="s2">this is a start of something of a series</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.050" end="00:01:28.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.510" end="00:01:30.980" style="s2">concept right</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.130" end="00:01:33.170" style="s2">live players are people who in fact are</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.980" end="00:01:35.030" style="s2">still shaping our world so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.170" end="00:01:37.810" style="s2">always something to talk about in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.030" end="00:01:41.409" style="s2">regard and there mini-sub ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.810" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">adaptive individuals shape the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.409" end="00:01:46.400" style="s2">let&#39;s first think of some people who you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:50.210" style="s2">know might be good examples of live</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.400" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">players one of my favorite examples are</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.210" end="00:01:56.120" style="s2">is Elon Musk he was recently in the news</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.060" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">this Wednesday he&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.120" end="00:02:02.030" style="s2">someone who took two completely failing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:04.220" style="s2">industries in a way aerospace and car</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.030" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">manufacturing and actually pushed him</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.220" end="00:02:09.860" style="s2">forward into something relatively new or</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:11.959" style="s2">even completely new this was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.860" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">basically something that wasn&#39;t supposed</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.959" end="00:02:17.390" style="s2">to happen and wasn&#39;t going to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">in fact almost every bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:22.430" style="s2">institution stood in his way right</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:25.639" style="s2">including his nominal clients it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.430" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">NASA let alone his competitors at Boeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.639" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2">and later on possibly compared</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">who are as live as he is such as Bezos</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.060" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">most people in the world operate off of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">scripts they operate off of what has</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:45.160" style="s2">worked before what they&#39;ve observed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">been socialized works for other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.160" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">because of that it&#39;s best to model human</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:53.180" style="s2">behavior as exploring these different</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:56.090" style="s2">ecological niches right so a bird</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.180" end="00:02:58.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to fly it knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.090" end="00:03:00.530" style="s2">fly but it doesn&#39;t know how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">aerodynamics works and a bird certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.530" end="00:03:05.299" style="s2">couldn&#39;t design another bird and a bird</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">certainly can&#39;t really learn how to swim</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.299" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">it might through many you know dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">generations hundreds of generations</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:14.299" style="s2">millions of generations evolved into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:16.340" style="s2">duck or a penguin or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.299" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s never going to do this valley</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:21.290" style="s2">crossing on its own in a single lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:25.099" style="s2">this is precisely what life players do</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.290" end="00:03:29.150" style="s2">when I analyze you know basically these</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.099" end="00:03:31.099" style="s2">exceptional individuals we always look</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.150" end="00:03:33.260" style="s2">for the signs of someone mastering more</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.099" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">than one domain especially if this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.260" end="00:03:38.810" style="s2">domain is completely disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:42.079" style="s2">previous domains right something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.810" end="00:03:43.730" style="s2">we&#39;re someone that historically might</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.079" end="00:03:45.590" style="s2">have shown you know small a strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.730" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">predisposition towards intelligence work</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:50.980" style="s2">ends up also being a good general or</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">someone that had previously run</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.980" end="00:03:55.700" style="s2">entrepreneurial ventures suddenly turns</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:58.370" style="s2">out to be an exceptional artist in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.700" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">own right or someone that was once an</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.370" end="00:04:02.870" style="s2">exceptional artist ends up being a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:05.239" style="s2">politician an interesting example here</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.870" end="00:04:07.160" style="s2">is Arnold Schwarzenegger who might seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.239" end="00:04:08.989" style="s2">like a very trivial example but consider</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.160" end="00:04:12.290" style="s2">how many people would in the course of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.989" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">their life be and you know missing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.290" end="00:04:16.609" style="s2">missing soldier who doesn&#39;t show up to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:18.769" style="s2">the right appointment because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.609" end="00:04:20.389" style="s2">doing a bodybuilder competition and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.769" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">manages to talk themselves out of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.389" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">disciplinary inquiry by arguing that him</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.190" style="s2">winning the bodybuilding competition is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:29.690" style="s2">good PR for his military unit he did</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.190" end="00:04:32.690" style="s2">that in Austria that&#39;s how he got his</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.690" end="00:04:35.419" style="s2">start and after that would pivot this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.690" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">into appearing in a documentary but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.419" end="00:04:38.990" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t stop there would be an actor</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">now of course once he became an actor</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.990" end="00:04:42.360" style="s2">people constantly kept saying he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:44.490" style="s2">really an actor</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.360" end="00:04:47.639" style="s2">is just a mountain of muscle he just</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.490" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">appears on screen now when he ran for</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.639" end="00:04:52.379" style="s2">when he ran to be governor of California</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:54.030" style="s2">that&#39;s when they started calling him an</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.379" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">actor right didn&#39;t dismiss him as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.030" end="00:04:57.509" style="s2">politician you can really dismiss him as</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:05:00.930" style="s2">a bodybuilder he&#39;d have to dismiss him</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.509" end="00:05:02.909" style="s2">as an actor in each of these cases there</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.930" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">was like some transfer of skill</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.909" end="00:05:08.069" style="s2">obviously right like physical and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.930" style="s2">and there was always this thread of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.069" end="00:05:12.090" style="s2">charisma and persuasiveness that he had</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.930" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">but very importantly he was able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.090" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">reinvent himself over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">again and I&#39;m quite sure where the</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.850" end="00:13:27.319" style="s2">as well the interesting thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.220" end="00:13:30.250" style="s2">is the social engineering is even</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.319" end="00:13:33.319" style="s2">evident and the way he approached</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.319" end="00:13:38.960" style="s2">could use a boring test Wade satellite</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.960" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">wanted to test the Falcon heavy rocket</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.970" end="00:13:47.900" style="s2">he used a sports car you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:50.270" style="s2">sports car was a dummy dressed in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.900" end="00:13:52.460" style="s2">astronaut suit that astronauts who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.270" end="00:13:54.410" style="s2">looked very much like a Formula One</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.410" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">racecar drivers had he had that spunk</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.140" end="00:14:00.500" style="s2">planned out for years it was probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:01.700" style="s2">one of the key considerations he had</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:03.950" style="s2">when the space suit was being designed</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.700" end="00:14:05.480" style="s2">and in fact it looks almost identical to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.950" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">the space suit the astronauts are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.480" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">be flying in this Saturday how different</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:12.080" style="s2">is this from NASA style these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.420" style="s2">like NASA&#39;s astronauts these are alongs</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.080" end="00:14:16.670" style="s2">astronauts right they&#39;re gonna drive</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.420" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">there in the Tesla they&#39;re gonna go up</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.670" end="00:14:21.560" style="s2">there on the rocket they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:23.480" style="s2">gonna even have a shot where they repeat</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.560" end="00:14:25.460" style="s2">some of the same dumb jokes as they had</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.480" end="00:14:27.470" style="s2">from the car right like the music that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.460" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">was playing in the car or the towel that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.470" end="00:14:31.700" style="s2">was a reference to the Hitchhiker&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.670" end="00:14:47.090" style="s2">so obviously cater to the engineers</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.090" end="00:14:50.360" style="s2">inside of SpaceX means that within</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.090" end="00:14:52.550" style="s2">SpaceX the engineers rather than the PR</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.360" end="00:14:54.740" style="s2">people are listened to because the PR</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.550" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">people see that the engineers tastes are</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:15:02.750" style="s2">the ones that matter right and basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:06.230" style="s2">he has single-handedly made NASA cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.750" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">again NASA might not really like him why</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.230" end="00:15:11.510" style="s2">because he&#39;s basically bypassing massive</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:13.370" style="s2">amounts of jobs programs for them but</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.510" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">their entire budget is based on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.370" end="00:15:18.440" style="s2">kind of coolness in popularity right</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:22.010" style="s2">he&#39;s the one that&#39;s replacing 1999 NASA</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.080" end="00:15:43.070" style="s2">bypassed this means that he still</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.510" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">probably occasionally has to smack down</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:46.970" style="s2">a nerd because engineers have a problem</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.509" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">Google has for example messed us up I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.609" end="00:16:06.749" style="s2">think in Google very slightly rebranded</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.360" end="00:20:53.550" style="s2">until it isn&#39;t one way to think of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:57.000" style="s2">is that you know the British colonial</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.550" end="00:20:58.770" style="s2">office was largest in the 1960 is one</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.000" end="00:21:00.510" style="s2">year before its abolition because it was</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.510" end="00:21:04.110" style="s2">had the most employees but largest</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2">different one might have been the</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">had very thin margins these massive</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.580" end="00:21:49.740" style="s2">think most politicians most CEOs right</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.750" style="s2">now are dead players I really hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.740" end="00:21:53.400" style="s2">to name people who I think are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.750" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">dead players because this could be seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.400" end="00:21:58.620" style="s2">as an attack rather there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:11.880" style="s2">like to ask your question hi Simone my</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.350" end="00:22:16.710" style="s2">question is to you Rachel</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.880" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">all right yeah I love the beauty on my</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.710" end="00:22:25.620" style="s2">question is about engineers that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.460" end="00:22:27.300" style="s2">really great founders but they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.620" end="00:22:29.880" style="s2">these visions for products that you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.300" end="00:22:31.920" style="s2">know you can&#39;t launch is there</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.880" end="00:22:34.020" style="s2">specific way that you would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.920" end="00:22:36.900" style="s2">for fine-tuning them if they&#39;re talented</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.020" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">enough to have the ground vision if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.900" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">continue to like want to produce things</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:45.030" style="s2">that aren&#39;t economically viable how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:46.560" style="s2">you strategize that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.030" end="00:22:48.390" style="s2">difficult question I think it depends to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.560" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">a significant amount on the engineer I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.390" end="00:22:54.870" style="s2">think if you get a good sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:57.930" style="s2">engineer for what they find as a fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.870" end="00:23:00.570" style="s2">problem and you kind of find the product</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.930" end="00:23:02.580" style="s2">and then and then you talk to them about</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.570" end="00:23:04.500" style="s2">a fun problem they could solve that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.580" end="00:23:06.360" style="s2">happens to be technically very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.500" end="00:23:08.250" style="s2">and necessary for your product I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.360" end="00:23:10.560" style="s2">that works super well so you might</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.250" end="00:23:12.390" style="s2">actually need a team of a super talented</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.560" end="00:23:14.730" style="s2">engineer that solves a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.390" end="00:23:17.370" style="s2">difficult problem and a less talented</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.730" end="00:23:21.930" style="s2">engineer you just kind of direct them</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.370" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">the right way another way is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.930" end="00:23:26.790" style="s2">educate the engineer about people this</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:29.100" style="s2">is more difficult but I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.790" end="00:23:31.020" style="s2">this is you know people know about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.100" end="00:23:32.910" style="s2">negative part of the relationship Steve</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.020" end="00:23:33.930" style="s2">Jobs had what his technical partner but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.910" end="00:23:36.090" style="s2">what they don&#39;t know is that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.930" end="00:23:38.220" style="s2">positive end of it was he would find all</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.090" end="00:23:41.390" style="s2">these ingenious way to in ways to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">communicate things about people right</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.390" end="00:23:48.030" style="s2">there&#39;s this like very classic story</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:50.160" style="s2">well you know can you shave off time off</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.030" end="00:23:52.440" style="s2">of you know how long it takes for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.160" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">machine to boot up and the person says</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.440" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">you know no I can&#39;t do that and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:57.260" style="s2">like well if someone&#39;s life depended on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:23:59.730" style="s2">it could you do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.260" end="00:24:02.010" style="s2">and he says obviously yes I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.730" end="00:24:03.750" style="s2">to do something and then he comes back</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.010" end="00:24:06.780" style="s2">with a calculation of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.750" end="00:24:08.280" style="s2">users second save and it turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.780" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">be something like five to ten human</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.280" end="00:24:13.740" style="s2">lifetimes like pool games or cards they</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.960" style="s2">can solve to get them to do specific</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.740" end="00:24:17.850" style="s2">time next oh because I think a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.960" end="00:24:19.650" style="s2">bit disconnected disembodied right they</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.850" end="00:24:21.270" style="s2">care about people they just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.650" end="00:24:28.130" style="s2">evilly to think about people first they</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.270" end="00:24:30.370" style="s2">think about new systems first cool</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.130" end="00:24:32.260" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.370" end="00:24:36.809" style="s2">Jacob I don&#39;t is this a question that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.260" end="00:24:36.809" style="s2">you want to bring forth or just a idea I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.559" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know it was a pretty good question</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.350" end="00:24:45.880" style="s2">but this will move on Jake if you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:48.580" style="s2">to ask it later I&#39;ll just call on you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.880" end="00:24:51.580" style="s2">later just let me know Alan do you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.580" end="00:24:54.520" style="s2">to ask your question yeah sure so really</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.580" end="00:24:57.130" style="s2">interesting topic kind of been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.520" end="00:24:59.140" style="s2">about it a lot recently my question is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.130" end="00:25:01.570" style="s2">you know you mentioned live players that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.140" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">are currently within the existing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.570" end="00:25:06.520" style="s2">political establishment or structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.860" style="s2">whether that&#39;s on a national scale or</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.520" end="00:25:11.380" style="s2">international scale there&#39;s also these</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.860" end="00:25:13.300" style="s2">live players that are kind of outside of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.380" end="00:25:16.270" style="s2">it you know whether they&#39;re Jeff Bezos</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.300" end="00:25:19.030" style="s2">or Elon Musk these founders that have</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.270" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">kind of these really wild ambitions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.030" end="00:25:26.590" style="s2">aspirations and it seems like in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:28.900" style="s2">past years there&#39;s been kind of a meme</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.590" end="00:25:31.000" style="s2">of you know Jeff Bezos taking over and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.900" end="00:25:33.280" style="s2">kind of he everyone&#39;s gonna be living</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.000" end="00:25:35.110" style="s2">under either Amazon or Apple you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.280" end="00:25:37.480" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be your citizenship rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.110" end="00:25:40.510" style="s2">than the United States or Russia how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.480" end="00:25:42.760" style="s2">you see the next I don&#39;t know 5 10 15</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.510" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">years playing out with the live players</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.760" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">that are within the existing political</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:49.510" style="s2">structure and those outside of it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:52.800" style="s2">and the threat that it that it poses for</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.510" end="00:25:56.580" style="s2">those within it well I think our</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.800" end="00:25:59.230" style="s2">political structure right now is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.580" end="00:26:01.300" style="s2">significantly bereft of life players</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.230" end="00:26:04.120" style="s2">right I think we have a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.300" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">that were very used to things behaving</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.120" end="00:26:08.500" style="s2">in this super predictable super</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:10.330" style="s2">bureaucratic way and they find it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.500" end="00:26:12.490" style="s2">upsetting when the bureaucracies either</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.330" end="00:26:15.340" style="s2">stop working or don&#39;t connect to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.490" end="00:26:17.590" style="s2">world I think it&#39;s super telling no</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.340" end="00:26:21.280" style="s2">matter who was the president that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.590" end="00:26:25.420" style="s2">CDC and the FDA could not in fact adapt</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.280" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">in an agile way to code right and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.420" end="00:26:29.050" style="s2">think that we can you in fact have</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.820" end="00:33:13.470" style="s2">Stalinism or something you can translate</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.980" end="00:33:16.260" style="s2">parts of it and also go to her main site</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.470" end="00:33:19.370" style="s2">it has amazing energy it has big</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.260" end="00:33:19.370" style="s2">programmer energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:29.490" style="s2">so there we are cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.760" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a weirdness partially because our</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.490" end="00:33:33.330" style="s2">sense of normalcy is constructed</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:37.140" style="s2">partially because the people are misfits</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.330" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">they they were round and they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.140" end="00:33:40.650" style="s2">pressed into you know square pegs</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.680" style="s2">and it just didn&#39;t work out for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.650" end="00:33:45.210" style="s2">like Alexandra tried to make advances in</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.680" end="00:33:48.630" style="s2">neuroscience directly but she couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.210" end="00:33:51.180" style="s2">right she had to pivot into linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.630" end="00:33:52.770" style="s2">if you read her bio biography and her</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.180" end="00:33:54.930" style="s2">terminology is super weird and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.770" end="00:33:57.150" style="s2">idiosyncratic right like if we unpack</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.930" end="00:33:58.860" style="s2">what she means by God and what she means</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.150" end="00:34:01.140" style="s2">by what his talents position at the head</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.860" end="00:34:03.650" style="s2">of the Communist Party it probably would</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.140" end="00:34:11.130" style="s2">end up being something reasonable right</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.650" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">or not awesome great and I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.130" end="00:34:15.750" style="s2">this question on behalf of Evelyn my</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">definition our live players appear</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.750" end="00:34:20.820" style="s2">category or our live players and dead</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:24.060" style="s2">players like poles between MIT which</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.820" end="00:34:26.130" style="s2">most people fall they&#39;re poles but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.060" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s a bimodal</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.130" end="00:34:32.070" style="s2">distribution and it&#39;s very heavily</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:33.810" style="s2">skewed towards dead players so dead here</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.070" end="00:34:36.030" style="s2">means strategically dead it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.810" end="00:34:38.370" style="s2">physically dead you can enjoy and live a</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.030" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">very nice life following scripts</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.370" end="00:34:43.890" style="s2">following routines it can be experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:45.540" style="s2">rich it&#39;s certainly valuable but from a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.890" end="00:34:47.340" style="s2">strategic perspective imagine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.540" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">playing the equivalent of a video game</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:52.740" style="s2">or a multi-sided board game and you look</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:54.420" style="s2">around the table and you see okay at</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.740" end="00:34:56.460" style="s2">that part of the table there&#39;s no human</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.420" end="00:34:58.620" style="s2">there&#39;s just a piece of paper with some</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.460" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">basic instructions and if and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.620" end="00:35:03.630" style="s2">clauses and there&#39;s only one or two</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:05.610" style="s2">other people sitting at the table you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.630" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">know that that game only has two or</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.610" end="00:35:09.630" style="s2">three live players and the live players</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:12.030" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t necessarily agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.630" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">with each other and I also believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.030" end="00:35:17.010" style="s2">possible to lose hope at one point in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:19.350" style="s2">life so it is possible to just become a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.010" end="00:35:21.260" style="s2">dead player or awaken from being a dead</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.350" end="00:35:23.310" style="s2">player to becoming a live player but</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.260" end="00:35:25.860" style="s2">prepare yourself for things becoming</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.310" end="00:35:28.710" style="s2">very strange if you do very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.860" end="00:35:33.000" style="s2">consensus reality starts 10 you know it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:34.080" style="s2">starts falling apart right so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.000" end="00:35:36.780" style="s2">bimodal</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.080" end="00:35:39.090" style="s2">it is a spectrum I think stepping out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.780" end="00:35:40.830" style="s2">consensus is a strong attractor I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.090" end="00:35:43.140" style="s2">stepping into consensus is a strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.830" end="00:35:45.390" style="s2">attractor just psychologically but also</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.140" end="00:35:46.860" style="s2">information theory wise right if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.390" end="00:35:49.020" style="s2">rely on normal channels of information</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.860" end="00:35:51.060" style="s2">you become more normal over time even if</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.020" end="00:35:53.100" style="s2">your original at first if you rely on</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.060" end="00:35:57.320" style="s2">abnormal channels of information you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.100" end="00:35:57.320" style="s2">become more more distinct more unusual</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.890" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:06.900" style="s2">Coleman would you like to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:09.960" style="s2">yeah hey I liked it I like the concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.900" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">and I&#39;ve definitely seen it where I feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.960" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">like I can kind of predict their</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:18.840" style="s2">reaction to certain things but my</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:21.390" style="s2">question is if there any particular like</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.840" end="00:36:23.790" style="s2">impressive case studies have a live</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.390" end="00:36:27.260" style="s2">player like moves that you found</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.790" end="00:36:31.020" style="s2">particularly inspiring or interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.260" end="00:36:33.270" style="s2">mean there are lots of people um I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.020" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">that if you you know if you go read</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.270" end="00:36:37.710" style="s2">about Paul Kagame I find him someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:39.300" style="s2">inspiring right where he stabilized the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.710" end="00:36:41.220" style="s2">country that had gone through genocide</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.300" end="00:36:43.140" style="s2">and achieved not just prosperity but</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.220" end="00:36:46.050" style="s2">reconciliation between the Tutsi and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.140" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">Hutu right so he&#39;s a contemporary life</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.050" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">player</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:52.710" style="s2">I think historical case studies lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:54.120" style="s2">them I&#39;ve done lots of them and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.710" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">afraid you&#39;re just gonna have to wait</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.120" end="00:36:58.350" style="s2">for more of the stuff to be released my</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:37:01.160" style="s2">biggest bottleneck is always writing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.350" end="00:37:03.960" style="s2">a slow cautious writer faster researcher</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.160" end="00:37:05.580" style="s2">but had done case studies on historical</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.960" end="00:37:09.600" style="s2">life players such as Catherine the Great</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.580" end="00:37:12.170" style="s2">and freed rate the grade but also you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.600" end="00:37:15.210" style="s2">know also some some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.170" end="00:37:21.780" style="s2">people like you know Rosa Luxemburg and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.210" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">so on right so I think you could choose</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.780" end="00:37:26.370" style="s2">biographies of many people I think in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">the West you know Churchill is popular</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.370" end="00:37:32.910" style="s2">to read about I think that Lincoln is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">certainly acceptable but ideally you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.910" end="00:37:36.630" style="s2">read something about someone from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:39.360" style="s2">really different culture or from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.630" end="00:37:42.870" style="s2">really different environment and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.360" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">someone who is in as close a position as</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.870" end="00:37:48.990" style="s2">you might find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:53.670" style="s2">hope that makes sense like awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.990" end="00:37:58.980" style="s2">thank you yeah great and Jen do you want</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.670" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2">to ask a question I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.980" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">I can ask it better than I wrote it so</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:07.980" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna read out my question what</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.799" style="s2">what unites otherwise very different</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.980" end="00:38:13.410" style="s2">live players what&#39;s the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.799" end="00:38:15.619" style="s2">factor is it the outcomes they generate</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.410" end="00:38:18.180" style="s2">or the method in which they operate I</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.619" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s the method I think the method</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.180" end="00:38:23.819" style="s2">is this they display this adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:27.569" style="s2">right this adaptability to circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.819" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">where the circumstance isn&#39;t such as own</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.569" end="00:38:32.339" style="s2">a new competitor as arisen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:34.549" style="s2">something like our industry is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.339" end="00:38:37.109" style="s2">irrelevant our industry has gone away or</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.549" end="00:38:38.970" style="s2">there&#39;s been an economic crash or hey</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.109" end="00:38:42.329" style="s2">there&#39;s been a global pandemic or</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.970" end="00:38:44.549" style="s2">shipping is delayed for six months right</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.329" end="00:38:47.549" style="s2">for I am delayed for six months I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.549" end="00:38:49.470" style="s2">stuck outside the country I really have</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.549" end="00:38:51.690" style="s2">to emphasize that you know it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.470" end="00:38:54.470" style="s2">outlier events that often reveal who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.690" end="00:38:56.849" style="s2">alive and and who&#39;s who&#39;s dead player</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.470" end="00:38:58.980" style="s2">because you will see which institutions</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.849" end="00:39:00.329" style="s2">are piloted by the live players because</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.980" end="00:39:02.250" style="s2">those are the ones they&#39;re going to not</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.329" end="00:39:05.039" style="s2">only survive but to thrive under</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.250" end="00:39:07.049" style="s2">adversity right I really don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.039" end="00:39:08.849" style="s2">use the term anti fragile here so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.049" end="00:39:12.119" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna say that I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.849" end="00:39:14.099" style="s2">use that term but that should drive the</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.099" end="00:39:21.660" style="s2">it I think that their commonalities I</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.319" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">would downplay I think there&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.000" end="00:40:07.350" style="s2">you might think that it&#39;s your duty as</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.530" end="00:40:09.960" style="s2">the president of Russia and so on - like</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.350" end="00:40:11.880" style="s2">maintain a stable independent country</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.960" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">and safeguard the interests in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.880" end="00:40:15.750" style="s2">traditions of the Russian people except</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.220" style="s2">you just actually believe instead of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.750" end="00:40:19.830" style="s2">having been this kind of surface thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.220" end="00:40:22.610" style="s2">that you&#39;re supposed to believe so</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.830" end="00:40:25.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a moral justification for action</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.610" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">because interestingly I think people if</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.980" end="00:40:31.530" style="s2">they believe it&#39;s not their place to act</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.260" end="00:40:33.180" style="s2">they don&#39;t now of course just because a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.530" end="00:40:34.590" style="s2">belief is there and beat just because</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.180" end="00:40:36.810" style="s2">it&#39;s strong enough that the person is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.590" end="00:40:39.300" style="s2">life player it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.810" end="00:40:41.700" style="s2">objectively true right it or at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.300" end="00:40:43.500" style="s2">according to our value systems it might</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.700" end="00:40:46.170" style="s2">not be right I certainly don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.500" end="00:40:51.420" style="s2">with everything with gee-gees your pain</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.170" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">right or if Vladimir Putin but I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.420" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">think that they find those</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:40:58.140" style="s2">justifications very compelling do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:00.870" style="s2">think it&#39;s almost necessary then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.140" end="00:41:03.170" style="s2">an element of delusion or irrationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.870" end="00:41:05.580" style="s2">yeah there is an element of delusion or</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.170" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">irrationality but I think this is this</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.580" end="00:41:09.540" style="s2">is the destiny and I think all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:11.820" style="s2">right like we are incomplete Minds I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.540" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">think we&#39;re much more competent Minds</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.820" end="00:41:16.710" style="s2">than we usually think we are I moved</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">over the years very much away from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.710" end="00:41:20.760" style="s2">rationalist conception of you know human</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:24.980" style="s2">minds is inherently broken or like</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.760" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2">flawed or biased I think that with</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.980" end="00:41:29.250" style="s2">self-examination and reflection but not</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:31.410" style="s2">just self-examination like work on</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.250" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">difficult problems I think human minds</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.410" end="00:41:36.330" style="s2">can become super super impressive super</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">formidable but I really want to point</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.330" end="00:41:40.740" style="s2">out here though that this irrationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:43.710" style="s2">that the live players do is mirrored by</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.740" end="00:41:45.360" style="s2">an irrationality of the dead players who</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.710" end="00:41:48.990" style="s2">in fact believe that they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.360" end="00:41:51.450" style="s2">act they believe that they personally</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.990" end="00:41:54.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have to act it&#39;s as much of cope</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.450" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">on the inactive side as it is on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.120" end="00:41:59.460" style="s2">active side imagine one side has the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:01.410" style="s2">button you know the light is broken and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.460" end="00:42:03.560" style="s2">it always shows green and the other side</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.410" end="00:42:05.610" style="s2">has a broken light that always shows red</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.560" end="00:42:07.710" style="s2">both of them are disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.610" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">reality and we disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.710" end="00:42:11.700" style="s2">benefit from the few that have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:17.620" style="s2">broken green light</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.700" end="00:42:19.360" style="s2">if I could ask a follow-up as well this</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.620" end="00:42:21.850" style="s2">is kind of a half form of thought but</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.360" end="00:42:23.890" style="s2">let&#39;s say this is a new concept for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.850" end="00:42:25.870" style="s2">and I&#39;ve learned this from you I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.890" end="00:42:30.760" style="s2">to ask a question about the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.870" end="00:42:34.810" style="s2">actionability of this like in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.760" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">is there a survival bias to being a live</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.810" end="00:42:39.010" style="s2">player I always think of the exam oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">yeah massive like if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.010" end="00:42:43.240" style="s2">private equity firm like TPG and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:45.820" style="s2">look at the guy who started it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.240" end="00:42:47.710" style="s2">David Bonderman like was a lawyer doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.820" end="00:42:49.840" style="s2">Arabic stuff in the Middle East for 12</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.710" end="00:42:52.060" style="s2">years and then was in Texas with some</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.840" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">rancher and it&#39;s just like so random you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.060" end="00:42:55.630" style="s2">look at the number two guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:57.490" style="s2">ATPG and it&#39;s like Baker Scholar Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.630" end="00:42:59.710" style="s2">like partner at Goldman Sachs it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.490" end="00:43:02.590" style="s2">like a perfect resume you just think if</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.710" end="00:43:04.390" style="s2">you ran that reality again it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.590" end="00:43:06.250" style="s2">improbable than that first guy would</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.390" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">maybe he would just be some random dude</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.250" end="00:43:10.150" style="s2">in the Middle East but that second guy</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:12.100" style="s2">or maybe maybe he&#39;d be a random dude in</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.150" end="00:43:13.960" style="s2">the Middle East or maybe he&#39;d become a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.100" end="00:43:16.990" style="s2">hunger may be he become a Ukrainian</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.960" end="00:43:19.120" style="s2">politician or maybe he&#39;d been a Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.990" end="00:43:21.490" style="s2">novelist I&#39;m actually gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.120" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">something if someone masters several</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.490" end="00:43:27.700" style="s2">careers to a high degree consequentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:29.320" style="s2">but gets super improbable right say</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.700" end="00:43:32.410" style="s2">Arnold Schwarzenegger being both an</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.320" end="00:43:34.060" style="s2">extremely good bodybuilder and running</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.410" end="00:43:36.580" style="s2">for governor and succeeding I bet if</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.060" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">Yuri ran history all over again from</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.580" end="00:43:40.930" style="s2">Arnold Schwarzenegger is birth he might</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:43.030" style="s2">become president of Austria he might</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.930" end="00:43:44.950" style="s2">become a head of a technological</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.530" end="00:43:51.310" style="s2">might become the head of a mercenary</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.180" end="00:43:54.490" style="s2">outfit or he might become a Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.310" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">actor all over again right meanwhile I</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.490" end="00:43:59.620" style="s2">think that if he ran the universe where</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:02.080" style="s2">the person that you know has the super</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.620" end="00:44:04.930" style="s2">nice sounding cookie cutter standard</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.080" end="00:44:08.380" style="s2">career you know you rerun that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.930" end="00:44:10.060" style="s2">career in a different world I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.380" end="00:44:12.820" style="s2">there&#39;s still a very high grade</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.060" end="00:44:14.680" style="s2">careerist but they ultimately are</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.820" end="00:44:16.750" style="s2">climbing ladders they&#39;re not building</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.680" end="00:44:19.360" style="s2">ladders right to climbing someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.750" end="00:44:21.010" style="s2">ladder someone else designed that career</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.360" end="00:44:24.109" style="s2">track for them it wasn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.010" end="00:44:25.880" style="s2">objective right Harvard&#39;s not objective</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.109" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">the career tracks are not objective</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.880" end="00:44:30.109" style="s2">they&#39;re arbitrary at their very best</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.900" style="s2">they can be the equivalent to the roman</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.109" end="00:44:34.670" style="s2">courses on Arum which is the sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.900" end="00:44:37.549" style="s2">posts you make people go through to show</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.670" end="00:44:39.619" style="s2">their worth but the exact obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.549" end="00:44:44.599" style="s2">course is super arbitrary right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.619" end="00:44:46.489" style="s2">super contingent yeah so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.599" end="00:44:49.849" style="s2">that&#39;s what I always say right and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.489" end="00:44:51.890" style="s2">note when you rerun the universe does</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.849" end="00:44:54.679" style="s2">that person really out-compete other</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.890" end="00:44:56.809" style="s2">people who are super similar maybe that</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.809" end="00:45:00.739" style="s2">also improbably that person to get at</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.179" end="00:45:03.289" style="s2">the end of the cookie cutter career had</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.739" end="00:45:05.479" style="s2">to out-compete a thousand or ten</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.289" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">thousand or fifty thousand people trying</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:14.420" style="s2">player only need to out-compete no two</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:15.890" style="s2">three people maybe so if I&#39;m if I could</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.420" end="00:45:17.929" style="s2">paraphrase what I&#39;m getting from you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.890" end="00:45:20.569" style="s2">this live player concept isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.929" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">necessarily only helpful as an analysis</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.569" end="00:45:25.099" style="s2">tool it&#39;s potentially helpful also as</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:26.900" style="s2">like a personal action tool it could</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.099" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">give you extra confidence if you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.900" end="00:45:32.179" style="s2">different we&#39;re the costume dead being</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.769" style="s2">welding like that you killed like like</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.179" end="00:45:37.339" style="s2">literally Soviet dissidents right there</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.769" end="00:45:38.809" style="s2">were life players right or it might you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.339" end="00:45:43.429" style="s2">might you might become a billionaire or</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.809" end="00:45:45.259" style="s2">something and or you might end up being</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.259" end="00:45:50.689" style="s2">time and just look like a miserable</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.109" end="00:45:51.949" style="s2">until that right so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.689" end="00:45:53.660" style="s2">difference between being a live player</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.949" end="00:45:56.269" style="s2">and simply going for higher risk higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.660" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">reward I mean I always think of that Joe</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.269" end="00:46:00.650" style="s2">Hinrich thing like tradition is smarter</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.150" style="s2">than you like most of the time when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.650" end="00:46:03.619" style="s2">question tradition you like the base</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.150" end="00:46:04.999" style="s2">rate is you&#39;re going to be wrong there</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.619" end="00:46:08.859" style="s2">is a lot of accumulated wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.999" end="00:46:08.859" style="s2">tradition so what&#39;s the difference there</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.579" end="00:46:13.609" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to describe from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:15.410" style="s2">inside but super apparent that some</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.609" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">people routinely outperform tradition</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.410" end="00:46:19.880" style="s2">well I think I think what they actually</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.109" end="00:46:59.569" style="s2">because I think that connection is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.900" end="00:47:01.910" style="s2">heroin for people right they love being</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.569" end="00:47:04.220" style="s2">close to other individuals and if it</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.910" end="00:47:06.440" style="s2">means smothering over awkward ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.220" end="00:47:08.810" style="s2">be so close to others I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.440" end="00:47:10.670" style="s2">human nature that we do this so it says</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.810" end="00:47:13.670" style="s2">if you actually think I&#39;m flipping the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.670" end="00:47:15.410" style="s2">usual sheep thing on its head usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.670" end="00:47:17.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a complain that he of humans are</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.410" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">sheep this is bad they&#39;re just cowardly</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.780" end="00:47:23.569" style="s2">I actually think it might be this desire</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.569" end="00:47:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;s the love that causes people to be</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.260" end="00:47:30.980" style="s2">probably coming from a positive not from</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.910" end="00:47:33.710" style="s2">a negative impulse though fear can also</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.710" end="00:47:37.490" style="s2">I think most of the lack of variation</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.869" end="00:47:39.560" style="s2">that we see this kind of clustering and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.490" end="00:47:41.470" style="s2">human distributions I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.560" end="00:47:46.430" style="s2">because of our desire for connection</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.470" end="00:47:48.619" style="s2">essentially right people sometimes want</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.430" end="00:47:51.349" style="s2">to be great writers because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.619" end="00:47:53.810" style="s2">be closer in spirit to the writer that</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.420" end="00:48:04.069" style="s2">develop deep empathy that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.470" end="00:49:08.299" style="s2">all right my question is what are some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.279" end="00:49:10.940" style="s2">strange outlandish or eccentric skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.299" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">that live players of the future are</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.940" end="00:49:19.099" style="s2">starting to learn and study today well</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:25.099" style="s2">you know the crucial the crucial thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.099" end="00:49:28.369" style="s2">here is that I think it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.099" end="00:49:30.410" style="s2">very different I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.369" end="00:49:34.249" style="s2">that&#39;s probably happening right now is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:36.229" style="s2">that people who have reinvented by</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.249" end="00:49:39.890" style="s2">accident at least the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.229" end="00:49:42.229" style="s2">that is people who know how to set up</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.890" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">theories and set up experiments on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.229" end="00:49:47.450" style="s2">basis of theories they have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:49.789" style="s2">advantage right now because their</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.450" end="00:49:52.279" style="s2">society is overloaded with scientism and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.789" end="00:49:53.989" style="s2">essentially fake science but it&#39;s fake</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.279" end="00:49:57.739" style="s2">science with the Harvard degree attached</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.989" end="00:49:59.210" style="s2">to it so you can&#39;t call it fake there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.739" end="00:50:01.099" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s I think it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.210" end="00:50:03.559" style="s2">much damning for example the use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.099" end="00:50:05.930" style="s2">statistics in medicine right or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.559" end="00:50:08.930" style="s2">recent replication crisis we are as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.930" end="00:50:11.809" style="s2">society cargo cult informal methods on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.930" end="00:50:14.029" style="s2">truly massive scale because we you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.809" end="00:50:15.769" style="s2">we demanded that there be a massive</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.029" end="00:50:17.660" style="s2">expansion of scientists after the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.769" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">Sputnik moment right the launch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.660" end="00:50:24.440" style="s2">Sputnik in the 1950s and you know much</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:27.079" style="s2">as the Soviet shoe manufacturer that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.440" end="00:50:30.440" style="s2">given insufficient leather by the</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.229" end="00:50:38.390" style="s2">tiny shoes that are useless because on</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.960" end="00:50:41.239" style="s2">paper they fill the quota I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.390" end="00:50:43.489" style="s2">made tiny tiny PhDs to fill the quota</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.239" end="00:50:46.729" style="s2">that allows us to claim they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.489" end="00:50:48.829" style="s2">thriving scientific society right so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.729" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">think real science when you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.829" end="00:50:52.729" style="s2">very powerful very important done by</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:55.880" style="s2">very few people</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.729" end="00:50:58.339" style="s2">the second thing is capitalism actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.880" end="00:51:00.010" style="s2">doing capitalism super rare very</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.339" end="00:51:02.680" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.010" end="00:51:03.850" style="s2">this is kind of what Peter teal writes a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.680" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">lot about this I think he&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.850" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">right I also think doing Marxism for</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:14.350" style="s2">done societal analysis plus trying to</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.260" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">like creating a new socio-economic order</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.360" end="00:51:26.470" style="s2">people were so invested in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.880" end="00:51:28.900" style="s2">Bolsheviks because the Bolsheviks were</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.470" end="00:51:30.670" style="s2">the equivalent of like a high IQ cult</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.900" end="00:51:33.370" style="s2">when they were founded right that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.670" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">I was so enticing not only do you get a</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.370" end="00:51:36.070" style="s2">hang out with your friends and read the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:37.960" style="s2">same books your friends have been</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.960" end="00:51:41.710" style="s2">betterment of all of society and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.180" end="00:51:43.690" style="s2">was super appealing to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.710" end="00:51:47.080" style="s2">sometimes already very well off or not</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.690" end="00:51:48.940" style="s2">themselves proletariat and again like</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.940" end="00:51:53.320" style="s2">the Bolshevik Revolution made the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.950" end="00:51:55.570" style="s2">better though I certainly think Vladimir</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.320" end="00:51:57.490" style="s2">Lenin is like absolutely a great founder</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.570" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">type character because he invented the</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.020" end="00:52:23.140" style="s2">ability to read things slowly and think</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.650" end="00:52:40.540" style="s2">50 years something has happened where</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.170" end="00:52:41.950" style="s2">even the five percent is like vastly too</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.540" end="00:52:44.440" style="s2">many I think right now it&#39;s like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.950" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">like half a percent or 1 percent it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.440" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2">might&#39;ve been the rise of visual culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:51.250" style="s2">right that might have been the reason or</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:56.140" style="s2">it might have been the attention</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.580" end="00:53:12.830" style="s2">reading comprehension the writing has</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">gotten orders</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.830" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">compared a scientific paper in the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:21.770" style="s2">complex field you can find from 1925 to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:25.430" style="s2">a modern scientific paper in the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.770" end="00:53:27.320" style="s2">trivial field you can find the 1925</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.430" end="00:53:29.120" style="s2">paper will be more intelligible and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.320" end="00:53:31.250" style="s2">understandable because it&#39;s written for</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.120" end="00:53:33.550" style="s2">a person right the modern scientific</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.250" end="00:53:35.870" style="s2">paper is usually written for a committee</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.550" end="00:53:37.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s trying to be defensive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.870" end="00:53:40.220" style="s2">trying to be small it&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.880" end="00:53:42.470" style="s2">convey it&#39;s not expecting there&#39;s a mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.220" end="00:53:44.410" style="s2">on the other end that&#39;s doing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.470" end="00:53:47.000" style="s2">expecting to be evaluated as homework</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.410" end="00:53:50.530" style="s2">the difference between a homework and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.000" end="00:53:55.130" style="s2">research on a deep deep level is unclear</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.530" end="00:53:56.510" style="s2">right so I don&#39;t mean to be picking on</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.130" end="00:53:58.310" style="s2">academia obviously I think there&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.510" end="00:54:00.050" style="s2">work that sometimes happens in corners</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.310" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">of academia but I&#39;m trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.050" end="00:54:03.710" style="s2">that there&#39;s something deeply wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.080" style="s2">the way we read and it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.710" end="00:54:09.080" style="s2">to convey so maybe that&#39;s intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.080" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">dark matter reading but for real because</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.080" end="00:54:13.010" style="s2">believe me if you read books for real</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:16.460" style="s2">and you act on them you get very weird</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.010" end="00:54:19.880" style="s2">very quickly I hope that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.460" end="00:54:22.450" style="s2">answer to your question yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.880" end="00:54:22.450" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.050" end="00:54:31.250" style="s2">excellent we&#39;re really winding down here</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:33.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we have time for well</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.250" end="00:54:35.870" style="s2">Jacob has a question that is about</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.230" end="00:54:37.730" style="s2">success Jacob do you wanna ask a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.870" end="00:54:40.010" style="s2">question and squeeze it in in the last</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.730" end="00:54:47.570" style="s2">few minutes sorry I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.010" end="00:54:49.250" style="s2">answer your last so so I guess if my</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.570" end="00:54:51.140" style="s2">intuition is that we&#39;re putting the cart</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.250" end="00:54:52.910" style="s2">before the horse like that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.140" end="00:54:55.100" style="s2">have some sort of relatively</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.910" end="00:54:57.710" style="s2">comprehensive unified definition of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.100" end="00:55:01.010" style="s2">success right because for example like</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.710" end="00:55:04.490" style="s2">speaking of outlandish I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.010" end="00:55:06.050" style="s2">think that Elon Musk is a live player I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.490" end="00:55:08.810" style="s2">don&#39;t think I actually don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.050" end="00:55:10.040" style="s2">successful by my by my standard sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.810" end="00:55:12.140" style="s2">well you know that that&#39;s not landish</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.040" end="00:55:14.060" style="s2">obviously but that&#39;s just a case in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.140" end="00:55:18.110" style="s2">point of don&#39;t we have to first exam</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.060" end="00:55:19.940" style="s2">little it&#39;s not Jeff well I&#39;m not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.110" end="00:55:23.530" style="s2">successful right I&#39;m just saying they go</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.940" end="00:55:27.670" style="s2">off script and buy successful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.530" end="00:55:30.380" style="s2">they achieve what they set out to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.670" end="00:55:32.270" style="s2">right note that for 4life players I</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:34.070" style="s2">listed people with whose objectives I</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.270" end="00:55:36.560" style="s2">disagree so it&#39;s not like I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.070" end="00:55:38.270" style="s2">there&#39;s an objective single measure I</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.560" end="00:55:40.070" style="s2">think there are multiple possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.270" end="00:55:43.820" style="s2">agendas people could be pursuing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.070" end="00:55:46.460" style="s2">what I&#39;m what is looked at here is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.820" end="00:55:49.820" style="s2">this can really outlier human skill and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.460" end="00:55:51.560" style="s2">outlier human impact so if that feels</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.820" end="00:55:54.830" style="s2">more accurate and I think it probably is</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.560" end="00:55:57.620" style="s2">we can say outlier impact outlier human</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.830" end="00:55:59.900" style="s2">skill rather than success like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.620" end="00:56:05.060" style="s2">happy to substitute those words to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.900" end="00:56:07.340" style="s2">that that&#39;s not great and with that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.060" end="00:56:09.020" style="s2">think we&#39;ll have to wrap up here thank</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.340" end="00:56:10.610" style="s2">you so much Sam oh and I&#39;m so glad that</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.140" style="s2">and also I hope people can tell this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.280" end="00:56:27.070" style="s2">not scripted I was just trying my best</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.140" end="00:56:29.360" style="s2">to live answer the questions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.070" end="00:56:31.640" style="s2">sometimes you know the reality of things</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.360" end="00:56:34.430" style="s2">how simple things are can seem</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.640" end="00:56:37.430" style="s2">outlandish so hope everyone has a good</p>
