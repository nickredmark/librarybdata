<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">day like today is a sit day we NEET I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">sometimes a bit of review I&#39;ll do better</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">for you today and then we sit together</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">and then there&#39;s QA the fact there&#39;s Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">at the end of every class Monday through</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">Friday the Q&amp;A is through on the sick</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">days Tuesday to Friday tend to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">little longer it except for Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">because we have a very hard closing time</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">on Thursday to end right at 10:00 that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">Thursday so as I said welcome so</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.009" end="00:01:52.820" style="s2">yesterday I reviewed how to apply the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">five factors of inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.820" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">when you&#39;re working on your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">today I want to review something I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">talked about on Monday which is dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">with hindrances and so the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:05.159" style="s2">hindrances is not things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">happening in your practice that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.159" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">disruptive to it but things are that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">disrupting your attempt to do your</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">practice and I mentioned that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">sort of two kinds of resist</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:17.819" style="s2">since to practice that we face one is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">very active resistance you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.819" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">getting this dog no don&#39;t like I said so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">that might be something that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">to trauma or some deeper issues that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:32.190" style="s2">need to be explored therapeutically and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">so again I don&#39;t know you that might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.190" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">something you might want to consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">exploring often though it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">something that we can deal with more</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">directly by this practice of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">already meditating and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">is when the resistance comes up don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">meditate then immediately apply the five</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">factors implying mindfulness - it might</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:55.620" style="s2">perhaps direct Metta towards it so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">you find yourself already in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.620" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">practice already meditating and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">it&#39;s you sort of slowly transition into</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">your sitted practice in some fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">that technique of you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">meditating is how we try to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:12.569" style="s2">that very active resistance now the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">in this video is kind of passive</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.569" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">resistance is when we oh I should</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">meditate and our motivation just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">leaks away from us I mean we just go</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">into a bit of a fog and we drift off let</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">me think about doing other things and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">that is something that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:34.440" style="s2">built up sort of significant habits not</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">to counteract and the way we do this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">what&#39;s called the three jewels or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:40.019" style="s2">three refuges which is sort of the core</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:42.060" style="s2">of Buddhism again I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.019" end="00:03:48.359" style="s2">convert you I don&#39;t even think I myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.060" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">am a Buddhist but what are these three</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.359" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">practices well it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">Buddha is not sort of venerating or</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">worshipping hearted Gotama although</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.359" style="s2">learning about human reading you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">what he has to say can be very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.359" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">remembering the Buddha is to keep I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">would suggest keeping a journal where</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:17.000" style="s2">you try</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">certain moments where you had an</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.000" end="00:04:21.709" style="s2">existential insight especially about</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:24.170" style="s2">yourself as opposed to other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.709" end="00:04:27.050" style="s2">right a moment where you came into</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.170" end="00:04:28.700" style="s2">mindfulness or spontaneously and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.050" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">moments when you remembered to practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.700" end="00:04:33.710" style="s2">and apply to these are all moments when</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:35.390" style="s2">your inner teacher is making itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.710" end="00:04:37.760" style="s2">present to you and present through you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.390" end="00:04:39.050" style="s2">and so by noting those and remembering</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.760" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">them and reviewing them periodically</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.050" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger here about narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">and oh look at our special item so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">have to keep that in mind you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">approach this as always right with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">humility always with humility but</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">celebrating in an appropriate sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:56.150" style="s2">it&#39;s called watering your Buddha this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:57.860" style="s2">sense of the inner teacher so the inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.150" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">teacher is more and more invited to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.860" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">more and more present to you and through</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:07.880" style="s2">you until eventually like the way when</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:09.770" style="s2">somebody&#39;s learning a sport they they</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.880" end="00:05:11.750" style="s2">imitate their coach they internalize the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.770" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">coach until eventually they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.750" end="00:05:16.100" style="s2">the coach because the coach and to them</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:19.490" style="s2">have been integrated into their</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.100" end="00:05:22.250" style="s2">awareness and their skill so grow your</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.490" end="00:05:23.810" style="s2">Buddha Dharma Dharma these are like when</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.250" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">teaching you thoughts of Dharma learning</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.810" end="00:05:27.979" style="s2">about this reading books about</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">mindfulness if you&#39;re interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.979" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">broader framework reading books around</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:34.010" style="s2">Buddhist philosophy or Buddhist ritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:35.479" style="s2">practice so the more you can learn the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.010" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">morning people learning in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.479" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">your brain associates the practice with</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:42.830" style="s2">learning and opening up the field of its</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:44.660" style="s2">capacity to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.830" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">the more the brain will pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.660" end="00:05:49.010" style="s2">motivation to continue to practice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:50.180" style="s2">the third is the Sangha</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.010" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">this is also saying that we&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.180" end="00:05:54.640" style="s2">together with other people we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">so human beings are incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.640" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2">socio-cultural animals so much so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:01.850" style="s2">this tends to be the reliable factor and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:03.140" style="s2">we&#39;re triangle because we&#39;re setting</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.850" end="00:06:05.660" style="s2">this up the way we&#39;re doing we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.140" end="00:06:06.950" style="s2">to create a community of Sangha around</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.660" end="00:06:11.090" style="s2">it well they&#39;re trying to what we can to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.950" end="00:06:13.130" style="s2">keep it going because right if you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.090" end="00:06:15.950" style="s2">practicing and sort of totally isolated</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.130" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">fashion chances are within about five</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.950" end="00:06:17.630" style="s2">weeks you won&#39;t be practicing this</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.260" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">sensations or emotions at times it may</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.330" end="00:32:52.150" style="s2">feel almost as numbness well that as I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:54.700" style="s2">mentioned that happens for people so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.150" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">numbness means you mean a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.700" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">sort of that was to grab yours to</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:01.210" style="s2">potentials because you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:04.360" style="s2">there could be like I say there could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.210" end="00:33:06.160" style="s2">trauma there could be issues from your</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.360" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">past there&#39;s lots of stuff that could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.160" end="00:33:13.740" style="s2">happening to you so I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:16.809" style="s2">but sort of a statistical norm is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.740" end="00:33:20.280" style="s2">people have been there they have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.809" end="00:33:24.370" style="s2">over identified with one particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.280" end="00:33:28.809" style="s2">aspect way in which they do that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.370" end="00:33:32.410" style="s2">are in existential mode and it&#39;s and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.809" end="00:33:33.850" style="s2">it takes time to open up and noticing</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.410" end="00:33:35.770" style="s2">the numbness and I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.850" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">insult you please please I&#39;m sorry I</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:46.360" style="s2">right so paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.740" end="00:33:51.730" style="s2">numbness and sitting with it and trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.360" end="00:33:52.540" style="s2">to feel as much as you can just what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.730" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">your mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.540" end="00:34:00.929" style="s2">what your mind and body doing in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:34:03.850" style="s2">and how might this be in the background</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.929" end="00:34:06.010" style="s2">as you&#39;re moving around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.850" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">well how would it dispose you to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.010" end="00:34:12.460" style="s2">yourself and see other people right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:13.990" style="s2">and then what can sometimes happen is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.460" end="00:34:15.220" style="s2">people will sort of snap into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.990" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">situation in their mind where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.220" end="00:34:21.099" style="s2">confronting people that they feel in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:25.570" style="s2">contrast what it&#39;s like so try that see</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.099" end="00:34:27.129" style="s2">if that gives you any progress and be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.570" end="00:34:29.230" style="s2">even remember good friend yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.129" end="00:34:32.349" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t come back and ask the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.230" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">question again maybe reframe it a bit as</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.690" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">mention that when I was teaching you</p>
