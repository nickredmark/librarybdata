<p begin="00:00:00.640" end="00:00:02.320" style="s2">Hi</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.320" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">I&#39;m in the dressing room at the Palace Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on June 14th</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.440" end="00:00:09.849" style="s2">2018 and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.849" end="00:00:16.769" style="s2">I thought I&#39;d read you an excerpt from maps of meaning the architecture of belief which is a book I published</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.380" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">in 99 with Routledge and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.859" end="00:00:24.749" style="s2">It&#39;s been the basis of my YouTube lectures and I would say also</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.090" end="00:00:30.719" style="s2">Twelve rules for life a lot of the ideas and twelve rules for life were first worked out with maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">I just recorded an audio version of the book was released two days ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.100" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">June 12 2008 een and</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.640" end="00:00:44.459" style="s2">It&#39;s available from Penguin Books on audible. I&#39;ll put the links in the description of the video</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.950" end="00:00:48.179" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that the audio version with its</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.059" end="00:00:55.109" style="s2">Careful intonation will be easier to understand maps of meaning is a rather difficult book</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.199" end="00:00:59.849" style="s2">in any case I&#39;m going to read you an excerpt from it today and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.579" end="00:01:02.669" style="s2">That&#39;ll serve as a bit of an introduction to the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.829" end="00:01:07.859" style="s2">I&#39;ll make some more excerpts over the next coming weeks I think as well, but we&#39;ll start with this one. I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.790" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">Was reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:18.599" style="s2">Jeffrey Burton Russell&#39;s mephistopheles the devil in the modern world when I came across his discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.420" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s The Brothers Karamazov</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.110" end="00:01:29.279" style="s2">Russell discusses Ivan&#39;s argument for atheism, which is one of the most powerful ever mounted</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.009" end="00:01:32.039" style="s2">Ivan is one of the brothers in The Brothers Karamazov</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.640" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">Ivan&#39;s examples of evil all taken from the daily newspapers of 1876 are unforgettable</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.049" end="00:01:45.809" style="s2">The nobleman who orders his hounds to tear the peasant boy to pieces in front of his mother</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">The man who whips his struggling horse on its gentle eyes</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.290" end="00:01:57.089" style="s2">The parents who locked their tiny daughter all night in the freezing privy while she knocks on the walls pleading for mercy</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.579" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">The Turk who entertains a baby with a shiny pistol before blowing its brains out</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.939" end="00:02:08.309" style="s2">Ivan knows that such horrors of kur daily and can be multiplied without end</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:14.140" style="s2">I took the case of children Ivan explains to make case clearer</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.570" end="00:02:19.119" style="s2">Of the other tears with which the earth is soaked. I will say nothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.870" end="00:02:22.870" style="s2">Burton Russell states</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:29.770" style="s2">the relation of evil to God has in the century of Auschwitz and Hiroshima once again become center of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.140" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">philosophical and theological discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.900" end="00:02:35.530" style="s2">The problem of evil can be stated simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.050" end="00:02:37.700" style="s2">God is omnipotent</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.700" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">God is perfectly good</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.890" end="00:02:42.190" style="s2">Such a God would not permit evil to exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.920" end="00:02:47.740" style="s2">But we observe that evil exists. Therefore. God does not exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.490" end="00:02:51.490" style="s2">Variations on this theme are nearly infinite</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:58.270" style="s2">The problem is not only abstract and philosophical. Of course. It is also personal and immediate</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.940" end="00:03:05.859" style="s2">Believers tend to forget that their God takes away everything that one cares about possessions comforts success</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.739" end="00:03:08.739" style="s2">professional craft knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.110" end="00:03:11.110" style="s2">friends family and life</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.480" end="00:03:13.869" style="s2">What kind of God is this any?</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.450" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">Decent religion must face this question squarely and no answer is credible that cannot be given in the face of dying children</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.220" end="00:03:30.220" style="s2">It seems to me that we use the horrors of the world to justify our own inadequacies</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:36.399" style="s2">We make the presumption that human vulnerability is a sufficient cause of human cruelty</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.860" end="00:03:44.709" style="s2">we blame God and God&#39;s creation for twisting and perverting our souls and claim all the time to be innocent victims of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.840" end="00:03:46.840" style="s2">circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.180" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">What do you say to a dying child</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.360" end="00:03:52.220" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.220" end="00:03:57.759" style="s2">You can do it. There is something in you that is strong enough to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:05.650" style="s2">you don&#39;t use the terrible vulnerability of children as an excuse for the rejection of existence and the perpetration of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">conscious evil</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.590" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">When I wrote maps of meaning I did not have much experience as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.440" end="00:04:18.040" style="s2">Two of my patients however stayed in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:21.640" style="s2">The first was a woman about 35 years old</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:25.779" style="s2">She looked 50 she reminded me of a medieval peasant</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.450" end="00:04:31.939" style="s2">Of my conception of a medieval peasant. She was dirty clothes hair teeth</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:35.509" style="s2">dirty with the kind of Filth that takes months to develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">She was unbearably shy</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">She approached anyone who she thought was superior in status to her, which was virtually everyone hunched over</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:53.839" style="s2">With her eyes shaded by her hands both hands as if she could not tolerate the light emanating from her target</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.020" end="00:04:58.219" style="s2">She had been in behavioral treatment in a Montreal</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:04.580" style="s2">Hospital before as an outpatient and was in fact a sight known to the permanent staff at the clinic</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.640" end="00:05:13.279" style="s2">Others had tried to help her overcome her unfortunate manner of self presentation which made people on the streets shy away from her</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:16.159" style="s2">Made them regard her as crazy and unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:21.770" style="s2">She could learn to stand or sit up temporarily with eyes on garden</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:25.160" style="s2">But she reverted to her old habits as soon as she left the clinic</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">She may have been intellectually impaired in consequence of some biological fault</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.590" end="00:05:36.979" style="s2">It was difficult to tell because her environment was so appalling. It may have caused her ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">She was illiterate as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.500" end="00:05:48.020" style="s2">She lived with her mother whose character. I knew nothing about and with an elderly desperately ill bedridden aunt</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:51.559" style="s2">Her boyfriend was a violent alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">schizophrenic who mistreated her</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.420" end="00:06:01.369" style="s2">Psychologically and physically who was always muddling her simple mind with tirades about the devil and the worship of Satan</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.760" end="00:06:09.679" style="s2">She had nothing going for her. No beauty. No intelligence. No loving family. No skills</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.380" end="00:06:12.380" style="s2">No employment</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.080" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">Nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">She didn&#39;t come to therapy to resolve her problems</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:23.629" style="s2">However, nor to unburden her soul nor to describe her mistreatment and victimization at the hands of others</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:26.540" style="s2">she came she</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:31.160" style="s2">Came because she wanted to do something for someone who was worse off than her</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.310" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">Of the clinic where I was interning was associated with a large</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.460" end="00:06:43.190" style="s2">psychiatric hospital all of the patients that still remained after the shift to community CAIR in the aftermath of the 60s were so</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.650" end="00:06:46.250" style="s2">incapacitated that they could not survive on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:52.070" style="s2">she had done some volunteer work of some limited type in that hospital and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:58.579" style="s2">Decided if she could maybe befriend a patient take him or her outside for a walk. I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:05.000" style="s2">Think she got this idea because she had a dog which he walked regularly and what she liked to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.580" end="00:07:11.990" style="s2">All she wanted from me was help arranging this helped finding someone who she could take outside</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:17.720" style="s2">Help finding someone in the hospital bureaucracy who would allow this to happen. I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.420" end="00:07:23.119" style="s2">Was not very successful in aiding her, but she didn&#39;t seem to hold that against me</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:31.279" style="s2">it is said that one piece of evidence that runs contrary to a theory is sufficient to disprove that theory of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.770" end="00:07:36.350" style="s2">Course people do not think this way and perhaps should not in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.840" end="00:07:40.519" style="s2">General a theory is too useful to give up easily</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.890" end="00:07:48.050" style="s2">Too difficult to regenerate and the evidence against should be consistent and believable before it is accepted</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:52.009" style="s2">but the existence of this woman made me think she</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.220" end="00:07:59.989" style="s2">Was destined for a psychopathological end from the viewpoint of biological and environmental determinism</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.870" end="00:08:03.350" style="s2">fated as surely as anyone I had ever met</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.350" end="00:08:08.659" style="s2">And maybe she beat her dog sometimes and was rude to her sick aunt</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.240" end="00:08:14.810" style="s2">Maybe I never saw her vindictive or unpleasant even when her simple wishes were thwarted</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.000" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to say that she was a saint because I didn&#39;t know her well enough to tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.430" end="00:08:26.930" style="s2">But the fact was that in her misery and simplicity, she remained without self pity and able to see outside of herself</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:30.500" style="s2">Why wasn&#39;t she a criminal cruel?</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.230" end="00:08:33.230" style="s2">unbalanced and miserable</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.420" end="00:08:35.340" style="s2">She had every reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.340" end="00:08:40.850" style="s2">And yet she wasn&#39;t in her simple way. She had made the proper choices</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.400" end="00:08:48.590" style="s2">She remained bloody but unbowed and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly to be a symbol of suffering humanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.350" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">sorely afflicted</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:53.210" style="s2">Yet capable of cur and love</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.140" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">God justifies his creation in Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">Such I created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who failed</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:13.400" style="s2">Not free what proof? Could they have given sincere of true allegiance?</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.830" end="00:09:19.249" style="s2">constant faith or love where only what they needs must do appeared not what they would</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.860" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">What praise could they receive what pleasure I from such obedience?</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:28.339" style="s2">Paid when will and reason reason also his choice?</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:36.199" style="s2">Useless and vain of freedom both de spoiled made passive both had served necessity not me</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.350" end="00:09:41.480" style="s2">They therefore as to right belonged</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.270" end="00:09:49.970" style="s2">so were created nor can justly accuse their maker or their making or their fate as if</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.310" end="00:09:56.299" style="s2">Predestination overruled their will disposed by absolute decree or high foreknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:00.799" style="s2">they themselves decreed their own revolt not I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.320" end="00:10:08.929" style="s2">If I for new foreknowledge have no influence on their fault, which had no less proved certain unfair known</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.750" end="00:10:17.210" style="s2">So without least impulse or shadow of fate or ought by me immutably foreseen they trespass</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.790" end="00:10:19.939" style="s2">authors to themselves in all</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.460" end="00:10:22.460" style="s2">Both what they judge and what they choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:29.869" style="s2">For so, I formed them free and free. They must remain till they enthralled themselves. I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.570" end="00:10:34.309" style="s2">Else must change their nature and revoke the high decree</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.070" end="00:10:36.630" style="s2">unchangeable eternal</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.630" end="00:10:39.799" style="s2">Which ordained their freedom they themselves?</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.860" end="00:10:42.860" style="s2">ordained their fall</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.130" end="00:10:50.299" style="s2">The other patient I wish to describe was the schizophrenic in a small inpatient ward at a different Hospital</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.730" end="00:10:53.090" style="s2">He was about 29 when I met him a few</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.460" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">Years older than I was at the time and had been in and out of confinement for seven years</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.790" end="00:11:05.869" style="s2">He was of course on antipsychotic medication and participated in occupational therapy Act</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.170" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">He&#39;s on the ward making coasters and pencil holders and so on but he could not maintain</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:15.499" style="s2">Attention for any amount of time. It was not even much good at crafts</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.440" end="00:11:20.690" style="s2">My supervisor asked me to administer an intelligence test to him</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.690" end="00:11:27.710" style="s2">The standard ways are more for the sake of my experience than for any possible diagnostic. Good. I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.440" end="00:11:33.650" style="s2">Gave my patients some of the red and white blocks that made up the block design sub tests</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">He was supposed to arrange the blocks so they matched a pattern printed on some cards</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:46.759" style="s2">He picked them up and started to rearrange them on the desk in front of him while I timed him stupidly with a stopwatch</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">The task was impossible for him. Even at the simplest of stages. He looked</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">Constantly distracted and frustrated. I</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.270" end="00:11:59.270" style="s2">Asked what&#39;s wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.150" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">He said the battle between good and evil in heaven is going on in my head. I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.620" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">Stopped the testing at that point. I didn&#39;t know exactly what to make of his comment</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.150" end="00:12:15.709" style="s2">He was obviously suffering and the testing seemed to make it worse</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.470" end="00:12:18.470" style="s2">What was he experiencing?</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.020" end="00:12:25.400" style="s2">He wasn&#39;t lying. That&#39;s for sure in the face of such a statement. It seemed ridiculous to continue. I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.400" end="00:12:28.489" style="s2">spent some time with him that summer I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:34.069" style="s2">never met someone who was so blatantly mentally ill we talked on the ward and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.350" end="00:12:37.699" style="s2">Occasionally I would take him for a walk through the hospital grounds outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.370" end="00:12:45.799" style="s2">He was the third son of first generation immigrants his firstborn brother was a lawyer the other a physician</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:49.220" style="s2">His parents were obviously ambitious for their children</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.740" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">hard-working and disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">He had been a graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.090" end="00:12:56.090" style="s2">working towards a degree in</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.610" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">Immunology, I don&#39;t precisely remember his brothers had sent him a daunting example, and he felt pressured to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.830" end="00:13:12.590" style="s2">His experimental work had not turned out as he had expected. However, and he apparently came to believe that he might not graduate</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:15.230" style="s2">not at least when he had hoped to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">He faked his experimental results and wrote up his thesis anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.060" end="00:13:29.469" style="s2">He told me that the night he finished writing he woke up and saw the devil standing over him at the foot of his bed</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.500" end="00:13:35.229" style="s2">This event triggered the onset of his mental illness from which he had never recovered</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.470" end="00:13:42.610" style="s2">It might be said that the satanic apparition merely accompanied the expression of some pathological</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.010" end="00:13:46.689" style="s2">stress induced neural development whose appearance was</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.270" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">biologically predetermined or that the devil was merely</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.230" end="00:13:58.750" style="s2">Personification of his cultures conception of moral evil manifesting itself in imagination as a consequence of his guilt</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.900" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">Both of these levels of description have their merits</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.070" end="00:14:11.289" style="s2">But the fact remains that he saw the devil and at the vision accompanied or even was the event that destroyed him</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:18.219" style="s2">He was afraid to tell me much of his fantasy and it was only after I had paid careful attention to him that he opened</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.220" end="00:14:19.010" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.010" end="00:14:20.450" style="s2">He was not</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.450" end="00:14:24.729" style="s2">Bragging or trying to impress me. He was terrified about what he believed</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.340" end="00:14:29.769" style="s2">Terrified as a consequence of the fantasies that impressed themselves upon him</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.260" end="00:14:34.869" style="s2">he told me that he could not leave the hospital because someone was waiting to shoot him a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:37.540" style="s2">typical paranoid delusion</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.910" end="00:14:39.910" style="s2">Why did someone want to kill him?</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.030" end="00:14:44.050" style="s2">Well, he was hospitalized during the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.750" end="00:14:50.109" style="s2">Not at its height perhaps but still during a time when the threat of purposeful nuclear annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.690" end="00:14:54.039" style="s2">Seemed more plausible more likely than it does now</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.250" end="00:14:59.979" style="s2">many of the people I knew used the existence of this threat to justify to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.260" end="00:15:04.960" style="s2">Themselves their failure to participate fully in life a life</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.030" end="00:15:10.120" style="s2">Which they thought of romantically as doomed and therefore as pointless</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.340" end="00:15:13.000" style="s2">but there was some real terror in the pose and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.220" end="00:15:19.089" style="s2">The thought of the countless missiles pointed here and there around the world sapped the energy and faith of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.670" end="00:15:21.650" style="s2">hypocritical or not</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.650" end="00:15:28.810" style="s2">My schizophrenic patient believed that he was in fact the incarnation of the world annihilating force</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:37.419" style="s2">That he was destined is released from the hospital to make his way south to a nuclear missile silo on American territory</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:42.010" style="s2">That he was fated to make the decision that would launch the final war</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.100" end="00:15:48.459" style="s2">The people outside the hospital knew this and that is why they were waiting to shoot him</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.010" end="00:15:52.390" style="s2">He did not want to tell me this story in consequence</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.640" end="00:15:57.099" style="s2">Although he did because he thought that I might then want to kill him too</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.339" end="00:16:03.489" style="s2">My friends in graduate school thought of ironic that I had contact with a patient of this type</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.620" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">My peculiar interest in young and Young&#39;s ideas regarding the collective unconscious were well known to them and it seemed absurdly</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.540" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">Fitting that I would end up talking to someone with delusions of this title</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.339" end="00:16:18.939" style="s2">But I didn&#39;t know what to do with his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.640" end="00:16:23.770" style="s2">Of course, they were crazy and they had done in my patient</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.870" end="00:16:28.779" style="s2">But it still seemed to me that they were true from the metaphorical viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.990" end="00:16:37.659" style="s2">His story in totality linked his individual choice between good and evil with the cumulative horror then facing the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:42.579" style="s2">His story implied that because he had given in to temptation at a critical juncture</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.709" end="00:16:48.219" style="s2">He was in fact responsible for the horror of the potential of nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">But how could this be?</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:55.929" style="s2">And seemed insane to me to even consider that the act of one powerless</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.060" end="00:17:00.700" style="s2">Individual could be linked in some manner to the outcome of history as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">But I have no longer so sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.150" end="00:17:12.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve read much about evil and its manner of perpetration and growth and I&#39;m no longer convinced that each of us are so innocent</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.260" end="00:17:13.699" style="s2">so harmless</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.699" end="00:17:21.549" style="s2">It is of course a logical to presume that one person one speck of dust among six billion motes is any sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.040" end="00:17:24.159" style="s2">responsible for the horrible course of human events</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.250" end="00:17:31.569" style="s2">But that course in itself is not logical far from it and it seems likely that it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.850" end="00:17:34.209" style="s2">processes that we do not understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.840" end="00:17:38.980" style="s2">The most powerful arguments for the non-existence of God</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.230" end="00:17:46.939" style="s2">At least a good God are predicated on the idea that such a being would not allow for the resistance of evil in its classical</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.220" end="00:17:48.269" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.269" end="00:17:51.469" style="s2">diseases disasters or moral war</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.049" end="00:17:54.049" style="s2">pogroms forms</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.659" end="00:18:02.209" style="s2">Such arguments can be taken further even than atheism can be used to dispute the justice of the existent world itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.779" end="00:18:10.669" style="s2">Dostoyevsky states, perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a single innocent child&#39;s suffering</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.029" end="00:18:15.979" style="s2">How can the universe be constructed such that pain is permitted</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.220" end="00:18:20.839" style="s2">How can a good God allow for the existence of a suffering world?</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.620" end="00:18:28.279" style="s2">These difficult questions can be addressed in part as a consequence of careful analysis of evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.669" end="00:18:33.859" style="s2">First it seems reasonable to insist upon the value of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.980" end="00:18:36.750" style="s2">moral distinction</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.750" end="00:18:41.659" style="s2">the tragic circumstances of life should not be placed in the same category as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.509" end="00:18:44.509" style="s2">willfully undertaken harm</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.809" end="00:18:49.128" style="s2">Tragedy subjugation to the mortal conditions of existence</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.799" end="00:18:57.709" style="s2">Has an ennobling aspect at least in potential and has been constantly exploited to that end in great literature and mythology</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.429" end="00:19:02.538" style="s2">True evil by contrast is anything but noble?</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.009" end="00:19:10.909" style="s2">Participation it Out&#39;s whose sole purpose is expansion of innocent pain and suffering destroys character</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:15.889" style="s2">Forthright encounter with tragedy by contrast may increase it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.500" end="00:19:19.759" style="s2">This is the meaning of the christian myth of the crucifixion</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.769" end="00:19:24.499" style="s2">It is christ&#39;s full participation in and freely chosen</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.779" end="00:19:31.729" style="s2">Acceptance of his fate which he shares with all mankind that enables him to manifest his full identity with god</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.059" end="00:19:37.158" style="s2">And it is that identity which enables him to bear that fate and which strips it of evil</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.580" end="00:19:45.769" style="s2">Conversely it is the voluntary demeaning of our own characters, which makes the necessary tragic conditions of existence</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.679" end="00:19:48.679" style="s2">appear evil</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.289" end="00:19:55.849" style="s2">But why is life tragic why are we subject to unbearable limitation to pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.610" end="00:20:00.540" style="s2">Zees and death to cruelty at the hands of nature and society</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.299" end="00:20:03.899" style="s2">Why do terrible things happen to everyone?</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:06.790" style="s2">These are of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.790" end="00:20:12.359" style="s2">Unanswerable questions, but they must be answered somehow if we are able to face our own lives</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.720" end="00:20:18.150" style="s2">The best I can make of it is this this has helped me</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.660" end="00:20:21.660" style="s2">Nothing can exist without</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:29.099" style="s2">preconditions even a game cannot be played without rules and the rules say what cannot be done as much as what can</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.309" end="00:20:36.539" style="s2">Perhaps the world is not possible as a world without its borders without its rules</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.750" end="00:20:42.809" style="s2">Maybe existence wouldn&#39;t be possible in the absence of our painful limitations</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.470" end="00:20:50.549" style="s2">Think of it this way if we could have everything we wanted merely for wishing it if every tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.770" end="00:20:57.359" style="s2">Performed every job if all men were omniscient and immortal that everything would be the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.179" end="00:21:02.189" style="s2">All-powerful thing God and creation would never exist</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.370" end="00:21:11.099" style="s2">That is the differences between things which is a function of their specific limitations that allows them to exist at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">But the fact that things do exist does not mean that they should exist even if we are willing to grant them their necessary</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.919" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">limitations</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">Should the world exist?</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.540" end="00:21:31.199" style="s2">are the preconditions of experience so terrible that the whole game should be called off and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.900" end="00:21:36.509" style="s2">There is never any shortage of people working diligently towards this end</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.660" end="00:21:41.309" style="s2">It seems to me that we answer this question implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.309" end="00:21:45.839" style="s2">But profoundly when we lose someone we loved and then grieve</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.419" end="00:21:48.749" style="s2">This is a very common experience. I</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:52.679" style="s2">Don&#39;t think we cried because they existed either</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.470" end="00:21:55.470" style="s2">But because they are lost</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.110" end="00:22:01.229" style="s2">This presupposes a judgment rendered at a very fundamental level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.900" end="00:22:03.220" style="s2">grief</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.220" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">presupposes having loved</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.620" end="00:22:08.010" style="s2">presupposes the judgment that this person&#39;s specific</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.679" end="00:22:16.199" style="s2">Bounded exists was valuable was something that should have been even in its inevitably imperfect and vulnerable form</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.080" end="00:22:23.069" style="s2">But still the question lingers why should things even love things exist at all?</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.369" end="00:22:27.179" style="s2">If they&#39;re necessary limitations cause such suffering</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.109" end="00:22:33.809" style="s2">Perhaps we could reserve answer to the question of God&#39;s nature his</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.419" end="00:22:39.898" style="s2">Responsibility for the presence of the evil in creation until we have solved the problem of our own</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.749" end="00:22:45.899" style="s2">perhaps we could tolerate the horrors of the world if we left our own characters intact and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:48.279" style="s2">Developed them to the fullest</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.279" end="00:22:51.659" style="s2">If we took full advantage of every gift we had been granted</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:57.809" style="s2">Perhaps the world would not look horrible then</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.309" end="00:23:02.309" style="s2">That was from pages</p>
