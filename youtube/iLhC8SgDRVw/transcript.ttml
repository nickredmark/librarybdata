<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:32.970" style="s2">are equally valid but distinct each has</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:02.610" style="s2">jordan peterson and sam harris had these</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.720" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">major debates some probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.610" end="00:01:08.399" style="s2">high-profile debates between atheism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">religious belief and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.399" end="00:01:13.499" style="s2">said they were really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:15.179" style="s2">conversations but on in some sense it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.499" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">sounded like they were talking past each</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.179" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">other and i know you have this concept</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">of different forms of truth and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:24.749" style="s2">different quadrants of truth could you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">briefly explain do you think that helps</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.749" end="00:01:31.139" style="s2">to explain what was going on yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">so how sure we talked about the good to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.139" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">true in the beautiful we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:36.899" style="s2">manual counts three critiques we talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">about your you&#39;re gonna orbit masters as</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.899" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">three validity claims and said that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:49.889" style="s2">those three are a a condensed version of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">four quadrants and what they really</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.889" end="00:01:56.090" style="s2">amount to is that the four quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:02:00.929" style="s2">means that you can look at any happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.090" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">from in at least two major ways you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.929" end="00:02:07.289" style="s2">look at it from the inside or from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">outside from a subjective view or from</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.289" end="00:02:14.260" style="s2">an objective view and you can look at it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">as an individual a singular event</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.260" end="00:02:21.790" style="s2">or a plural event so every individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:24.909" style="s2">human for example exists in a series of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.790" end="00:02:28.390" style="s2">collectives and so if you put those</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.909" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">together you get four quadrants you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.390" end="00:02:35.290" style="s2">the inside and the outside of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:37.390" style="s2">individual and a collective and all</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.290" end="00:02:40.150" style="s2">three of those are very real</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.390" end="00:02:44.349" style="s2">perspectives that show very real</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.150" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">dimensions and those dimensions do turn</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.349" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2">out to be the foundation of those other</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:51.909" style="s2">items that I was mentioning I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.750" end="00:02:56.590" style="s2">previously mentioned first second and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.909" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">third person perspective so the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.590" end="00:03:02.470" style="s2">person perspective we defined as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">person who is speaking that&#39;s an i or we</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.470" end="00:03:11.099" style="s2">or me mine</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:14.049" style="s2">that&#39;s the interior of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.099" end="00:03:18.760" style="s2">what we call the upper left quadrant so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.049" end="00:03:21.459" style="s2">that&#39;s an eye space and it would be your</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.760" end="00:03:24.040" style="s2">in our mosses validity claim for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.459" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">of truthfulness or it would also be</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.040" end="00:03:30.160" style="s2">their beauty in the eye of the beholder</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">or any of the subjective beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.160" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">you happen to have and that are true</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:40.299" style="s2">existing truths for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">those exists together and collectives</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.299" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">and so those aren&#39;t just subjective</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">they&#39;re inter subjective and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">involve not just me being aware of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">but me also being aware of you for</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:57.849" style="s2">example so second person is defined as</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">the person being spoken to so in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.849" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">case you&#39;re a second person I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:05.949" style="s2">so I&#39;m first person and the goal of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.859" style="s2">dialogue in some sort of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.949" end="00:04:12.040" style="s2">discussion where your subjective space</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.859" end="00:04:14.769" style="s2">and my subjective space will resonate</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.040" end="00:04:16.659" style="s2">together closely enough that I can say I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.769" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">think I understand what you say I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.659" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">understand what you mean and you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:21.190" style="s2">look at me and say yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">understand what you mean so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.190" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">kind of mutual understanding that has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:30.009" style="s2">do not with</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">individual truthfulness or individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.009" end="00:04:36.069" style="s2">aesthetics or beauty doesn&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:41.409" style="s2">with objective truth either it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.069" end="00:04:45.729" style="s2">with inter subjective values inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.409" end="00:04:48.909" style="s2">subjective goodness ethics how we treat</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.729" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">each other as individual subjects</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.909" end="00:04:54.280" style="s2">would that be more Jordan Peterson than</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:55.389" style="s2">relative to Sam Harris yes yes they do</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.280" end="00:04:57.969" style="s2">you tend to emphasize different</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.389" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">quadrants we&#39;re Sam even though he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.969" end="00:05:04.029" style="s2">say things like consciousness is real</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:06.729" style="s2">conscious is the only thing that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.029" end="00:05:08.740" style="s2">be doubted you can look at consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.729" end="00:05:11.710" style="s2">in a kind of objective way and there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.740" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">subjective truths that kind of stuff he</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.710" end="00:05:18.120" style="s2">still has a tendency to interpret what</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.460" end="00:05:21.430" style="s2">that means from a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.120" end="00:05:25.469" style="s2">deterministic fashion so he&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.430" end="00:05:29.319" style="s2">things like using Charles Whitmore the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.469" end="00:05:35.740" style="s2">guy that got in the Texas tower and shot</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.319" end="00:05:39.099" style="s2">up a bunch of people he told his jailers</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.740" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">that when he died doing autopsy because</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.099" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">something was wrong with his brain and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">they did found a tumor and so Sam will</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:50.319" style="s2">say okay that&#39;s when we really</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">understand everything about neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.319" end="00:05:53.409" style="s2">physiology</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:57.069" style="s2">we&#39;ll understand all of evil behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.409" end="00:06:00.159" style="s2">just like this tumor is causing Whitmore</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.069" end="00:06:02.469" style="s2">to do that but just the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.159" end="00:06:08.460" style="s2">that is it&#39;s just too extremist a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.469" end="00:06:12.370" style="s2">version of it because even if the tumor</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.460" end="00:06:16.569" style="s2">can get you towards really antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.370" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">behavior it didn&#39;t say get in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.569" end="00:06:21.370" style="s2">particular tower at this particular time</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:24.039" style="s2">using this particular gun shoot exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.370" end="00:06:26.949" style="s2">these many people cause exactly these</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.039" end="00:06:29.740" style="s2">many deaths but that&#39;s the deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.949" end="00:06:33.069" style="s2">mechanism that he demands in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.740" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">interpret what&#39;s arising and again</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.069" end="00:06:40.449" style="s2">that&#39;s just you have two fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:41.289" style="s2">unprovable choices about how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.449" end="00:06:43.990" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.289" end="00:06:46.330" style="s2">relative world its ass arising and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.990" end="00:06:49.719" style="s2">either is the creative advance into</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.330" end="00:06:52.779" style="s2">novelty or there isn&#39;t and I find the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.719" end="00:06:56.369" style="s2">creative advance into novelty much much</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.779" end="00:07:00.879" style="s2">more reflective of the world as it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.369" end="00:07:04.419" style="s2">arising and in terms of any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.879" end="00:07:07.779" style="s2">ultimate truth that&#39;s where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.419" end="00:07:10.689" style="s2">waking up the traditions simply come</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.779" end="00:07:14.050" style="s2">down and say actually you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.689" end="00:07:16.869" style="s2">anything about the relative world in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:19.209" style="s2">an ultimate truth because all of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.869" end="00:07:21.399" style="s2">concepts make sense only in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.209" end="00:07:26.520" style="s2">their opposites the pleasure pain</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.399" end="00:07:29.409" style="s2">good/bad infinite finite up down in out</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.520" end="00:07:31.809" style="s2">so all of our concepts based on</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.409" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">opposites but ultimate reality has no</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.809" end="00:07:38.020" style="s2">opposite so we really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:41.459" style="s2">conceptualize it and the real genius of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.020" end="00:07:44.050" style="s2">mahayana buddhism guy named the gardener</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.459" end="00:07:48.039" style="s2">basically came out and his whole notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.050" end="00:07:50.469" style="s2">of emptiness is that you can&#39;t literally</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.039" end="00:07:53.769" style="s2">say anything about the relative world</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.990" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong because you&#39;re just not in</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.420" end="00:09:16.910" style="s2">ultimately not right and you keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.390" end="00:09:19.940" style="s2">that until you awaken the second mode of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.910" end="00:09:22.250" style="s2">knowing that plugs you in to this direct</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.510" end="00:09:33.650" style="s2">really is a mystery and that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.840" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">guards are called it emptiness easy it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.650" end="00:09:38.990" style="s2">can need to be called void nor not void</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.740" end="00:09:41.900" style="s2">but in order to point it out we call it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.990" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">the void and the whole point of that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.900" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">you keep doing these meditative</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:49.280" style="s2">practices until you awaken that mode of</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">described as deterministic or freewill</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:10:02.780" style="s2">causal or free and that&#39;s the ultimate</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:06.950" style="s2">orientation so we&#39;ll be getting those</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.790" end="00:10:09.770" style="s2">kinds of arguments that&#39;s at least one</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.950" end="00:10:12.740" style="s2">thing worth keeping in mind you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.770" end="00:10:15.080" style="s2">still give your relative arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.740" end="00:10:18.920" style="s2">which seems to work best in the relative</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.080" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">realm and that&#39;s why I say that a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.920" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">creative advance into novelty turns out</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">to be probably the best way to describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:30.470" style="s2">that and so even somebody like Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">Dennett who is often argued with sam</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.470" end="00:10:38.030" style="s2">Harris Gannett maintains that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">does produce a degree of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.030" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">degrees of freedom or what he&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">Evatt ability as opposed the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">inevitability which is determinism and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">evolution produces degrees of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:56.660" style="s2">and those are very real and even Sam</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:59.270" style="s2">will say I&#39;m not even sure I can explain</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.660" end="00:11:01.430" style="s2">the difference between me and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.270" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">because he realizes if you actually push</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.430" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">that deterministic position it really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:08.360" style="s2">gets into into problems and doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:15.030" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.360" end="00:11:19.430" style="s2">the whole notion of some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.030" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">freedom that in itself is very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.430" end="00:11:26.520" style="s2">describe adequately because as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:28.920" style="s2">you say what that free choice is you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.520" end="00:11:31.530" style="s2">always come up or some something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.920" end="00:11:34.350" style="s2">preceded it and it was outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.530" end="00:11:38.100" style="s2">control and so you never really looked</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.350" end="00:11:40.650" style="s2">like you have freedom but again you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.100" end="00:11:43.170" style="s2">do the same thing to that opposite</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.650" end="00:11:45.450" style="s2">belief because you&#39;re both just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.170" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">arguing opposites in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.450" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">ultimately is is beyond opposites but</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:54.510" style="s2">Mike Murphy quotes an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:59.430" style="s2">biologist who went back to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.510" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">evolutionary record and attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.430" end="00:12:04.940" style="s2">determine the number of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:07.380" style="s2">transformations that occurred in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.940" end="00:12:10.400" style="s2">evolutionary unfolding and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.380" end="00:12:14.270" style="s2">transformation is defined as as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.400" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">introduction of an emergent quality and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.270" end="00:12:21.390" style="s2">emergent means new means it never</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2">happened before means that nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.390" end="00:12:26.640" style="s2">it happened before it&#39;s radically novel</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the creative advancing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.640" end="00:12:32.010" style="s2">into novelty course they&#39;re interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.070" style="s2">is that I don&#39;t know how this person</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.010" end="00:12:38.760" style="s2">came up with this but the number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.070" end="00:12:42.710" style="s2">minor transformations in evolution were</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.760" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">six hundred thousand the number of major</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.710" end="00:12:47.070" style="s2">transformations and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:49.160" style="s2">the distinction was between that but</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.070" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">that was between twenty and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.160" end="00:12:55.110" style="s2">but the point is there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">newness emerging in this evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:12:59.400" style="s2">stream and that&#39;s how we went from just</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:02.640" style="s2">simple quarks to the sauna so</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.400" end="00:13:05.250" style="s2">Shakespeare the undeniable fact of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.640" end="00:13:07.470" style="s2">is it novelty it&#39;s just all over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.250" end="00:13:09.870" style="s2">bloody place and if you have strict</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.470" end="00:13:12.270" style="s2">determinism you can&#39;t get that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.870" end="00:13:14.940" style="s2">going to happen and so you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.270" end="00:13:16.950" style="s2">end up making a choice you just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.940" end="00:13:21.329" style="s2">stare at science and say well it looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.950" end="00:13:22.829" style="s2">like every event has a cause</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.329" end="00:13:25.410" style="s2">you run into the Heisenberg uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.829" end="00:13:28.319" style="s2">principle and it says no it doesn&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.410" end="00:13:30.559" style="s2">actually probabilistic so determinist</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.319" end="00:13:36.149" style="s2">determinism is strictly shot right there</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.559" end="00:13:39.420" style="s2">anyway or you acknowledge that however</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.149" end="00:13:42.119" style="s2">this happens there is a creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.420" end="00:13:43.679" style="s2">emergence of novelty and you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.119" end="00:13:46.889" style="s2">thoughts right now that in part are</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.679" end="00:13:50.369" style="s2">emergent they&#39;re a bit of newness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.889" end="00:13:53.069" style="s2">never ever ever happened before and even</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.369" end="00:13:55.379" style="s2">if we knew all of the factors in your</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.069" end="00:13:57.299" style="s2">brain and everything else is affecting</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.379" end="00:13:59.459" style="s2">you and by the way you were affected by</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.299" end="00:14:02.009" style="s2">a billion other factors all of which</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.459" end="00:14:02.779" style="s2">have to be determined in order for that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.009" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.779" end="00:14:07.079" style="s2">even if we knew all of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:09.720" style="s2">still a capacity that novelty is going</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.079" end="00:14:12.839" style="s2">to emerge in your case they only happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.720" end="00:14:15.149" style="s2">six hundred thousand times in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.839" end="00:14:18.209" style="s2">and even sam harris has at least six</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.149" end="00:14:22.679" style="s2">novel ideas before breakfast and he acts</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.209" end="00:14:24.779" style="s2">that way so that kind of argument just</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.679" end="00:14:26.850" style="s2">sort of goes back and forth and back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.779" end="00:14:30.149" style="s2">forth and you can get very bright people</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.850" end="00:14:32.429" style="s2">like Dennett arguing very similar to sam</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.149" end="00:14:34.139" style="s2">harris like sam says he really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.429" end="00:14:36.149" style="s2">tell the difference between him and done</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.139" end="00:14:40.589" style="s2">it but then it argues four degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.149" end="00:14:45.209" style="s2">freedom and sam argues for not what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.589" end="00:14:49.259" style="s2">happens with the Sam Harris and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.209" end="00:14:52.559" style="s2">Peterson is how they come down on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.259" end="00:14:57.139" style="s2">side of this ultimate mystery of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.559" end="00:14:59.999" style="s2">happening and however much Sam</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.139" end="00:15:02.669" style="s2">acknowledges that ultimate unity</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.999" end="00:15:05.759" style="s2">consciousness and its subjectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.669" end="00:15:08.629" style="s2">real and all of that he does tend to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.759" end="00:15:13.139" style="s2">come down on the side of third-person</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.629" end="00:15:17.790" style="s2">objective realism and so if we could</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.139" end="00:15:20.759" style="s2">know all of brain Neri neurophysiology</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.790" end="00:15:22.799" style="s2">at some point he specifically says then</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.759" end="00:15:27.209" style="s2">we would understand all of evil and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.799" end="00:15:30.179" style="s2">presumably be able to fix that and again</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.209" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">that&#39;s just pushing it way way way too</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.179" end="00:15:35.310" style="s2">far and that&#39;s what peterson will do he</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:36.990" style="s2">won&#39;t push it that far in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.310" end="00:15:43.140" style="s2">so he&#39;s always coming up with these</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.990" end="00:15:47.460" style="s2">factors that have a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.140" end="00:15:50.940" style="s2">truth value and we said earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.460" end="00:15:52.530" style="s2">there were a narrow version of truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.940" end="00:15:53.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t the good the true and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.530" end="00:15:55.890" style="s2">beautiful and that was just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.910" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">narrower objective truth but that all</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.890" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">three of them could be considered</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:03.000" style="s2">different types of truth in the broad</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:06.600" style="s2">sense and that&#39;s what Peterson is always</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.000" end="00:16:09.390" style="s2">acknowledging and so I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.600" end="00:16:13.950" style="s2">weinstein brothers came up in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">nursing metaphoric truth however we want</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.950" end="00:16:19.760" style="s2">to consider it there are truths that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">don&#39;t come down to just third-person</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.760" end="00:16:26.370" style="s2">objective exterior realistic truths and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:29.840" style="s2">those are very very real realities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.370" end="00:16:33.570" style="s2">if nothing else how we get to those is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.840" end="00:16:36.570" style="s2">different from how we get to a mere</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.570" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">objective understanding so how we</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.570" end="00:16:42.870" style="s2">understand that atoms make up molecules</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:45.620" style="s2">is different in terms of how we</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.870" end="00:16:52.130" style="s2">understand what you and I should be</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.620" end="00:16:55.560" style="s2">doing in both senses there&#39;s an overall</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.130" end="00:16:58.080" style="s2">type of truthfulness to whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.560" end="00:17:00.870" style="s2">saying there&#39;s an isness to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.080" end="00:17:03.570" style="s2">we&#39;re saying so even if my values arise</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.870" end="00:17:06.570" style="s2">in my awareness if I&#39;m aware of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.570" end="00:17:09.300" style="s2">they have an isness they exist they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.570" end="00:17:11.910" style="s2">phenomenologically real and so I can say</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.300" end="00:17:16.199" style="s2">well that&#39;s the isness that&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.910" end="00:17:18.060" style="s2">then in same is true for the good the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.199" end="00:17:22.260" style="s2">true the beautiful they all have an</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.060" end="00:17:24.870" style="s2">isness factor and that&#39;s what Sam the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.260" end="00:17:26.310" style="s2">focus is on because he&#39;ll just say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.870" end="00:17:28.680" style="s2">we&#39;re just navigating through this world</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.310" end="00:17:31.080" style="s2">and we just make choices and these are</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.680" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">better or worse but there are things</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">that are ultimately true and he focuses</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">on the business of that and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:43.530" style="s2">we should that&#39;s what we should go for</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.990" end="00:17:46.950" style="s2">and again that&#39;s that&#39;s fine but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.530" end="00:17:48.260" style="s2">methods that you get to those is those</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.950" end="00:17:51.110" style="s2">are still different</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.260" end="00:17:53.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s harbormaster&#39;s validity</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.110" end="00:17:57.470" style="s2">claims it is the good that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.390" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">the beautiful it is quadrants and Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.470" end="00:18:03.799" style="s2">focusing on those right-hand exterior or</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.650" end="00:18:06.860" style="s2">purses and Jordan acknowledges those but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.799" end="00:18:11.540" style="s2">he&#39;s always coming up with some very</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.860" end="00:18:13.790" style="s2">real left-hand how in terms of values</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.540" end="00:18:16.419" style="s2">and I don&#39;t necessarily agree with all</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.790" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">he says but I absolutely agree with his</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.419" end="00:18:21.799" style="s2">addressing that dimension and that issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">because that is real that is there and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.799" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">that cannot be reduced objective science</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:29.150" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting because Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:30.919" style="s2">Peterson Sam Harris had a two-hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.150" end="00:18:33.470" style="s2">conversation where they couldn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.919" end="00:18:37.160" style="s2">about the definition of truth I know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.470" end="00:18:39.650" style="s2">know can you can you explain why they</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.160" end="00:18:43.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t agree well yeah because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.650" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t there each talking from a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.040" end="00:18:48.410" style="s2">different one of these perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:51.830" style="s2">the fact is all four of those are</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.410" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">correct that&#39;s the whole point about an</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.830" end="00:18:57.890" style="s2">integral approach is that everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:58.940" style="s2">right and so again it&#39;s not who&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.890" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">and who&#39;s wrong it&#39;s how they all fit</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.940" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">together and these were two relatively</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:09.650" style="s2">good arguments being given for some very</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:13.160" style="s2">different truth perspectives and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.650" end="00:19:14.870" style="s2">were both right and that&#39;s why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.160" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of begrudging</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.870" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">agreement they&#39;ll both see the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:21.260" style="s2">person&#39;s argue and go well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">really disagree with that but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.260" end="00:19:25.370" style="s2">part that&#39;s not being included and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">they&#39;ll talk about their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.370" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">truths and how it is different from this</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">one and so they&#39;re saying something</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">that&#39;s not getting included in the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:36.200" style="s2">person&#39;s argument and they&#39;ll go okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.660" style="s2">but then often the other side will say</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.200" end="00:19:40.340" style="s2">well I don&#39;t disagree with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.660" end="00:19:42.650" style="s2">just here&#39;s this other stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.340" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">not including and this aren&#39;t went back</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.650" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">and forth in back and forth and you see</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">in a sense the same thing with Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">Dennett and Sam Harris and their</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">argument on free will they agree on</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:59.059" style="s2">almost everything in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">about neurophysiology but one of them is</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:30.809" style="s2">is free agency which is what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:33.789" style="s2">peterson and Denon tend to argue is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.809" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">thieves can&#39;t Spurgeon even right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.789" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">even if we don&#39;t know all of</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:43.720" style="s2">or not we do know if we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.649" end="00:23:46.330" style="s2">conformist or for acting more on our own</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.720" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">wishes and desires we can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.330" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">right now we know if we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:53.799" style="s2">right now or not and if we do become</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:56.529" style="s2">more autonomous then we are freer from</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.799" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">the constraints and demands of a herd</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.529" end="00:24:02.200" style="s2">mentality and a hetero no --mess</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:05.110" style="s2">existence which is not a very creative</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.200" end="00:24:07.659" style="s2">autonomous individual existence and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.110" end="00:24:10.779" style="s2">can do that whether or not there&#39;s brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.659" end="00:24:12.460" style="s2">determinism or not I mean maybe my brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.779" end="00:24:15.159" style="s2">is totally determined right now I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.460" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">still make that choice and the one is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.159" end="00:24:22.659" style="s2">free and the other isn&#39;t free so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:25.000" style="s2">the type of free will arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.659" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">most believers in free will argue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.000" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">not what Sam tends to argue he tends to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:33.100" style="s2">argue this hard determinism</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.320" end="00:24:35.290" style="s2">then with a maximal autonomy not very</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.100" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">many people do that during Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.290" end="00:24:43.090" style="s2">not doing that and Daniel Dennett&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:46.410" style="s2">doing that so what Sam is tending to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.090" end="00:24:50.950" style="s2">is fall back on these right-hand</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.410" end="00:24:54.130" style="s2">exterior third-person perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.950" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">do tend to look more deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.130" end="00:25:02.370" style="s2">strictly deterministic what&#39;s Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:05.730" style="s2">is doing is arguing from these interior</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.370" end="00:25:09.400" style="s2">subjective and inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.730" end="00:25:12.040" style="s2">dimensions that are also very real and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.400" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">cannot be determined according to merely</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.040" end="00:25:18.940" style="s2">objective exterior realism categories</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:21.790" style="s2">and so they really are in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.940" end="00:25:23.470" style="s2">even though they do find that if they</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.790" end="00:25:26.290" style="s2">kind of push into each other that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.470" end="00:25:28.800" style="s2">there&#39;s some real sort of core</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.290" end="00:25:32.220" style="s2">agreements they really are</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.800" end="00:25:34.420" style="s2">differentiating in large measure</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.220" end="00:25:36.460" style="s2">according to these different quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.420" end="00:25:38.920" style="s2">these different perspectives that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.460" end="00:25:41.320" style="s2">are taking as most fundamentally real</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.920" end="00:25:43.030" style="s2">they acknowledge the others but they</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:46.410" style="s2">tend to to really come back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.030" end="00:25:48.840" style="s2">emphasize those particular perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.410" end="00:25:51.640" style="s2">especially when the other person isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.840" end="00:25:54.160" style="s2">including them and that tends to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.640" end="00:25:56.620" style="s2">way the argument goes is Sam will argue</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.160" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">that that&#39;s just not right and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.620" end="00:25:59.710" style="s2">Jordan will say well that&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:02.170" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.710" end="00:26:04.030" style="s2">and so they get into that kind of lockup</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.170" end="00:26:06.180" style="s2">now even though they both sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.030" end="00:26:08.740" style="s2">acknowledge the existence of all of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.180" end="00:26:10.540" style="s2">but one of the real fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.740" end="00:26:12.550" style="s2">differences is just that they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.540" end="00:26:15.610" style="s2">from these different perspectives those</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.550" end="00:26:18.180" style="s2">different perspectives are real and each</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.610" end="00:26:21.580" style="s2">different perspective shows a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.180" end="00:26:24.460" style="s2">dimension of reality it really exists</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.580" end="00:26:27.670" style="s2">it&#39;s really there and you can&#39;t argue it</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.460" end="00:26:33.310" style="s2">away and that&#39;s why they don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.670" end="00:26:35.770" style="s2">really give up on the argument I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.310" end="00:26:39.180" style="s2">this is really just totally obvious it</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.770" end="00:26:42.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a perennial unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.180" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">philosophical question in the West like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.100" end="00:26:45.850" style="s2">the mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:47.860" style="s2">problem primary quality and the primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.850" end="00:26:51.010" style="s2">problem in all those those are really</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.860" end="00:26:54.279" style="s2">fundamental issues in part because it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.010" end="00:26:57.370" style="s2">does come down to that mystical notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.279" end="00:27:00.039" style="s2">that ultimately all of these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.370" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">are based on opposites and ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.039" end="00:27:04.179" style="s2">reality isn&#39;t an opposite so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.200" end="00:27:05.799" style="s2">always going to get caught up in these</p>
