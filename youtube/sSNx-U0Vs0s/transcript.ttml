<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:42.539" style="s2">university video so I went to Costa Rica</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.560" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">when I was 20 thinking in whatever way I</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.539" end="00:04:45.389" style="s2">was going to save them but I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">volunteer my time we were gonna build</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.389" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">hospitals at schools and is that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">gonna be amazing we had two different</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">placements with but we were at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.819" end="00:05:00.139" style="s2">group of people Wow</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">there was Australians that came</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.139" end="00:05:05.849" style="s2">Canadians that came and then a handful</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">of the local Costa Ricans Tico&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.849" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">Antigua&#39;s and when we got there we got</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">to choose which project we were on like</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">we got to say which one we wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:17.430" style="s2">on and our group ended up being all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">people who said put me wherever you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:22.169" style="s2">me because it was probably the least</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:25.289" style="s2">attractive of the groups of the projects</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.169" end="00:05:26.699" style="s2">but we got the best people on it for</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.289" end="00:05:28.439" style="s2">that very reason it was like the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.699" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">were like wherever fate wants me is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.439" end="00:05:33.690" style="s2">where I will go we went to this small</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">town that was brand new and we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.690" end="00:05:38.190" style="s2">trying to build a school we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:41.129" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t have the equipment like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.190" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t arrived yet so we basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.129" end="00:05:44.430" style="s2">kind of did all of these odd jobs around</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:46.199" style="s2">this town at one point we were picking</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.430" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">up litter Lord laughing at us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.199" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">throwing litter at us and like this town</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t connected because they were new</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">and yet at the same time there was this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:57.449" style="s2">private waterfall and we did finally</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:05:59.159" style="s2">start building a school this in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.449" end="00:06:02.009" style="s2">community came together and started</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.159" end="00:06:05.279" style="s2">started helping with that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.009" end="00:06:07.589" style="s2">traveled like four hours away it took us</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.279" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">an entire day to get there to this small</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.589" end="00:06:14.969" style="s2">town where people had more of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:18.440" style="s2">community they&#39;d spent generations there</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.969" end="00:06:18.440" style="s2">but the teenagers went away to school</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.949" end="00:06:25.219" style="s2">the difference between just those two</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.779" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">placements with was huge but learning</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.219" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">how connected these people are and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">much they have to give each other was</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:36.089" style="s2">meant when I got back from Costa Rica I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:38.550" style="s2">went through extreme reverse culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.089" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">shock I couldn&#39;t handle Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.550" end="00:06:43.979" style="s2">sure it&#39;s like we&#39;re too busy it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">chaotic we don&#39;t understand what what</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.979" end="00:06:48.930" style="s2">like true beauty and community and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:51.629" style="s2">connection is and so although I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.930" end="00:06:53.509" style="s2">planning on going to university one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.629" end="00:06:56.759" style="s2">the people I&#39;d went to Costa Rica with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.509" end="00:06:58.650" style="s2">was had applied for med school but had</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.759" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">not gotten in for several years so she</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.650" end="00:07:02.190" style="s2">was going to go to Australia and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:03.210" style="s2">was like yes that&#39;s what I want to do I</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.190" end="00:07:04.889" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna go to university I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.210" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">go with you to Australia what we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.889" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">visit the people we had also into Costa</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">Rica with and she ended up getting into</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.530" end="00:07:14.120" style="s2">med school so she didn&#39;t go and I went</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">by myself to Australia</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.120" end="00:07:18.930" style="s2">finally I went to a place where I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">speak the language but it was funny</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.930" end="00:07:23.699" style="s2">because it was finally I was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">a cultural exchange and yet what I found</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.699" end="00:07:30.780" style="s2">was like Canada culture but the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:35.789" style="s2">like we&#39;re really cold they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.780" end="00:07:38.789" style="s2">hot we&#39;re both colonial well colonial</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.789" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">countries they like pushed out and have</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.789" end="00:07:41.159" style="s2">horrible history with the Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.770" style="s2">people we have horrible history the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.159" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">First Nations people like I live by</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.770" end="00:07:47.400" style="s2">Whistler where a lot of Australians</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.449" style="s2">common ski and I was like hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.400" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">and Bondi Beach and the places a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.449" end="00:07:57.900" style="s2">further so sorry North South would be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">little warmer new runs the beaches were</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.900" end="00:08:02.190" style="s2">right hang out for a few weeks and so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:04.710" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really in party mode but I was on</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.190" end="00:08:06.060" style="s2">this like party bus and spending a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.710" end="00:08:07.409" style="s2">of time I myself but I&#39;d kind of go in</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.060" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">and out of like I&#39;d stay with one group</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.409" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">for a while and then continue on and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">was really hate like it was it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.219" style="s2">make sense for me to go to Australia</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">like I said I was finally looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.219" end="00:08:22.469" style="s2">cultural experience and everyone spoke</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:23.969" style="s2">English and it was again I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.469" end="00:08:25.770" style="s2">change it for the world and glad I went</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.969" end="00:08:29.130" style="s2">there at that time well I was there I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.770" end="00:08:33.209" style="s2">applied to university back home and got</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.130" end="00:08:38.219" style="s2">in and it was travelling by myself but</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.209" end="00:08:40.020" style="s2">speaking the language and all three of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.219" end="00:08:43.349" style="s2">those experiences I mean I love</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.020" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">travelling but I don&#39;t do small</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.349" end="00:08:46.529" style="s2">traveling I went to Germany for three</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:48.089" style="s2">months and came back on speaking German</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.529" end="00:08:49.529" style="s2">I went to Costa Rica for three months</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.089" end="00:08:51.180" style="s2">and came back no speaking Spanish and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.529" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">tried hard to learn Spanish and Spanish</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.270" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">went to Australia and I wasn&#39;t there a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:02.220" style="s2">new language but I just followed animals</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">around I&#39;m just like okay gurus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.220" end="00:09:05.880" style="s2">what I was there to do I went to hang</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">out near the river for a day all by</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.880" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">myself to and stayed in a small</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:11.820" style="s2">town to find platypi</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.780" end="00:09:23.670" style="s2">Germany when I was 16 I turned 20 in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">Costa Rica and I turned 21 in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.670" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t really been traveling</p>
