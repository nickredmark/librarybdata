<p begin="00:00:38.880" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">thinking about things that I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">about and what I&#39;m most happy about so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">far is that I haven&#39;t spilled my my</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:49.410" style="s2">bubbly water into my computer so far</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.120" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">while I&#39;ve been doing these lectures</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.410" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s always I&#39;ll probably do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:55.589" style="s2">tonight now that I&#39;m bragging about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:58.199" style="s2">having avoided it so thank you all for</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.589" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">coming this is the last lecture in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.199" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">12 part series I did mention that I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">made arrangements with the theatre at</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">least to do this once a month for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">next four months and we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">play it by ear past end I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">continue and I&#39;ll find another venue and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">perhaps to do it every two weeks but</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">certainly once a month and maybe I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">even get deeper into the material if</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s only once a month so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">then and then we&#39;ll really slow down to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:24.690" style="s2">a snail&#39;s crawl yeah so this is a tough</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">one tonight you know it&#39;s something a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.690" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">story that everyone with any sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">should approach with a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">degree of trepidation I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">on my book this week on Chapter 7 which</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">is called do what is meaningful not</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:41.190" style="s2">what&#39;s expedient and it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">been a very difficult chapter because</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.190" end="00:01:48.599" style="s2">I&#39;m coming to I&#39;m trying to to extend my</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">understanding of sacrifice which is of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.599" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">course what we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">tonight in great detail and and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">been wrestling with exactly how to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:01:59.459" style="s2">that and I&#39;m going to read you some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">that I think today don&#39;t generally read</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.459" end="00:02:03.660" style="s2">when I do my lectures but this is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:05.489" style="s2">complicated that I&#39;m not confident of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.660" end="00:02:08.119" style="s2">ability to just spin it off you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.489" end="00:02:12.630" style="s2">sort of what would you call it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.119" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">spontaneously that&#39;s the word and so and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.630" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">it&#39;ll also give me a chance to test out</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">whether what I&#39;ve written which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:19.709" style="s2">been struggling with has the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">poetic flow that I&#39;d like to have if</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.709" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">you&#39;re writing it&#39;s really good to read</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.970" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">things aloud you know because you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:27.989" style="s2">tell if you&#39;ve got the rhythmic cadence</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">right then so so anyways thank you all</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.989" end="00:02:32.550" style="s2">for coming many of you have I believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">attended all 12 lectures and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.550" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">really remarkable it&#39;s amazing that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">know this place has been full every</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">single lecture it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">unbelievable that would be the case and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">you know about more than two million</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.680" style="s2">views of this is being watched more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">two million views it&#39;s not 2 million</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:50.190" style="s2">people because it would be the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">people I would suspect many times but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.190" end="00:02:54.960" style="s2">that&#39;s also crazy but it&#39;s a crazy world</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">and it seems to keep me getting crazier</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.960" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">so hopefully this is some addition to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">stabilizing it and making it slightly</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:06.240" style="s2">more sane that&#39;s the hope anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a couple of stories to deal</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.240" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">with tonight complex complex stories not</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">really easy to comprehend in any sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:19.050" style="s2">of the in sense of the word I mean with</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:22.140" style="s2">the story of Isaac God calls on his his</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.050" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">chosen individual Abraham the person</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.140" end="00:03:26.490" style="s2">who&#39;s made this contract with to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:27.720" style="s2">sacrifice his son and it&#39;s how in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.490" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">world are you supposed to make sensible</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.720" end="00:03:31.830" style="s2">any sort of sensible sense out of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly that sort of story that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.830" end="00:03:37.020" style="s2">makes modern people who are convinced</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">that the faster we put the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.020" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">stories behind us the better it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:43.050" style="s2">grist for their mill you know because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">seems like such a incomprehensible and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.050" end="00:03:48.690" style="s2">even barbaric act on the part of God and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">so you know I hesitate to even approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">it because well because there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">ways that the an interpretation of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">sort can go wrong but we&#39;ll see how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">goes and so let&#39;s walk through it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">see what happens so we start with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:06.690" style="s2">story of Sarah and Isaac and the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:09.600" style="s2">visited Sarah as he had said you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">remember when Abraham was in the midst</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.600" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">of his appropriate sacrificial routines</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.120" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">which we&#39;ve characterized as his return</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">to the contract he made with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">the good the contract with God he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">informed by God that he would get what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">he most wanted which was an error and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">despite his advanced old age and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:30.030" style="s2">course Sarah was very skeptical about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">that as she had every reason to be but</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.030" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">this story opens with with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:37.230" style="s2">fulfillment of God&#39;s promise to Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">and the Lord visited Sarah as he had</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.230" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:45.480" style="s2">had spoken for Sarah conceived and bore</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">Abraham a son in his old age at the set</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.480" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">time of which God had spoken to him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:52.950" style="s2">Abraham called the name of his son that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:55.800" style="s2">was born unto Him whom Sarah bear to him</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.950" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.800" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">Isaac being eight days old as God</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:01.930" style="s2">commanded him had commanded him</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">and Abraham was a hundred years old when</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.930" end="00:05:08.469" style="s2">his son Isaac was born unto him and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.900" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">Sarah said goth had made God had God</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.469" end="00:05:13.779" style="s2">have made me to laugh so that all that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:15.240" style="s2">here will laugh with me and she said who</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.779" end="00:05:17.710" style="s2">would have said unto Abraham that Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.240" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">should have given children suck for I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.710" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">borne him a son in his old age and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">child grew and was weaned and Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">made a great feast the same day that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:29.590" style="s2">Isaac was weaned I suppose one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:31.479" style="s2">one of the purposes let&#39;s say perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.590" end="00:05:37.419" style="s2">the literary purposes of this story is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.479" end="00:05:41.080" style="s2">to exaggerate for dramatic purposes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.419" end="00:05:43.029" style="s2">importance of a child you know when</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.080" end="00:05:44.759" style="s2">people are young and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.029" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">particularly true in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.759" end="00:05:52.150" style="s2">they seem to often regard the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.740" end="00:05:54.039" style="s2">possibility of having a child as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.150" end="00:05:56.680" style="s2">impediment to their lifestyle you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.039" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">and of course in some ways I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.680" end="00:06:01.479" style="s2">that&#39;s true although you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:02.889" style="s2">quite a lifestyle before a child</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.479" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">actually constitutes an impediment</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.889" end="00:06:07.389" style="s2">because having a child in your life is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">actually something that&#39;s remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.389" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">almost beyond belief you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:12.789" style="s2">have a relationship with a child that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.889" style="s2">better than any relationship you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.789" end="00:06:17.009" style="s2">had with anyone in your life if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.889" end="00:06:20.710" style="s2">careful and if you&#39;re fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.009" end="00:06:23.050" style="s2">fortunate being fortunate helps you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.710" end="00:06:25.089" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen many people delay having</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.050" end="00:06:27.159" style="s2">children and for understandable reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.089" end="00:06:28.569" style="s2">it&#39;s no simple decision to have a child</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.159" end="00:06:30.039" style="s2">and of course now we can make the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.569" end="00:06:32.469" style="s2">decision to have a child which of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.039" end="00:06:34.899" style="s2">people couldn&#39;t in in past ages really</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.469" end="00:06:36.129" style="s2">but sometimes you see people delay and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.899" end="00:06:37.569" style="s2">they delay too long and then they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.129" end="00:06:39.009" style="s2">get to have a child and then they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.419" end="00:06:53.289" style="s2">see exactly how catastrophic it is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.710" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">can be how catastrophic it can be for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.289" end="00:06:58.300" style="s2">people not to have one of the not to be</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.839" end="00:07:06.279" style="s2">the things this story does by by</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.969" end="00:07:07.959" style="s2">delaying the arrival of Isaac and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.279" end="00:07:10.959" style="s2">delaying the arrival of Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.959" end="00:07:12.729" style="s2">continually is to exaggerate the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.959" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">important significance of the child</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.729" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">because it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:17.770" style="s2">until you&#39;re deprived of something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">truly not until you&#39;re deprived of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.770" end="00:07:21.400" style="s2">something that you have any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:23.290" style="s2">what its value is and Isaac was waiting</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.400" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">or Abraham was waiting a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.290" end="00:07:26.950" style="s2">a hundred years a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:28.780" style="s2">and the same with Sarah and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.950" end="00:07:31.870" style="s2">unbelievably excited and of course this</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.780" end="00:07:33.850" style="s2">also heightens the drama that&#39;s inherent</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.870" end="00:07:35.980" style="s2">in the entire sacrificial story because</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.850" end="00:07:37.300" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that eventually that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.980" end="00:07:39.550" style="s2">Abraham is called upon to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.300" end="00:07:41.760" style="s2">Isaac which would be bad enough under</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.550" end="00:07:44.380" style="s2">any other any circumstances whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.760" end="00:07:46.930" style="s2">self-evidently but the fact that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.380" end="00:07:49.660" style="s2">been waiting a century for the arrival</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.930" end="00:07:51.669" style="s2">of this child desperately and made all</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.660" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">the proper sacrifices and lived in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.669" end="00:07:57.390" style="s2">appropriate manner to allow this to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:08:05.800" style="s2">occur dramatically heightens the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.390" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">literary tension now you remember Hagar</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.800" end="00:08:12.310" style="s2">this is the next part of the story Hagar</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:14.650" style="s2">was is was Sarah&#39;s handmaid and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.310" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">Sarah was unable to bear abraham a child</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.650" end="00:08:21.330" style="s2">she sent him Hagar and Hagar immediately</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:25.750" style="s2">got pregnant and and gave birth to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.330" end="00:08:27.100" style="s2">Ishmael and the story picks up from that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">point here and if this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.100" end="00:08:30.850" style="s2">interesting I mentioned the other week</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">when I was talking to you guys a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.850" end="00:08:34.570" style="s2">of weeks in a row just how interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:36.250" style="s2">it has been to scour the internet for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:37.719" style="s2">the for the paintings that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.250" end="00:08:40.060" style="s2">associated with these stories there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.719" end="00:08:42.580" style="s2">just a there&#39;s an amazing wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.060" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">great paintings that illustrate every</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.580" end="00:08:47.830" style="s2">single bit of the of every single</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">biblical story and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.830" end="00:08:51.940" style="s2">really been enlightening to me to find</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:55.089" style="s2">out just exactly how poorly educated I</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.940" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">am you know like I I&#39;m a what would you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.089" end="00:09:01.330" style="s2">say I&#39;m I&#39;m a great admirer of artistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:03.070" style="s2">talent and of artistic endeavor but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.330" end="00:09:05.020" style="s2">there&#39;s so much I don&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.070" end="00:09:07.690" style="s2">history of art that it&#39;s just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.020" end="00:09:09.940" style="s2">beyond belief and to see this treasure</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.690" end="00:09:11.770" style="s2">trove of images that I really had no</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.940" end="00:09:13.810" style="s2">idea that existed of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.770" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">spread all over the world and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.810" end="00:09:18.280" style="s2">been in recent years that you could have</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">access to them and in this way just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.280" end="00:09:23.470" style="s2">just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">revelation of the depth to which these</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.470" end="00:09:27.529" style="s2">stories have absolutely permeated our</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:30.259" style="s2">culture and the loss that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.529" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">if we didn&#39;t know them properly and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.259" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">take them with a degree of seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:37.970" style="s2">that they deserve so anyways this is one</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:40.069" style="s2">of those great images and Sarah saw the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.970" end="00:09:44.329" style="s2">son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.069" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">born unto Abraham mocking wherefore she</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.329" end="00:09:48.290" style="s2">said unto Abraham cast out this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:49.939" style="s2">bondwoman and her son for the son of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.290" end="00:09:52.759" style="s2">this bondwoman shall not be heir with my</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.939" end="00:09:54.559" style="s2">son even with Isaac and the thing was</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.759" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2">very Grievous in Abraham&#39;s sight because</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.559" end="00:09:58.819" style="s2">of his son was being quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">tension between Abraham or between Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.819" end="00:10:02.899" style="s2">and Hagar as you could imagine there</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:04.670" style="s2">might be why wouldn&#39;t there be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.899" end="00:10:06.980" style="s2">first of all Hagar had the first child</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.670" end="00:10:09.499" style="s2">and and that elevated her status and she</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.980" end="00:10:11.209" style="s2">was Sarah&#39;s made handmaiden so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.499" end="00:10:15.499" style="s2">obviously going to be quite awkward and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.209" end="00:10:17.029" style="s2">then she she lorded it over Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.499" end="00:10:19.009" style="s2">because of the fact that she got</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.029" end="00:10:21.800" style="s2">pregnant so easily and now we see this</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.009" end="00:10:25.329" style="s2">situation where Ishmael is doing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.800" end="00:10:27.649" style="s2">same thing with regards to Isaac and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.329" end="00:10:30.050" style="s2">that causes a substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.649" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">trouble the family is a familial</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.050" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">division occurring here God said unto</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:37.399" style="s2">Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:39.589" style="s2">sight because of the lad and because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.399" end="00:10:41.420" style="s2">the bondwoman in all that Sarah hath</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.589" end="00:10:43.939" style="s2">said unto thee hearken unto her voice</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.420" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">for in Isaac shall thy seed be called</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.939" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">and but also of the son of the bondwoman</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:50.809" style="s2">will I make a nation because he is thy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:53.329" style="s2">seed that&#39;s so that&#39;s it that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.809" end="00:10:55.129" style="s2">interesting outcome to you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.329" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">pointed out before we discussed before</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.129" end="00:11:00.559" style="s2">the fact that because Abraham has made</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.470" end="00:11:02.180" style="s2">has lived his life properly and has kept</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.559" end="00:11:03.800" style="s2">the contract with God there&#39;s every</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.180" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">evidence in the story that no matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.800" end="00:11:09.290" style="s2">what the vicissitudes of Abraham&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:11.629" style="s2">you know how the Great Serpent that he</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.290" end="00:11:14.389" style="s2">sits on in some sense weaves back and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.629" end="00:11:16.459" style="s2">forth there&#39;s always the promise that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.389" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">things will work out positively and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.459" end="00:11:20.660" style="s2">know you could read that as naive</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">optimism but I think it has a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.660" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">to do with the actual power of keeping</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:28.009" style="s2">the contractual agreement because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:29.629" style="s2">really do believe and I&#39;ve spent a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.009" end="00:11:31.129" style="s2">tremendous amount of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.629" end="00:11:32.749" style="s2">this over the last couple of weeks in</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.870" end="00:11:40.900" style="s2">strengthened which is quite interesting</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.580" end="00:14:08.890" style="s2">thinking about Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.050" end="00:14:11.260" style="s2">because of course you know that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.890" end="00:14:13.000" style="s2">Nietzsche was the philosopher who</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.260" end="00:14:14.950" style="s2">announced the death of God right and who</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.000" end="00:14:17.140" style="s2">was a great great critic of Christianity</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.089" end="00:14:23.950" style="s2">and he announced the death of God and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:25.540" style="s2">said that we&#39;d never find enough water</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.950" end="00:14:27.579" style="s2">to wash away the blood it wasn&#39;t a</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.579" end="00:14:33.700" style="s2">often read that way and don&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.079" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">conclusion from that from the death of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.700" end="00:14:36.430" style="s2">God the fact that our ethical systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:37.930" style="s2">were going to collapse when the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.430" end="00:14:39.610" style="s2">foundation was pulled out from</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.930" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">underneath them he believed that human</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.610" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">beings would have to find their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.829" style="s2">values to create their own values and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:46.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with that because it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.829" end="00:14:49.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem that this is something Carl</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.300" end="00:14:50.589" style="s2">Jung was very thorough in investigating</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.269" end="00:14:52.779" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really look like people are</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.779" end="00:14:56.890" style="s2">because you&#39;re not really capable of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.730" end="00:14:58.690" style="s2">molding yourself just any old way you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.890" end="00:15:01.630" style="s2">want to be like you have a nature that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.690" end="00:15:03.820" style="s2">you have to contend with and so it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.630" end="00:15:05.320" style="s2">a matter of creating our own values</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.820" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have that capacity it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.320" end="00:15:09.100" style="s2">might be a matter of rediscovering those</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:12.670" style="s2">values which is what human was</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.100" end="00:15:14.260" style="s2">attempting to do now and and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.670" end="00:15:16.810" style="s2">think Nietzsche was actually profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.260" end="00:15:18.279" style="s2">wrong in that in that recommendation I</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.810" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">think he was psychologically wrong now</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.279" end="00:15:24.579" style="s2">you know Dostoevsky wrote in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:26.140" style="s2">in parallel to Nietzsche was a great</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.579" end="00:15:27.670" style="s2">influence on Nietzsche their lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.140" end="00:15:29.740" style="s2">parallel each other to a degree that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.670" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">somewhat miraculous in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.740" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s quite uncanny Dorothea Eskie was</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">obviously a literary figure whereas</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:38.850" style="s2">nature was a philosopher a literary</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">philosopher but still a philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.850" end="00:15:43.240" style="s2">Dostoyevsky wrestled with exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:45.730" style="s2">same problems that that Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.240" end="00:15:47.980" style="s2">wrestled with and but he did it in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.730" end="00:15:50.709" style="s2">different way he didn&#39;t literary matter</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.980" end="00:15:52.149" style="s2">and he has this great book and The</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.709" end="00:15:54.370" style="s2">Brothers Karamazov and in that book</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.149" end="00:15:57.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a hero of the book is really a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.370" end="00:15:59.949" style="s2">lyosha who&#39;s a monastic novitiate a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.190" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">good guy kind of not an intellect not an</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.949" end="00:16:03.760" style="s2">intellect but a person of great</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:05.290" style="s2">character you know and but he has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.760" end="00:16:07.060" style="s2">brother Ivan who&#39;s his older brother</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.290" end="00:16:08.170" style="s2">who&#39;s a great intellect and and a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.060" end="00:16:10.300" style="s2">handsome so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.170" end="00:16:12.790" style="s2">a brave man and like Dostoyevsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.300" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">villains Ivan isn&#39;t exactly a villain</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.790" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">but that&#39;s close enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:18.339" style="s2">Ivan our Dostoevsky makes his villains</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:19.480" style="s2">extraordinarily powerful so if dusty</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.339" end="00:16:23.170" style="s2">esti is trying to work out an argument</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.480" end="00:16:25.570" style="s2">he he closed the argument in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.170" end="00:16:27.070" style="s2">flesh of one of his characters and if</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.570" end="00:16:28.870" style="s2">it&#39;s an argument he doesn&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.070" end="00:16:30.490" style="s2">and he makes that character as strong as</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.870" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">he possibly can as strong and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.490" end="00:16:33.910" style="s2">attractive and intelligent as he</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:37.240" style="s2">possibly can and then he lets him just</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.910" end="00:16:39.670" style="s2">have at her and so Ivan is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.240" end="00:16:41.290" style="s2">attacking Elly OSHA and from every</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.670" end="00:16:43.810" style="s2">direction trying to knock him off his</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:51.010" style="s2">Ivan&#39;s criticisms and and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.240" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">have the intellect for it and and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.010" end="00:16:56.649" style="s2">Ivan has a devastating intellect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:57.850" style="s2">devastating to him himself as well what</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.649" end="00:17:00.430" style="s2">happens in the brothers karamazov</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.850" end="00:17:03.370" style="s2">essentially is that Alyosha continues to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.430" end="00:17:05.740" style="s2">act out his commitment to the good let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.370" end="00:17:07.150" style="s2">say and in that manner he&#39;s triumphant</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.740" end="00:17:08.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter that he loses the</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.470" end="00:17:12.910" style="s2">exactly the point the arguments in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.660" end="00:17:14.860" style="s2">sense are a side issue because the issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.910" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">is and this is the existential issue the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.860" end="00:17:19.270" style="s2">issue is not what you believe as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:21.699" style="s2">a set of facts but how you conduct</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.270" end="00:17:23.230" style="s2">yourself in the world and so Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.699" end="00:17:25.709" style="s2">he grasped that and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">things that makes him such a amazing</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.709" end="00:17:31.510" style="s2">amazing literary figure an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:34.030" style="s2">genius because he was smart enough to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.510" end="00:17:35.290" style="s2">formulate the arguments in a manner that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.030" end="00:17:36.669" style="s2">no one else really could with the</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.669" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">that&#39;s quite an exception and yet he</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">could still using his dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:45.070" style="s2">embodiment he could still lay out</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.030" end="00:18:51.880" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s so powerful about</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:53.800" style="s2">the Abrahamic stories is that it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.180" end="00:19:11.350" style="s2">of the things that makes the story so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.470" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">realistic as far as I&#39;m concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.350" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">Abraham rose up early in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:17.470" style="s2">took bread and a bottle of water and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:19.720" style="s2">gave it unto Hagar putting it on her</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.470" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">shoulder and the child and sent her away</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.720" end="00:19:27.480" style="s2">and she departed and wandered in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:29.530" style="s2">wilderness of Beersheba I found the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.480" end="00:19:31.270" style="s2">funny I guess this had more of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.530" end="00:19:32.650" style="s2">emotional impact on me this week than it</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.270" end="00:19:34.600" style="s2">might have because my daughter just had</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.650" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">a baby a week ago and so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.600" end="00:19:39.790" style="s2">thinking about this sort of thing know</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:42.430" style="s2">was so happy that that&#39;s happened and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.790" end="00:19:44.290" style="s2">was trying to put myself and uh what</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.430" end="00:19:46.750" style="s2">would you say the conceptual space of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.290" end="00:19:48.940" style="s2">the people about who these stories or</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.750" end="00:19:51.250" style="s2">people who these stories are about and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.940" end="00:19:53.410" style="s2">trying to you know notice that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.250" end="00:19:55.720" style="s2">catastrophe that this sort of breakup</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:19:57.400" style="s2">would actually constitute and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.720" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">and the visual images really helped with</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.400" end="00:20:01.750" style="s2">that because they&#39;re they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:03.610" style="s2">carefully crafted and and they hid the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.750" end="00:20:05.800" style="s2">story from so many different directions</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.610" end="00:20:08.470" style="s2">that you know they add that an</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.800" end="00:20:10.440" style="s2">additional layer of ocean meaning to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.470" end="00:20:13.060" style="s2">which I found very very significant and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:15.250" style="s2">the water was spent in the bottle and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.060" end="00:20:17.140" style="s2">she cast the child under one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.250" end="00:20:18.850" style="s2">shrubs and she sent to wander in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.140" end="00:20:19.870" style="s2">desert you know so it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.850" end="00:20:22.690" style="s2">she has to leave</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.870" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s household it&#39;s that where she</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.690" end="00:20:28.300" style="s2">goes is not really amenable to life and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:32.590" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s an extraordinarily dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.300" end="00:20:34.660" style="s2">and terrible tale and she went and sat</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.590" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">her down over against him a good way off</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.660" end="00:20:38.440" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:40.990" style="s2">were a bow shot for she said let me not</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.440" end="00:20:42.850" style="s2">see the death of the child and she sat</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.990" end="00:20:47.049" style="s2">over against him and lift up her voice</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.850" end="00:20:49.539" style="s2">and wept and God heard the voice of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.049" end="00:20:51.309" style="s2">loud and the angel of God called to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.539" end="00:20:56.350" style="s2">Hagar out of heaven and said unto her</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.309" end="00:20:58.389" style="s2">what aileth thee Hagar fear not for God</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.350" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">have heard the voice of the lad where he</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.389" end="00:21:04.269" style="s2">is rise lift up the loud and hold him in</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:08.379" style="s2">9 hand for I will make him a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.269" end="00:21:10.299" style="s2">nation and God opened her eyes and she</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.379" end="00:21:14.409" style="s2">saw a well of water and she went and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.299" end="00:21:19.450" style="s2">filled the bog with water and gave the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.409" end="00:21:21.070" style="s2">lad drink and God was with the lad and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.450" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.070" end="00:21:25.899" style="s2">became an archer that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:28.029" style="s2">relevant detail to the fact that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.899" end="00:21:29.320" style="s2">became an archer because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.029" end="00:21:31.299" style="s2">mentioned to you at one point that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.320" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">word sin is derived from a Greek word</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.299" end="00:21:34.509" style="s2">amar kiya even though it sounds nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:38.019" style="s2">like that word and Hammar kiya is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.509" end="00:21:41.049" style="s2">actually a an archery term and it means</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.019" end="00:21:43.659" style="s2">- it means to miss the bullseye and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.049" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a lovely metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.659" end="00:21:48.370" style="s2">sin I think because it&#39;s associated so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:51.220" style="s2">tightly with the idea of of goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.370" end="00:21:53.889" style="s2">direction and and aim you know because</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.220" end="00:21:56.350" style="s2">there&#39;s an emetic Oracle idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.889" end="00:21:57.879" style="s2">embedded in that in that image and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.350" end="00:22:00.700" style="s2">is that you know a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.879" end="00:22:02.139" style="s2">something that specifies a target which</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.700" end="00:22:03.490" style="s2">we do all the time with their eyes by</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.139" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">the way I mean our eyes our target</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:08.649" style="s2">specifying mechanisms you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:10.990" style="s2">very precise central focal vision and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.649" end="00:22:12.850" style="s2">use our focal vision to target the aim</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.990" end="00:22:15.129" style="s2">of our behavior and so we are aiming</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.850" end="00:22:17.710" style="s2">creatures there&#39;s our it&#39;s built right</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.129" end="00:22:19.240" style="s2">into our Plouffe or body or we&#39;re built</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.710" end="00:22:21.639" style="s2">on a hunting platform or aiming</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.240" end="00:22:24.100" style="s2">creatures and we do that cognitively as</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.639" end="00:22:25.750" style="s2">well as behaviorally and so as hunters</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.100" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">we take aim at things that we take aim</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.750" end="00:22:28.840" style="s2">at moving targets and we&#39;re very good at</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:31.029" style="s2">bringing them down and we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.840" end="00:22:33.129" style="s2">that for who knows how long millions of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.029" end="00:22:34.929" style="s2">years really even chimpanzees are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.129" end="00:22:36.580" style="s2">carnivorous by the way at least but from</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.929" end="00:22:39.279" style="s2">them about 6 million years ago so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.580" end="00:22:41.559" style="s2">been hunting and aiming for a very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.279" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">long period of time and we still have</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.559" end="00:22:44.649" style="s2">aims in our life right and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:45.970" style="s2">describe them what are you aiming at or</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.649" end="00:22:49.270" style="s2">what are your aims what are your goals</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.970" end="00:22:52.090" style="s2">what&#39;s your target it&#39;s all based on</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.270" end="00:22:54.070" style="s2">not hunting metaphor and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.090" end="00:22:56.140" style="s2">Ishmael becomes an archer means that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.070" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">he&#39;s someone who can take him at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.140" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">center of the bullseye and hit it</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">precisely and so that&#39;s an indication</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:09.100" style="s2">that he&#39;s a good man right so and and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:10.780" style="s2">suppose also part of the part of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.100" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2">carries part of the narrative weight of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.780" end="00:23:13.720" style="s2">the story because of course he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.860" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s son and you&#39;d expect Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.720" end="00:23:17.140" style="s2">son to be someone who&#39;s very good at</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:18.970" style="s2">taking aim and he dwelt in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.140" end="00:23:20.950" style="s2">wilderness of paran and he could live</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.970" end="00:23:23.140" style="s2">there and survive which is no trivial</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.950" end="00:23:26.860" style="s2">thing and his mother took him a wife out</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.140" end="00:23:28.150" style="s2">of the land of Egypt okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.860" end="00:23:29.710" style="s2">story of Hagar and it&#39;s a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.150" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">straightforward story it&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.710" end="00:23:35.320" style="s2">emotionally but it doesn&#39;t and it and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:38.010" style="s2">brings up the terrible theme of familial</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.320" end="00:23:40.840" style="s2">catastrophe and the complications of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.010" end="00:23:43.030" style="s2">romantic and familial relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.840" end="00:23:45.460" style="s2">all of that but it&#39;s really serves as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.030" end="00:23:48.070" style="s2">pro drama to the next story which is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.460" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">one that&#39;s so complex and so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.070" end="00:23:57.180" style="s2">to understand and it came to pass after</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:59.470" style="s2">these things that God did tempt Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.180" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">which is a funny thing for God to do I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.470" end="00:24:09.190" style="s2">suppose and said unto Him Abraham and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:13.060" style="s2">said behold Here I am and God said take</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.929" end="00:24:49.149" style="s2">and saw the place afar off the neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.809" end="00:24:51.789" style="s2">hem said unto his young men abide ye ye</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.789" end="00:25:00.909" style="s2">go yonder and worship and come again to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.970" end="00:25:02.620" style="s2">you it&#39;s really one of the first times</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.909" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">that we&#39;ve come across the word worship</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.620" end="00:25:06.090" style="s2">if I remember correctly and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:10.450" style="s2">very difficult word to contend with to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.090" end="00:25:11.620" style="s2">know is he if you like me or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.450" end="00:25:12.610" style="s2">like me when I was a kid because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.620" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought about this for a long</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:16.389" style="s2">time it was never really obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:18.429" style="s2">why God would want to be worshipped you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.389" end="00:25:20.889" style="s2">know as to go to church and you offer up</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.429" end="00:25:22.990" style="s2">your praise and thanks to God and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.889" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">say well really does that make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.990" end="00:25:26.710" style="s2">sense it&#39;s like why in the world is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:29.110" style="s2">what he wants it&#39;s like it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.710" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re kneeling</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:46.659" style="s2">think that&#39;s because it&#39;s it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.409" end="00:25:48.549" style="s2">proper way of conceptualizing it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.659" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">what happens when you see what Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.549" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">does continually and this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">implicit in the use of the word worship</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">in this particular situation is that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:00.490" style="s2">know he as we discussed he has an</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.690" end="00:26:02.019" style="s2">adventure in his life that comes to an</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.490" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">end so there&#39;s an episode in this life</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.019" end="00:26:06.370" style="s2">it comes to an end and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:08.409" style="s2">period of you might consider it re where</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.370" end="00:26:10.120" style="s2">he reconstitutes himself to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.409" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s that&#39;s when he makes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.120" end="00:26:14.260" style="s2">sacrifices and it seems to me that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">that reconstitution that constitutes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.260" end="00:26:18.100" style="s2">worship the worship is something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:19.750" style="s2">you know this is alluding back to my</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.100" end="00:26:22.059" style="s2">original proposition that it&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.750" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">act that&#39;s the issue and the worship is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.059" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">the decision to enact the good in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:28.659" style="s2">whatever form it is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:30.820" style="s2">conceptualize it as well as trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.659" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">continually reconceptualize the good in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.820" end="00:26:34.299" style="s2">a manner that makes the good that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:36.850" style="s2">conceptualizing even that much better</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.299" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">right because when you start aiming the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.850" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:40.950" style="s2">aiming in the right direction is very</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:43.090" style="s2">low but</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.950" end="00:26:45.610" style="s2">hypothetically as you aim and as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.090" end="00:26:48.100" style="s2">practice and as you learn the target is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.610" end="00:26:48.910" style="s2">going to shift in front of your eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.100" end="00:26:50.980" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to follow</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.910" end="00:26:53.380" style="s2">whatever more clearly and so and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.980" end="00:26:55.510" style="s2">seems to me and especially given the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.380" end="00:26:57.040" style="s2">context that this word is used in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.510" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">particular story is much more</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.040" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">appropriate interpretation of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:03.280" style="s2">constitutes proper worship and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:05.590" style="s2">it&#39;s akin to the later Christian idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.280" end="00:27:08.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s the imitation of Christ that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.590" end="00:27:11.380" style="s2">the sacred duty of every Christian of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.800" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">every Christian and every human being I</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.380" end="00:27:16.630" style="s2">suppose insofar as that&#39;s an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:19.480" style="s2">idea an idea is something like well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.630" end="00:27:22.420" style="s2">the embodiment of the good that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.480" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">issue and it&#39;s not your stated belief in</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.420" end="00:27:25.990" style="s2">the good and you know when nature was</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">criticizing Christianity this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.990" end="00:27:29.350" style="s2">actually one of the things that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:30.910" style="s2">brought up as a major issue he said that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.350" end="00:27:33.070" style="s2">he believed Christianity had lost its</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.910" end="00:27:35.890" style="s2">way because it had introduced a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:37.210" style="s2">confusion between stated belief which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.890" end="00:27:39.220" style="s2">say your belief in the divinity of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:41.290" style="s2">Christ whatever it means if you state</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.220" end="00:27:42.760" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t obvious what it means that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.290" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">when you state that because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.760" end="00:27:45.910" style="s2">obvious what it would mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:48.040" style="s2">believe it or even what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.910" end="00:27:49.780" style="s2">you&#39;re believing in as far as Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.040" end="00:27:51.640" style="s2">was concerned in some sense not only was</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.780" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">that beside the point it was dangerously</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.640" end="00:27:58.120" style="s2">beside the point because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:28:00.220" style="s2">allowed the Christian believer not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.120" end="00:28:03.100" style="s2">adopt the moral burden that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.220" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">appropriate to the faith which was - and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.100" end="00:28:08.680" style="s2">this is I&#39;m using a kind of a Union</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:10.630" style="s2">concept here to manifest the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.680" end="00:28:13.060" style="s2">within the confines of your own life</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.630" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s to make the divine that your</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:22.330" style="s2">realizable in the context of your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.380" end="00:28:24.160" style="s2">life which is to say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.330" end="00:28:26.170" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.160" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">again to act out the highest good of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.170" end="00:28:29.230" style="s2">which you&#39;re capable now that will</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">transform your life to some degree into</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.230" end="00:28:33.750" style="s2">an archetypal adventure there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:36.310" style="s2">around that because as you attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.750" end="00:28:37.990" style="s2">climb a higher mountain let&#39;s say or to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.310" end="00:28:39.700" style="s2">aim at a higher target or something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.990" end="00:28:42.430" style="s2">that then the things around you will</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.700" end="00:28:44.460" style="s2">become increasingly dramatic and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.430" end="00:28:46.810" style="s2">import that happens by necessity</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.460" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">obviously because if you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.810" end="00:28:50.890" style="s2">something difficult and profound and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:52.270" style="s2">you&#39;re really working at it then your</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.890" end="00:28:54.430" style="s2">life is going to become perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.270" end="00:28:54.759" style="s2">increasingly difficult and profound but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.430" end="00:28:56.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.759" end="00:28:58.929" style="s2">might be okay you might that might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.079" end="00:29:01.509" style="s2">exactly what you need as an antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.929" end="00:29:14.199" style="s2">the implicit limitations that face you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.509" end="00:29:15.759" style="s2">as a human being so and I am the lad</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.199" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">will go yonder and worship and come</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.759" end="00:29:20.049" style="s2">again to you now there&#39;s an implication</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.559" end="00:29:22.659" style="s2">here too that it&#39;s a foreshadowing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.049" end="00:29:24.249" style="s2">that Abraham offering up his son is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.659" end="00:29:26.199" style="s2">actually a form of worship and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.249" end="00:29:28.869" style="s2">that it&#39;s continuous with what he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.129" end="00:29:38.949" style="s2">written and then all return to this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.259" end="00:29:43.329" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how that goes so life is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.949" end="00:29:46.239" style="s2">suffering that&#39;s clear there&#39;s no more</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.329" end="00:29:49.269" style="s2">basic irrefutable truth it&#39;s basically</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.780" end="01:00:28.480" style="s2">the Lord called unto him out of heaven</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.000" end="01:00:31.610" style="s2">and said Abraham and he said here am I</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.480" end="01:00:33.380" style="s2">an angel said lay not thine hand upon</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.610" end="01:00:35.690" style="s2">the lad neither do thou anything unto</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.380" end="01:00:38.840" style="s2">him for now I know that thou fearest God</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.690" end="01:00:42.010" style="s2">seeing thou hast not withheld thy son an</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.840" end="01:00:42.010" style="s2">only son from me</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.130" end="01:00:53.880" style="s2">when I was answering the questions last</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.660" end="01:00:55.859" style="s2">night at this Q&amp;A this guy asked me this</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.880" end="01:00:59.819" style="s2">question he said that he had parents who</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.859" end="01:01:06.029" style="s2">were desperate anti-social alcoholic</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.819" end="01:01:08.609" style="s2">addicted friendless and that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.029" end="01:01:13.410" style="s2">want him to leave their home he was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.609" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">only relationship they had but that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.410" end="01:01:20.670" style="s2">of he was the only relationship they had</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:24.509" style="s2">and he asked what he should do and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.670" end="01:01:30.450" style="s2">told him that he should leave and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.509" end="01:01:34.499" style="s2">reason for that is that you have a moral</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.450" end="01:01:37.099" style="s2">obligation as a parent to encourage your</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.499" end="01:01:41.999" style="s2">child to go out into the world right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.099" end="01:01:45.720" style="s2">to be whoever they can be to be the best</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.999" end="01:01:48.059" style="s2">they can possibly be and in doing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.720" end="01:01:51.539" style="s2">you&#39;re offering you&#39;re encouraging them</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.059" end="01:01:55.170" style="s2">to pursue the good you&#39;re sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.539" end="01:01:58.470" style="s2">them to the good you&#39;re not keeping them</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.170" end="01:02:00.329" style="s2">for yourself selfishly you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.470" end="01:02:06.029" style="s2">them that they can go out and live their</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.329" end="01:02:08.970" style="s2">life and live it properly and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.029" end="01:02:13.789" style="s2">the parallel to the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.970" end="01:02:13.789" style="s2">sacrifice of Isaac as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:21.569" style="s2">you don&#39;t want for your son what it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.089" end="01:02:25.529" style="s2">that you want for him you want for your</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.569" end="01:02:30.329" style="s2">son what would be best for him and for</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.529" end="01:02:32.849" style="s2">the world and you let go in precise</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.329" end="01:02:34.950" style="s2">proportion to your desire to have that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.849" end="01:02:36.420" style="s2">happen you know the psychoanalyst the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.950" end="01:02:37.829" style="s2">great psychoanalyst I say the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.420" end="01:02:39.660" style="s2">psychoanalyst I think this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.829" end="01:02:42.440" style="s2">Freud&#39;s dictum but I&#39;m not certain of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.660" end="01:02:45.239" style="s2">that he said the good mother fails</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.440" end="01:02:49.559" style="s2">which is a bit a brilliant observation</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.239" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">because when you have an infant do you</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.559" end="01:02:52.920" style="s2">do everything for the infant because the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:55.950" style="s2">infant can do nothing for him or herself</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.920" end="01:02:59.339" style="s2">but as the infant matures and is</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.950" end="01:03:01.259" style="s2">increasingly capable of doing things for</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.339" end="01:03:02.090" style="s2">him or herself then you pull back right</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.259" end="01:03:04.700" style="s2">you pull</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.090" end="01:03:06.230" style="s2">back and everytime the child develops</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.700" end="01:03:08.750" style="s2">the ability to do something you allow</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.230" end="01:03:10.790" style="s2">them or encourage them to do it and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.750" end="01:03:12.350" style="s2">don&#39;t interfere you know so if your</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.790" end="01:03:14.150" style="s2">child is struggling getting dressed well</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.350" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s some times that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.150" end="01:03:17.870" style="s2">help them but mostly you let them learn</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:19.790" style="s2">so that they can know how to do it in</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.870" end="01:03:21.320" style="s2">the future that&#39;s better for you and</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.790" end="01:03:23.240" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly better for them there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.320" end="01:03:24.590" style="s2">rule if you&#39;re working with the elderly</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.240" end="01:03:27.320" style="s2">in an old-age home and the rule is</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.590" end="01:03:31.370" style="s2">something like don&#39;t do anything for any</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.320" end="01:03:33.980" style="s2">of the for any of the guests let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.370" end="01:03:36.200" style="s2">that they can do for themselves because</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.980" end="01:03:38.270" style="s2">you compromise their independence and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.200" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">as a mother you pull back and you pull</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.270" end="01:03:42.800" style="s2">back and you let your child hit him or</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:45.320" style="s2">herself against the world and you fail</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.800" end="01:03:48.590" style="s2">to protect them but by failing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.320" end="01:03:51.050" style="s2">protect them you encourage and ennoble</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.590" end="01:03:54.050" style="s2">them to the point where you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.050" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">necessary now they may still want to see</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.050" end="01:03:57.350" style="s2">you and it would be wonderful if that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:59.540" style="s2">was the case but the point is is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.350" end="01:04:02.570" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to remove yourself from</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.540" end="01:04:05.090" style="s2">the equation by encouraging your child</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.570" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">to be the best possible person that</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.090" end="01:04:12.470" style="s2">person can be and you sacrifice your</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:14.300" style="s2">desires all of your desires to that your</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.470" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">personal desires even your desires for</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.300" end="01:04:18.020" style="s2">your child in relationship to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">because you want them to move forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.020" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">into the world as a light right as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:25.550" style="s2">light on a hill that&#39;s what you want if</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:27.110" style="s2">you have any sense and so you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.550" end="01:04:30.050" style="s2">to keep your children at home because</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.110" end="01:04:32.060" style="s2">you need them now I&#39;m talking generally</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.050" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">obviously and there are circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.060" end="01:04:36.080" style="s2">under which families make their own</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:38.570" style="s2">idiosyncratic decisions and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.080" end="01:04:41.660" style="s2">trying to dam everyone with a with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.570" end="01:04:46.490" style="s2">casual gesture you know but the point is</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.660" end="01:04:48.290" style="s2">still strong that the good father is</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.490" end="01:04:51.280" style="s2">precisely someone who is willing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.290" end="01:04:54.290" style="s2">sacrifice his child to the ultimate good</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.280" end="01:05:00.920" style="s2">that&#39;s dramatized in this story you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.290" end="01:05:02.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s brutal but the world is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.920" end="01:05:05.540" style="s2">brutal place and much wisdom comes out</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.900" end="01:05:07.760" style="s2">of catastrophe and this is an indication</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.540" end="01:05:10.790" style="s2">of how much catastrophe our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.760" end="01:05:13.190" style="s2">had to plow through had to work through</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.790" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">in order to generate the sub structure</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.190" end="01:05:15.710" style="s2">for the conceptions of freedom even that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:17.900" style="s2">we have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.710" end="01:05:20.420" style="s2">they for freedom and the good and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.900" end="01:05:22.310" style="s2">how the story appears to me now I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.420" end="01:05:26.450" style="s2">there&#39;s more to it I think if there has</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.310" end="01:05:28.310" style="s2">to be more to it it lays the groundwork</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.450" end="01:05:30.410" style="s2">at least in the Christian context for</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.310" end="01:05:34.190" style="s2">the eventual emergence of Christ as I</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.410" end="01:05:35.839" style="s2">alluded to in my reading that story</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.190" end="01:05:37.490" style="s2">obviously has to be unpacked and</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:38.810" style="s2">unpacked and unpacked just like it has</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.490" end="01:05:45.980" style="s2">been for the last two thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.810" end="01:05:48.020" style="s2">it&#39;s also an indication here of well I</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.980" end="01:05:50.030" style="s2">would say the transmutation of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.020" end="01:05:51.589" style="s2">into an increasingly psychological form</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.030" end="01:05:53.030" style="s2">which is a development that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.589" end="01:05:55.570" style="s2">tracked all the way through the Old</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.030" end="01:05:59.089" style="s2">Testament up to this particular point</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.570" end="01:06:00.619" style="s2">first acted out then represented in</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.089" end="01:06:03.500" style="s2">ritual those would be the rituals of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.619" end="01:06:06.080" style="s2">sacrifice then laid out in story then</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.500" end="01:06:08.800" style="s2">turned into a psychological phenomena so</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.080" end="01:06:12.580" style="s2">that now we&#39;re capable of making</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.800" end="01:06:15.290" style="s2">sacrifices in abstraction right to</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.580" end="01:06:17.150" style="s2">conceptualize a future that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.290" end="01:06:19.310" style="s2">let go of the things that are stopping</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.150" end="01:06:20.839" style="s2">us from moving forward and to free</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.310" end="01:06:23.540" style="s2">ourselves from the chains of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.839" end="01:06:27.200" style="s2">original preconceptions and that&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.540" end="01:06:29.750" style="s2">out in these old stories as the optimal</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.200" end="01:06:32.030" style="s2">path way of being and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.750" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">philosopher of science named Karl Popper</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.030" end="01:06:36.830" style="s2">very sensible and down-to-earth person</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">who was talking about thinking and its</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.830" end="01:06:40.760" style="s2">nature and he was thought about thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:42.109" style="s2">in a Darwinian fashion he said the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.760" end="01:06:44.990" style="s2">purpose of thinking is to let your</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.109" end="01:06:47.660" style="s2">thoughts die instead of you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.990" end="01:06:51.589" style="s2">brilliant notion and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.660" end="01:06:53.480" style="s2">something like you can conjure up a</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.589" end="01:06:55.160" style="s2">representation of yourself you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.480" end="01:06:57.260" style="s2">conjure up a variety of potential</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.160" end="01:07:00.140" style="s2">representations of yourself in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.260" end="01:07:02.480" style="s2">future you can lay out how those future</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.140" end="01:07:05.720" style="s2">representations of yourself are likely</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.480" end="01:07:07.880" style="s2">to prevail or fail you can call the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.720" end="01:07:09.859" style="s2">potential use in the future that will</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.880" end="01:07:13.810" style="s2">fail and then you can embody the ones</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.859" end="01:07:16.220" style="s2">that will succeed you do that well</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.810" end="01:07:18.190" style="s2">simultaneously conjuring up a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.220" end="01:07:21.230" style="s2">representation of your current state and</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.190" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">determining for yourself because of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.230" end="01:07:26.030" style="s2">undue suffering which elements of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:27.380" style="s2">pathetic being need to be given up so</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.030" end="01:07:28.800" style="s2">that you can move forward into that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.380" end="01:07:31.230" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.800" end="01:07:32.730" style="s2">and the goal what is it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.230" end="01:07:34.470" style="s2">aiming at with that work and not</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.730" end="01:07:35.790" style="s2">sacrifice that&#39;s the ultimate question</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.470" end="01:07:37.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the question I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.790" end="01:07:38.730" style="s2">address in that writing what is it that</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.320" end="01:07:41.490" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do when you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.730" end="01:07:43.170" style="s2">to improve the future we believe that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.490" end="01:07:45.150" style="s2">the future can be improved we believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.170" end="01:07:47.520" style="s2">that it can be improved as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.150" end="01:07:49.500" style="s2">of our sacrificial work and so once</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.520" end="01:07:50.520" style="s2">again what are the limitations what are</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.500" end="01:07:52.200" style="s2">the limits to that what are the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.520" end="01:07:53.790" style="s2">necessary limits to that I would say we</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.200" end="01:07:55.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know I would say as well that</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.790" end="01:07:57.450" style="s2">that&#39;s actually something that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.620" end="01:07:59.700" style="s2">entire corpus of biblical stories is</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.450" end="01:08:03.450" style="s2">trying desperately to articulate to</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.700" end="01:08:05.550" style="s2">figure out and articulate right we we</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.450" end="01:08:07.980" style="s2">conjured up this remarkable idea the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.550" end="01:08:10.290" style="s2">future exists we can see it even though</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.980" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s only potential we can adjust our</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.290" end="01:08:14.340" style="s2">behavior in the present in order to</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:14.820" style="s2">maximize our probability of success in</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.340" end="01:08:18.660" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.820" end="01:08:23.280" style="s2">how best to do that well the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.660" end="01:08:27.780" style="s2">something like don&#39;t hesitate to offer</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.280" end="01:08:31.080" style="s2">the ultimate sacrifice if you want the</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.780" end="01:08:34.770" style="s2">future to turn out ultimately well now</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.080" end="01:08:37.470" style="s2">obviously that idea is closed in</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.770" end="01:08:39.390" style="s2">metaphysical speculation and religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.470" end="01:08:45.720" style="s2">imagery but it still remains an</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.390" end="01:08:50.609" style="s2">intensely practical issue right what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.720" end="01:08:53.400" style="s2">it that you could contract for let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.609" end="01:08:54.990" style="s2">if you were willing to give up</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.400" end="01:08:57.680" style="s2">everything about you that&#39;s weak and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.990" end="01:08:57.680" style="s2">unworthy</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.059" end="01:09:12.329" style="s2">the there&#39;s a there&#39;s a continual hints</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.829" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">of that in the Old Testament right</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.329" end="01:09:17.909" style="s2">because what happens with Noah</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">of course is that he establishes the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.909" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">proper covenant with God the proper</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:25.380" style="s2">contract with being let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.279" end="01:09:27.119" style="s2">thrives as a consequence and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.380" end="01:09:29.009" style="s2">neighborhood does the same thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.119" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">a strong intimation that that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.009" end="01:09:34.139" style="s2">world is set right now that idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:39.539" style="s2">develops and magnifies as the stories</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.139" end="01:09:41.369" style="s2">progress into something like into</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.539" end="01:09:47.029" style="s2">something like the concept of heaven on</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.369" end="01:09:51.109" style="s2">earth the notion being that the proper</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.029" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">sacrificial attitude produces a</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.109" end="01:09:56.699" style="s2">psychological state and then the social</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:10:01.110" style="s2">state that&#39;s a manifestation of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.699" end="01:10:03.829" style="s2">attitude that decreases the probability</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.110" end="01:10:06.599" style="s2">that the world will Carine into hell and</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.829" end="01:10:09.750" style="s2">increases the probability that people</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.599" end="01:10:12.449" style="s2">will live high-quality meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.750" end="01:10:14.760" style="s2">private lives in a society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.449" end="01:10:19.190" style="s2">balanced and capable of supporting that</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.760" end="01:10:19.190" style="s2">and none of that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.309" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">questionable really I also don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:28.139" style="s2">it&#39;s anything that people don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:31.550" style="s2">know you know people have told me many</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.139" end="01:10:33.630" style="s2">times that when they listen to me talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.550" end="01:10:35.730" style="s2">they are hearing things that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.630" end="01:10:37.829" style="s2">already know knew but didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.730" end="01:10:39.239" style="s2">say it&#39;s something like that and this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.829" end="01:10:41.489" style="s2">one of those things that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.239" end="01:10:43.320" style="s2">exactly like that I mean I think it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.489" end="01:10:44.849" style="s2">the very core of our moral knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:46.170" style="s2">which is our behavioral knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.849" end="01:10:46.889" style="s2">our perceptual knowledge I mean let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.170" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">get this straight</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.889" end="01:10:50.309" style="s2">moral knowledge is no trivial matter</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.719" end="01:10:52.050" style="s2">it&#39;s knowledge about how it is that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.309" end="01:10:54.119" style="s2">orient yourself in the world there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.050" end="01:10:54.690" style="s2">more profoundly necessary form of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.119" end="01:10:56.699" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.690" end="01:10:58.679" style="s2">oh it&#39;s predicated on on something</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.699" end="01:11:00.449" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly like this we know that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.679" end="01:11:02.610" style="s2">have to make sacrifices we know that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.449" end="01:11:04.260" style="s2">have to omit what&#39;s good so then why</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.610" end="01:11:05.849" style="s2">isn&#39;t that we don&#39;t aim at what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.260" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">and make the sacrifices that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.849" end="01:11:11.880" style="s2">necessary in order to bring that into</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.440" end="01:11:13.980" style="s2">play I think it seems to me that in some</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.880" end="01:11:15.329" style="s2">sense that&#39;s self-evident the question</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.980" end="01:11:16.860" style="s2">is why we don&#39;t do it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.329" end="01:11:18.480" style="s2">answers to that too already in</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.860" end="01:11:21.570" style="s2">material that we&#39;ve covered life is hard</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.480" end="01:11:24.449" style="s2">and it hurts people it&#39;s ripe with</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.570" end="01:11:27.090" style="s2">limitation and some of its arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.449" end="01:11:28.739" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder and some of its unjust</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.090" end="01:11:30.239" style="s2">and some of it&#39;s worse some of its</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.739" end="01:11:31.800" style="s2">malevolent which is even worse than</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.239" end="01:11:33.989" style="s2">something I haven&#39;t talked about at all</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.800" end="01:11:36.179" style="s2">in this lecture it&#39;s not surprising that</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.989" end="01:11:38.550" style="s2">that combination of vicissitude can turn</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.179" end="01:11:39.989" style="s2">people against being but I think even</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.550" end="01:11:43.820" style="s2">when that happens and even when people</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.989" end="01:11:47.190" style="s2">have the kind of history that if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.820" end="01:11:50.460" style="s2">revealed to you you would say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.190" end="01:11:52.290" style="s2">no wonder you turned out that way the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.460" end="01:11:54.300" style="s2">people who turn out that way still know</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.290" end="01:11:56.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s wrong they still know that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.300" end="01:11:58.500" style="s2">however deep their own suffering however</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.400" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">arbitrary their own suffering however</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.500" end="01:12:02.520" style="s2">much that&#39;s caused by the malevolence of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:05.400" style="s2">others as well as the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.520" end="01:12:07.590" style="s2">existence that that does not in any way</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.400" end="01:12:11.690" style="s2">justify their turning away from the good</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.590" end="01:12:15.150" style="s2">and I believe everyone knows that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.690" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">believe that they know it implicitly</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.150" end="01:12:19.290" style="s2">even if they don&#39;t allow themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:21.540" style="s2">know it explicitly and I believe that if</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.290" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">they violate that idea then they violate</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.540" end="01:12:25.409" style="s2">themselves and that they end up in</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:27.150" style="s2">Kane&#39;s position which is the position of</p>

<p begin="01:12:27.150" end="01:12:40.110" style="s2">that is too great to bear an angel said</p>

<p begin="01:15:49.990" end="01:16:03.670" style="s2">than would be usual tonight so what have</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.370" end="01:16:05.200" style="s2">we established by this point the stories</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.670" end="01:16:10.000" style="s2">that have been revealed so far are</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.200" end="01:16:16.660" style="s2">something like they contain the idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.000" end="01:16:19.410" style="s2">that there&#39;s something divine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.660" end="01:16:22.600" style="s2">analogous to the human capacity for</p>

<p begin="01:16:39.220" end="01:16:45.540" style="s2">the in the nature of being now I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:16:45.540" end="01:16:50.650" style="s2">because in some ways I&#39;m is</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.440" end="01:16:54.460" style="s2">materialistically oriented as modern</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.460" end="01:17:01.870" style="s2">make sense to me in many ways the idea</p>

<p begin="01:17:01.870" end="01:17:07.420" style="s2">about human consciousness and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.750" end="01:17:10.540" style="s2">that&#39;s akin in some sense to the divine</p>

<p begin="01:17:11.620" end="01:17:16.990" style="s2">seems to me to be a very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.070" end="01:17:20.440" style="s2">metaphysical idea and it also seems to</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.990" end="01:17:23.220" style="s2">me to be an idea that is immovable at</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.220" end="01:17:29.530" style="s2">because our entire legal system our</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.969" end="01:19:09.070" style="s2">knowledge it&#39;s something like as far as</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.639" end="01:19:11.469" style="s2">I can tell that you actually don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.070" end="01:19:13.389" style="s2">how to be evil or to be good until</p>

<p begin="01:19:13.389" end="01:19:17.650" style="s2">your own vulnerability because the</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.429" end="01:19:20.199" style="s2">essence of evil is the exploitation of</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.650" end="01:19:23.170" style="s2">vulnerability perhaps for the sake of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.199" end="01:19:26.349" style="s2">that exploitation and I can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.170" end="01:19:29.949" style="s2">how to hurt someone until I know exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.349" end="01:19:31.499" style="s2">how I can be hurt myself and I can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:19:45.239" end="01:19:51.999" style="s2">and with the with the accrual of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.090" end="01:19:53.469" style="s2">knowledge of mortality and good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.999" end="01:19:56.139" style="s2">Adam and Eve are cast out of paradise</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.469" end="01:19:58.510" style="s2">and history begins and that seems right</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.139" end="01:20:00.219" style="s2">to me because I don&#39;t think that history</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.510" end="01:20:01.150" style="s2">did begin before human beings became</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.219" end="01:20:03.219" style="s2">self conscious</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.150" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.219" end="01:20:05.640" style="s2">right if his</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:07.710" style="s2">three doesn&#39;t really begin until people</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.640" end="01:20:09.330" style="s2">become aware of the future history</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.710" end="01:20:11.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really begin until until people</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.330" end="01:20:13.980" style="s2">work and start to build right we still</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.490" end="01:20:15.870" style="s2">live we would still be ensconced in</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.980" end="01:20:18.600" style="s2">essentially an animal existence until</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.870" end="01:20:20.670" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of the future and start to</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.600" end="01:20:22.290" style="s2">buttress herself against it start to</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.670" end="01:20:25.560" style="s2">wear clothing start to build buildings</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.290" end="01:20:27.330" style="s2">start to make cities all in all in</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.560" end="01:20:29.430" style="s2">consequence of having become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.330" end="01:20:31.560" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re fragile and that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.430" end="01:20:33.300" style="s2">future is a dangerous place so that</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.560" end="01:20:34.980" style="s2">seems to me to be existentially correct</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.300" end="01:20:37.350" style="s2">and then we have the story of Cain and</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.980" end="01:20:38.760" style="s2">Abel brilliantly placed immediately</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.350" end="01:20:41.610" style="s2">afterwards and so those are the two</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.760" end="01:20:44.430" style="s2">first two people in history essentially</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.610" end="01:20:46.020" style="s2">and they make sacrifices so that goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.430" end="01:20:47.490" style="s2">along with the idea of the discovery</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.020" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">worked and necessity of work and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.490" end="01:20:53.810" style="s2">discovery of the future and then exactly</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.400" end="01:20:57.000" style="s2">what you&#39;d expect would happen one</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.810" end="01:20:59.310" style="s2">segment of mankind let&#39;s say makes the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.000" end="01:21:01.200" style="s2">sacrifices properly and prevails in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.310" end="01:21:03.900" style="s2">other segment makes the sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.200" end="01:21:05.940" style="s2">improperly and fails and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.900" end="01:21:07.410" style="s2">perfectly reasonable given what you see</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.940" end="01:21:09.870" style="s2">around you because that&#39;s what seems to</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.410" end="01:21:12.960" style="s2">happen all the time and then more</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.870" end="01:21:15.000" style="s2">interestingly I would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.960" end="01:21:19.140" style="s2">sacrificial failure produces</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.000" end="01:21:23.790" style="s2">embitterment right and that embedment</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.140" end="01:21:26.250" style="s2">produces a hatred for being and a desire</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.790" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">for revenge that seems perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.250" end="01:21:31.260" style="s2">appropriate when I look at people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:32.760" style="s2">are bitter and who want revenge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.260" end="01:21:35.250" style="s2">generally because their sacrificial</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.760" end="01:21:37.320" style="s2">efforts have failed now I&#39;m loathe to</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.250" end="01:21:39.750" style="s2">say that that&#39;s a matter of their own</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.320" end="01:21:47.100" style="s2">doing although sometimes it clearly is</p>

<p begin="01:21:47.100" end="01:21:55.050" style="s2">to God and blame him for the structure</p>

<p begin="01:24:40.290" end="01:24:46.470" style="s2">the car in the GU leg and he was there</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.630" end="01:24:48.300" style="s2">for a very long time and he said that he</p>

<p begin="01:25:27.920" end="01:25:33.300" style="s2">dangerous line of argumentation you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:35.310" style="s2">because who wants to be the one who</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.300" end="01:25:37.200" style="s2">blames the victim for the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.310" end="01:25:38.880" style="s2">you know you have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.200" end="01:25:40.410" style="s2">when you walk down that road but</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.880" end="01:25:43.590" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn was speaking about himself</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.410" end="01:25:48.720" style="s2">and he said well he was a communist you</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.590" end="01:25:51.300" style="s2">know and he arrogantly and forthrightly</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.720" end="01:25:55.530" style="s2">moved the movement out into the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.300" end="01:25:57.930" style="s2">and had not fully gone over his life</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.530" end="01:26:00.540" style="s2">with a fine-tooth comb to find out what</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.930" end="01:26:03.180" style="s2">mistakes he had made that brought him so</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.540" end="01:26:05.220" style="s2">low but his contention eventually was</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.180" end="01:26:08.010" style="s2">that part of the reason that he ended up</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.220" end="01:26:10.740" style="s2">where he ended up was because he and</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.010" end="01:26:12.090" style="s2">many others had completely forfeited</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.740" end="01:26:14.240" style="s2">their relationship with the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.090" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">allowed their society to degenerate into</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.240" end="01:26:21.120" style="s2">deceit and tyrannical catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:24.150" style="s2">without mounting sufficient opposition</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.120" end="01:26:27.630" style="s2">and so he decided when he was in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.150" end="01:26:30.300" style="s2">camps to straighten himself out bit by</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.630" end="01:26:32.220" style="s2">bit and that culminated in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.300" end="01:26:35.700" style="s2">production of the Gulag Archipelago in</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.220" end="01:26:38.130" style="s2">that book really demolished once and for</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.700" end="01:26:40.260" style="s2">all any moral credibility that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.130" end="01:26:43.760" style="s2">communist totalitarian systems had left</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.260" end="01:26:44.910" style="s2">and so one man in the depths of</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.760" end="01:26:45.540" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.910" end="01:26:47.490" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.540" end="01:26:50.390" style="s2">and through good example at least in</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.490" end="01:26:54.180" style="s2">part to stop lying produced a book</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.390" end="01:26:55.890" style="s2">eventually the demolished the foundation</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.180" end="01:26:57.750" style="s2">of the very system that had imprisoned</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.890" end="01:27:01.410" style="s2">him and that is really worth thinking</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.750" end="01:27:04.290" style="s2">about that&#39;s one example of the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.410" end="01:27:06.780" style="s2">grandeur of the human soul and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.290" end="01:27:11.190" style="s2">capacity for transformation that it has</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.780" end="01:27:12.960" style="s2">when let loose properly on the world so</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.190" end="01:27:15.060" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re conceptualizing your</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.960" end="01:27:16.560" style="s2">own failure you know and you meditated</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.060" end="01:27:19.170" style="s2">on it and you come to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.560" end="01:27:21.480" style="s2">that God forced Cain to pay not only</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.170" end="01:27:24.840" style="s2">have things not been going very well for</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.480" end="01:27:27.060" style="s2">you but it&#39;s actually your fault and not</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.840" end="01:27:29.370" style="s2">only that you brought it on yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.060" end="01:27:31.050" style="s2">not only that you knew it all the time</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.370" end="01:27:33.060" style="s2">well then you might think you&#39;ll wake up</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.050" end="01:27:34.710" style="s2">and fly right right you&#39;ll get your</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.060" end="01:27:36.180" style="s2">wings in order and fly right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.710" end="01:27:38.490" style="s2">no reason to assume that at all and</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.180" end="01:27:40.740" style="s2">that&#39;s not what happens to Cain that</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.490" end="01:27:42.270" style="s2">just makes him more bitter right and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.740" end="01:27:43.830" style="s2">can understand that if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.270" end="01:27:45.240" style="s2">it just for a second it&#39;s like bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.830" end="01:27:47.100" style="s2">enough when something horrible happens</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.240" end="01:27:49.830" style="s2">to you but then to have to swallow the</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.100" end="01:27:51.840" style="s2">additional pill right have to take in</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.830" end="01:27:52.770" style="s2">the information that you could have done</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.840" end="01:27:54.930" style="s2">something different</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.770" end="01:27:56.850" style="s2">it was avoidable and you knew it at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.930" end="01:27:58.770" style="s2">time and you decided to do it anyways</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.850" end="01:28:00.990" style="s2">and I think people are in that situation</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.770" end="01:28:02.970" style="s2">a lot more often than ever anyone is</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.990" end="01:28:04.320" style="s2">willing to admit you know you have that</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.970" end="01:28:09.600" style="s2">little voice in the back of your head</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.320" end="01:28:12.030" style="s2">that says don&#39;t do it and you override</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.600" end="01:28:13.230" style="s2">it and you know it&#39;s arrogance that</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.030" end="01:28:15.270" style="s2">makes you override it it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.230" end="01:28:17.340" style="s2">arrogance you know it always warns you</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.270" end="01:28:20.040" style="s2">to always arrogance yeah I can get away</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.340" end="01:28:21.960" style="s2">with it it&#39;s like no you can&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.040" end="01:28:23.970" style="s2">think you ever get away with anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.960" end="01:28:25.710" style="s2">so and maybe your experience has taught</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.970" end="01:28:28.050" style="s2">you different but my suspicions are it</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.710" end="01:28:32.060" style="s2">hasn&#39;t and if you think it has well the</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.050" end="01:28:34.890" style="s2">other shoe hasn&#39;t yet dropped so Cain</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.060" end="01:28:39.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take the opportunity to let</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.890" end="01:28:41.760" style="s2">God&#39;s wisdom reorient his character and</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.000" end="01:28:43.860" style="s2">that that could have been outcome he</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.760" end="01:28:46.860" style="s2">could have got down on his knees so to</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.860" end="01:28:48.390" style="s2">speak and said oh my oh my god I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.860" end="01:28:49.710" style="s2">wrong all along I&#39;ve been living</p>

<p begin="01:28:57.150" end="01:29:01.870" style="s2">myself out and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.780" end="01:29:03.640" style="s2">and and and live in repentance and</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.870" end="01:29:06.100" style="s2">improve my position but that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.640" end="01:29:09.730" style="s2">he did at all he said all right fair</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.100" end="01:29:13.420" style="s2">enough I get it it&#39;s like I&#39;m going to</p>

<p begin="01:30:44.889" end="01:30:49.190" style="s2">well at least I think there are plenty</p>

<p begin="01:30:57.170" end="01:31:00.710" style="s2">illuminated then you need to know a lot</p>

<p begin="01:31:12.889" end="01:31:18.650" style="s2">a very complicated idea but part of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.340" end="01:31:20.420" style="s2">part of it part of it is associated with</p>

<p begin="01:31:35.690" end="01:31:40.429" style="s2">makeup and then to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.820" end="01:31:42.500" style="s2">for it and I think that in the aftermath</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.429" end="01:31:44.119" style="s2">of the terrible 20th century that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.500" end="01:31:46.369" style="s2">we&#39;re left with we are left with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.119" end="01:31:48.429" style="s2">necessity to take responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.369" end="01:31:50.900" style="s2">most terrible aspects of ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.429" end="01:31:54.310" style="s2">that way perhaps we can stop those</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.900" end="01:31:54.310" style="s2">terrible things from happening again</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.689" end="01:32:06.429" style="s2">that also means you know that you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:32:08.169" end="01:32:13.539" style="s2">malevolence outside yourself right it</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.349" end="01:32:15.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t someone else even though sometimes</p>

<p begin="01:32:15.039" end="01:32:18.729" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s like there are identifiable</p>

<p begin="01:32:18.729" end="01:32:22.989" style="s2">the point the point is something more</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.069" end="01:32:24.969" style="s2">like that the proper place for the</p>

<p begin="01:32:24.969" end="01:32:29.019" style="s2">least the proper place to start is</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.669" end="01:32:31.030" style="s2">within the confines of your own</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.019" end="01:32:33.909" style="s2">existence and then perhaps within the</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.030" end="01:32:36.849" style="s2">confines of your family and that way</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.909" end="01:32:39.099" style="s2">you&#39;re not a danger to those that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.849" end="01:32:40.869" style="s2">miss apprehend as malevolent and evil</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.099" end="01:32:43.299" style="s2">because you won&#39;t get your aim right to</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.299" end="01:32:50.199" style="s2">improperly and you&#39;ll take your revenge</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.729" end="01:32:53.079" style="s2">in a manner that allows you to omit your</p>

<p begin="01:33:12.699" end="01:33:18.519" style="s2">comes the flood right which seems</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.339" end="01:33:20.469" style="s2">perfectly miraculously reasonable to me</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.519" end="01:33:22.559" style="s2">because what those stories do it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.469" end="01:33:24.849" style="s2">amazing that the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.559" end="01:33:28.479" style="s2">segues into the story of the flood</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.849" end="01:33:30.939" style="s2">because it is the case that the</p>

<p begin="01:33:30.939" end="01:33:35.199" style="s2">be conceptualized as the spread of</p>

<p begin="01:33:40.719" end="01:33:44.949" style="s2">pathology to the point where everything</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.280" end="01:33:46.749" style="s2">comes apart and I truly believe that if</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.949" end="01:33:48.339" style="s2">you familiarize yourself with the last</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.749" end="01:33:50.499" style="s2">hundred years of history that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.339" end="01:33:52.449" style="s2">conclusion that you would derive and the</p>

<p begin="01:34:15.550" end="01:34:20.620" style="s2">terrible message because it puts the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.410" end="01:34:23.140" style="s2">burden on you but it&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.620" end="01:34:26.380" style="s2">message because it also means that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.140" end="01:34:29.440" style="s2">could be the source of the process that</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.380" end="01:34:32.710" style="s2">stops that catastrophe and malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.440" end="01:34:34.630" style="s2">from ever emerging again and you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.710" end="01:34:37.210" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to imagine that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.630" end="01:34:39.880" style="s2">have anything that could possibly be</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.210" end="01:34:43.870" style="s2">better to do with the time that you have</p>

<p begin="01:35:26.550" end="01:35:30.460" style="s2">and you told their stories and you</p>

<p begin="01:35:30.460" end="01:35:33.790" style="s2">story maybe you&#39;d have a story like the</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.080" end="01:35:37.060" style="s2">story of Noah or the story of Abraham</p>

<p begin="01:35:39.310" end="01:35:42.820" style="s2">not the cancer on the planet that</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.200" end="01:35:46.450" style="s2">certain people tend to think that we are</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.820" end="01:35:48.250" style="s2">and so the goal is to be one of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.450" end="01:35:49.660" style="s2">people like that and there isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:35:55.240" end="01:35:59.020" style="s2">because you want to ride out the storm</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.560" end="01:36:01.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be happy because</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.020" end="01:36:02.920" style="s2">that&#39;ll just happen if it does or if it</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.120" end="01:36:04.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but you definitely want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.920" end="01:36:06.460" style="s2">constitute yourself so that you can ride</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.660" end="01:36:08.290" style="s2">out the storm because the storm is</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.460" end="01:36:09.880" style="s2">always coming and so then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.290" end="01:36:13.000" style="s2">fortified against the worst and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.880" end="01:36:16.210" style="s2">what you want because well the best you</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.000" end="01:36:18.460" style="s2">can handle the worst you have to prepare</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.210" end="01:36:19.960" style="s2">yourself for and then we see the same</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.460" end="01:36:22.030" style="s2">thing repeated in the story of Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.960" end="01:36:24.520" style="s2">essentially right Abraham makes this</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.030" end="01:36:25.719" style="s2">contract with the good and constantly</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.520" end="01:36:27.519" style="s2">renews it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.719" end="01:36:30.309" style="s2">cough ice and his worship he constantly</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.519" end="01:36:32.289" style="s2">renews it and he has the adventures that</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.309" end="01:36:34.449" style="s2">are sufficiently typical of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.289" end="01:36:37.719" style="s2">adventures of a human being who&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.449" end="01:36:39.820" style="s2">and engaging in the world right he he</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.719" end="01:36:43.479" style="s2">bumps himself up against all the horrors</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.820" end="01:36:46.389" style="s2">of existence and yet the story is told</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.479" end="01:36:48.760" style="s2">in such a manner that reveals that his</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.389" end="01:36:52.119" style="s2">primary ethical commitment to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.760" end="01:36:54.460" style="s2">overarching good is sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.119" end="01:36:57.489" style="s2">protect him against the vicissitudes of</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.460" end="01:37:00.599" style="s2">existence well that&#39;s an optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.489" end="01:37:03.280" style="s2">story and as a pessimistic person I</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.599" end="01:37:06.849" style="s2">appreciate an optimistic story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.280" end="01:37:08.590" style="s2">believable and the great demands placed</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.849" end="01:37:11.380" style="s2">on Abraham it&#39;s not as if this just</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.590" end="01:37:12.880" style="s2">comes to him as a gift he has to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.380" end="01:37:14.499" style="s2">willing to sacrifice whatever is</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.880" end="01:37:16.479" style="s2">necessary in order to maintain that</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.499" end="01:37:18.489" style="s2">contract and so that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.479" end="01:37:20.170" style="s2">realistic there&#39;s no reason to assume</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.489" end="01:37:23.079" style="s2">that life isn&#39;t so difficult that it</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.170" end="01:37:24.729" style="s2">actually demands the best from you that</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.079" end="01:37:26.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually structured in that manner</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.729" end="01:37:30.130" style="s2">and that if the you are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.920" end="01:37:32.320" style="s2">reveal the best in you in response to</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.130" end="01:37:34.179" style="s2">the vicissitudes of life that you might</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.320" end="01:37:39.849" style="s2">actually prevail and you might actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.179" end="01:37:43.510" style="s2">set things straight around you and law</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.849" end="01:37:46.840" style="s2">and what if that was true that would be</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.510" end="01:37:50.199" style="s2">a remarkable thing and I can&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.840" end="01:37:52.449" style="s2">it cannot be true and I can&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.199" end="01:37:54.699" style="s2">it&#39;s not stamped on the soul of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.449" end="01:37:57.249" style="s2">who&#39;s conscious I think we all know this</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.699" end="01:38:00.670" style="s2">perfectly well although the stories</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.249" end="01:38:04.539" style="s2">remind us you know Plato Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.670" end="01:38:08.369" style="s2">believed that all knowledge was</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.539" end="01:38:10.989" style="s2">remembering you know he believed that</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.369" end="01:38:14.489" style="s2">the soul before birth had all knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.989" end="01:38:16.840" style="s2">and lost it at birth and then experience</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.489" end="01:38:18.729" style="s2">reminded the soul of what it already</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.840" end="01:38:22.150" style="s2">knew and there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.729" end="01:38:26.949" style="s2">that&#39;s really true because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.150" end="01:38:29.380" style="s2">just a creature that emerged 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.949" end="01:38:31.300" style="s2">ago or 40 years ago you&#39;re you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.380" end="01:38:33.820" style="s2">inheritor of three and a half billion</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.300" end="01:38:36.610" style="s2">years worth of biological engineering</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.820" end="01:38:39.039" style="s2">right you have your nature stamped</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.610" end="01:38:39.670" style="s2">deeply inside of you far more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.039" end="01:38:41.860" style="s2">than we</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.670" end="01:38:43.420" style="s2">any of us realize and when you come</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.860" end="01:38:45.730" style="s2">across these great stories these</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.420" end="01:38:48.310" style="s2">reminders they&#39;re a reminder of how to</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.730" end="01:38:52.140" style="s2">be properly and they echo in your soul</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.310" end="01:38:52.140" style="s2">because the structure is already there</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.920" end="01:38:57.820" style="s2">the external stories are manifestations</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.020" end="01:39:00.100" style="s2">of the internal reality and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.820" end="01:39:08.050" style="s2">a call to that unter internal reality to</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.100" end="01:39:09.880" style="s2">reveal itself well then we come to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.050" end="01:39:12.270" style="s2">end of the Abrahamic stories least this</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.880" end="01:39:14.290" style="s2">section of them with Sarah&#39;s death and</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.270" end="01:39:17.290" style="s2">Abraham is called upon to make the</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.290" end="01:39:18.790" style="s2">supreme sacrifice and interestingly not</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.290" end="01:39:21.160" style="s2">because he&#39;s willing to make the supreme</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.790" end="01:39:24.310" style="s2">sacrifice he actually doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.160" end="01:39:27.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s an interesting thing as well</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.310" end="01:39:28.929" style="s2">because I believe that it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.160" end="01:39:32.020" style="s2">from a psychological perspective to</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.929" end="01:39:38.170" style="s2">point out that the more willing you are</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.020" end="01:39:40.810" style="s2">for example to face death perhaps the</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.170" end="01:39:43.510" style="s2">less likely it is that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.810" end="01:39:48.730" style="s2">have to face it at least in an ignoble</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.510" end="01:39:53.219" style="s2">manner and so with that then we&#39;ll bring</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.730" end="01:39:53.219" style="s2">this 12 part series to a close</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.620" end="01:40:03.490" style="s2">you know I think that applause is for</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.970" end="01:40:07.810" style="s2">everyone and I hate to say that because</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.490" end="01:40:11.080" style="s2">it sounds so new agey ha ha ha but you</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.810" end="01:40:12.850" style="s2">know it really does it really does seem</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.080" end="01:40:15.790" style="s2">to me that this is a participatory</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.850" end="01:40:17.410" style="s2">exercise you know and that and that it</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.790" end="01:40:18.910" style="s2">would not be possible for me to go</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.410" end="01:40:21.310" style="s2">through these stories without having you</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.910" end="01:40:22.900" style="s2">here to listen and so and I always think</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.310" end="01:40:25.660" style="s2">when talking to a crowd that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.900" end="01:40:27.010" style="s2">dialogue you know it&#39;s a dialogue you</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.660" end="01:40:29.800" style="s2">said and you listen and you&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.010" end="01:40:31.810" style="s2">listened and and and thank God for that</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.800" end="01:40:33.490" style="s2">you know and that gives me a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.810" end="01:40:35.200" style="s2">think and it gives me a chance to watch</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.490" end="01:40:37.260" style="s2">and it gives me a chance to interact</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.200" end="01:40:39.820" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re emblematic of of</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.260" end="01:40:41.830" style="s2">humanity at large I suppose that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.820" end="01:40:43.810" style="s2">way of thinking about it and for me to</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.830" end="01:40:46.180" style="s2">be able to craft what I&#39;m saying so that</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.810" end="01:40:48.370" style="s2">it has an impact on all of you here also</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.180" end="01:40:49.720" style="s2">means that I can simultaneously craft it</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.370" end="01:40:51.670" style="s2">so that it has an impact that in</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.720" end="01:40:54.310" style="s2">principle can reach far beyond this</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.670" end="01:40:56.950" style="s2">place and so you know I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.310" end="01:40:58.690" style="s2">I&#39;m really hoping that one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.950" end="01:41:00.490" style="s2">that can start to happen with this at</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.690" end="01:41:02.590" style="s2">least is that we can put our culture</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.490" end="01:41:04.180" style="s2">back on its firm foundation because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.590" end="01:41:06.100" style="s2">something that&#39;s desperately needed and</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.180" end="01:41:08.080" style="s2">in order to do that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.100" end="01:41:10.840" style="s2">understand both the evil and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.080" end="01:41:13.000" style="s2">nobility of the human soul and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.840" end="01:41:15.160" style="s2">like--that&#39;s that&#39;s a fundamental truth</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.000" end="01:41:16.900" style="s2">you know and I don&#39;t think you can get</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.160" end="01:41:18.400" style="s2">to the nobility without a soldier and</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.900" end="01:41:20.440" style="s2">through the evil I really don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.400" end="01:41:23.860" style="s2">that at all it&#39;s no place for the naive</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.440" end="01:41:25.450" style="s2">to go that&#39;s for sure but anyways I</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.860" end="01:41:28.420" style="s2">would like to thank you as you thanked</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.450" end="01:41:30.670" style="s2">me for your close and careful attention</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.420" end="01:41:32.890" style="s2">and your support during all of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.670" end="01:41:36.940" style="s2">been a really a remarkable experience</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.890" end="01:41:42.390" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly sort of developed beyond</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.940" end="01:41:42.390" style="s2">my my dreams so</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.340" end="01:42:07.400" style="s2">on to the questions hi dr. Peterson it</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.150" end="01:42:08.900" style="s2">appears to me from this series and from</p>

<p begin="01:42:55.280" end="01:43:03.050" style="s2">the fool well there isn&#39;t any difference</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.580" end="01:43:04.790" style="s2">between the pool and someone whose</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.050" end="01:43:06.739" style="s2">courageous right from an archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.790" end="01:43:09.080" style="s2">perspective and I mean Abraham is a fool</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.739" end="01:43:11.570" style="s2">obviously when he starts his his</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.080" end="01:43:13.909" style="s2">adventures I mean the story lays it out</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.570" end="01:43:16.159" style="s2">in that manner he&#39;s far too old to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.909" end="01:43:19.219" style="s2">leaving home for example he&#39;s a late</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.159" end="01:43:21.020" style="s2">bloomer you know and and then he has he</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.219" end="01:43:22.730" style="s2">has a lot of catastrophic adventures</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.020" end="01:43:24.800" style="s2">along the way and certainly you could</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.730" end="01:43:26.659" style="s2">imagine that had you encountered him</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.800" end="01:43:28.400" style="s2">when he first encountered the famine in</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.659" end="01:43:31.580" style="s2">the land of strangers when he first went</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.400" end="01:43:34.070" style="s2">out that the idea that he had he had</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.580" end="01:43:37.790" style="s2">followed his misguided intuitions would</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.070" end="01:43:39.860" style="s2">have been self-evident but in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.790" end="01:43:43.790" style="s2">Abrahamic stories there is this call to</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.860" end="01:43:45.260" style="s2">get out and do and that&#39;s it and the</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.790" end="01:43:47.060" style="s2">thing is is that you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.260" end="01:43:48.889" style="s2">things I&#39;ve learned to put it to make it</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.060" end="01:43:50.360" style="s2">concretely is that like I&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.889" end="01:43:52.340" style="s2">of different things in my life and every</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.360" end="01:43:54.920" style="s2">time I did a new thing I was a fool I</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.340" end="01:43:58.370" style="s2">did it badly I was an imposter right and</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.920" end="01:43:59.389" style="s2">and and because I when you first start</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.370" end="01:44:02.090" style="s2">to do something you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.389" end="01:44:03.460" style="s2">you&#39;re doing but that that&#39;s okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.090" end="01:44:04.550" style="s2">an acceptance of your vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.460" end="01:44:06.230" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.550" end="01:44:07.940" style="s2">and your ignorance that&#39;s humility in</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.230" end="01:44:09.410" style="s2">some sense the willingness to be a fool</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.940" end="01:44:11.870" style="s2">in a nude in the land of strangers</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.410" end="01:44:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s it the willingness to be a fool</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.870" end="01:44:16.520" style="s2">in the land of strangers and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.240" end="01:44:18.110" style="s2">act of courage because you also reveal</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.520" end="01:44:20.120" style="s2">your vulnerability to the world by</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.110" end="01:44:21.470" style="s2">stumbling around but as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.120" end="01:44:24.230" style="s2">stumbling forward then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.470" end="01:44:26.780" style="s2">move forward now how do you do that more</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.230" end="01:44:28.700" style="s2">concretely are you aim at an ideal right</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.780" end="01:44:31.160" style="s2">and you aim at an ideal that&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.700" end="01:44:33.170" style="s2">you now maybe you don&#39;t aim to begin</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.160" end="01:44:36.160" style="s2">with it an idea that ideal that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.170" end="01:44:38.570" style="s2">beyond you that you&#39;re crushed by its</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.160" end="01:44:41.930" style="s2">magnificence you know maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.570" end="01:44:44.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s too demotivating to move</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.930" end="01:44:47.060" style="s2">you but you could at least conceptualize</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.270" end="01:44:49.700" style="s2">yourself as the you that you are with</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.060" end="01:44:52.160" style="s2">fewer of the faults that you know of and</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.700" end="01:44:53.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a good start and I also think</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.160" end="01:44:57.650" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.630" end="01:45:00.220" style="s2">humility take stock figure out how it is</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.650" end="01:45:04.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re not who you could be and</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.220" end="01:45:06.890" style="s2">then move in that direction and accept</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.280" end="01:45:09.650" style="s2">the consequences you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.890" end="01:45:11.450" style="s2">going to get slapped a lot but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.650" end="01:45:13.730" style="s2">with each slap you&#39;ll straighten up a</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.450" end="01:45:15.260" style="s2">little bit especially if you listen even</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.730" end="01:45:17.270" style="s2">to the people who are slapping you</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.260" end="01:45:20.750" style="s2">because sometimes they&#39;re the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.270" end="01:45:22.790" style="s2">can reveal for you very quickly where it</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.750" end="01:45:24.110" style="s2">is that you&#39;re weak and insufficient so</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.790" end="01:45:28.520" style="s2">that you won&#39;t have to be that way in</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.110" end="01:45:36.119" style="s2">the future so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.520" end="01:45:40.300" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.119" end="01:45:43.060" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson I have no questions</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.300" end="01:45:44.860" style="s2">for you all I ever wanted to do is just</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.060" end="01:45:47.290" style="s2">stand in front of you and be able to</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.860" end="01:45:50.830" style="s2">thank you for everything you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.290" end="01:46:06.159" style="s2">fine my pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.830" end="01:46:08.679" style="s2">oh good morning citizen Peterson you got</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.159" end="01:46:10.960" style="s2">a short one yeah I do I mean a question</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.679" end="01:46:13.900" style="s2">eight is the best question relax</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.960" end="01:46:14.530" style="s2">trust me this one&#39;s good but first I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.900" end="01:46:17.380" style="s2">break the ice</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.530" end="01:46:19.300" style="s2">now I&#39;m going keyboard up said so state</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.380" end="01:46:20.800" style="s2">now no icebreaker you want me to get</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.300" end="01:46:22.960" style="s2">right into the real question I want you</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.800" end="01:46:26.290" style="s2">to get right into the question all right</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.960" end="01:46:28.570" style="s2">so this question is about hyper critical</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.290" end="01:46:30.159" style="s2">thinking yep now everyone knows the</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.570" end="01:46:33.280" style="s2">critical thinking is a great thing to</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.159" end="01:46:35.830" style="s2">develop you have to be able to cook I</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.280" end="01:46:37.869" style="s2">guess think about your ideas so if</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.830" end="01:46:39.730" style="s2">information is presented do you have to</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.869" end="01:46:43.480" style="s2">decide if it&#39;s legitimate or if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.730" end="01:46:45.969" style="s2">some sort of deceit behind it but when</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.480" end="01:46:48.159" style="s2">it&#39;s taken to its extreme no matter how</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.969" end="01:46:50.290" style="s2">great or noble somebody is you can</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.159" end="01:46:52.989" style="s2">always find a crack in the armor and try</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.290" end="01:46:54.849" style="s2">to figure out how they&#39;re covering up</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.989" end="01:46:56.619" style="s2">something that&#39;s not great about them</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.849" end="01:47:00.010" style="s2">you know and you might then discredit</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.619" end="01:47:01.570" style="s2">everything they do is just a facade okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.010" end="01:47:02.889" style="s2">so let me stop you there for a sec</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.570" end="01:47:05.080" style="s2">because I want to address two of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.889" end="01:47:07.389" style="s2">issues that you already brought up so</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.080" end="01:47:10.210" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the issue of hyper</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.389" end="01:47:11.889" style="s2">critical thinking partly in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.210" end="01:47:14.380" style="s2">to yourself and partly in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.889" end="01:47:16.449" style="s2">to others so I&#39;d like to address the</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.380" end="01:47:19.060" style="s2">issue with regards to yourself to begin</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.449" end="01:47:21.969" style="s2">with so there&#39;s this idea that Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.060" end="01:47:23.920" style="s2">developed um he extracted it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.969" end="01:47:25.480" style="s2">know from where from some ancient</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.920" end="01:47:27.429" style="s2">writings that he was familiar with I</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.480" end="01:47:29.380" style="s2">believe they were Jewish writings he</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.429" end="01:47:32.020" style="s2">said that classically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.380" end="01:47:35.230" style="s2">traditionally speaking God was viewed to</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.020" end="01:47:37.330" style="s2">rule being with two hands the right hand</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.230" end="01:47:40.030" style="s2">and left hand and the right hand was</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.330" end="01:47:42.369" style="s2">justice and that was you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.030" end="01:47:45.489" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to you but the left hand</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.369" end="01:47:46.430" style="s2">was mercy and the idea essentially was</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.489" end="01:47:47.900" style="s2">that the cause</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.430" end="01:47:49.430" style="s2">could not exist without the proper</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.900" end="01:47:51.740" style="s2">combination of justice and mercy</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.430" end="01:47:53.390" style="s2">you should get what&#39;s coming to you but</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.740" end="01:47:56.330" style="s2">people are fallible and they make</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.390" end="01:47:59.060" style="s2">mistakes and so it&#39;s reasonable to apply</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.330" end="01:48:00.260" style="s2">that to yourself you know there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.060" end="01:48:02.570" style="s2">idea that&#39;s being developed by</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.260" end="01:48:05.060" style="s2">psychologists over the last few decades</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.570" end="01:48:07.250" style="s2">that people are basically narcissistic</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.060" end="01:48:08.510" style="s2">and that they generally feel that</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.250" end="01:48:11.390" style="s2">they&#39;re better at most things than other</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.510" end="01:48:13.010" style="s2">people I don&#39;t buy that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.390" end="01:48:14.540" style="s2">the experimental evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.010" end="01:48:16.330" style="s2">very strong and I certainly haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.540" end="01:48:18.230" style="s2">that for example in my clinical practice</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.330" end="01:48:19.970" style="s2">where I&#39;ve seen that people are</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.230" end="01:48:23.570" style="s2">generally far harder on themselves than</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.970" end="01:48:25.070" style="s2">they are on other people one example of</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.570" end="01:48:26.570" style="s2">that I&#39;ve written about this in my new</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.070" end="01:48:28.190" style="s2">book too is that you know if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.570" end="01:48:30.800" style="s2">pet that&#39;s sick and you take it to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.190" end="01:48:32.480" style="s2">vet and you get medication you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.800" end="01:48:34.610" style="s2">likely to give the pet the entire course</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.480" end="01:48:36.890" style="s2">of medication to go to the pharmacy to</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.610" end="01:48:38.870" style="s2">get the prescription filled to give the</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.890" end="01:48:41.600" style="s2">pet the medication to follow it through</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.870" end="01:48:43.460" style="s2">but if you are the person who has the</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.600" end="01:48:46.310" style="s2">problem yeah you all laughed if you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.460" end="01:48:48.170" style="s2">the story it&#39;s like a 30 you won&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.310" end="01:48:50.330" style="s2">go fill the prescription and of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.170" end="01:48:52.610" style="s2">remaining 2/3 of you half of them won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.330" end="01:48:54.440" style="s2">take it to completion and you think well</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.610" end="01:48:57.440" style="s2">why are people like that and I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.440" end="01:48:59.240" style="s2">it&#39;s because they know themselves they</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.440" end="01:49:01.640" style="s2">have contempt for themselves because of</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.240" end="01:49:03.860" style="s2">their flaws and then they come to</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.640" end="01:49:05.810" style="s2">despise themselves and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.860" end="01:49:08.240" style="s2">big mistake that&#39;s Locke that&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.810" end="01:49:10.160" style="s2">justice and not enough mercy and you</p>

<p begin="01:50:30.260" end="01:50:35.899" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good policy but you</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.169" end="01:50:38.479" style="s2">should come to lay out a mode of being</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.899" end="01:50:41.300" style="s2">for yourself that gives you some credit</p>

<p begin="01:56:07.690" end="01:56:14.320" style="s2">the house University and because so many</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.870" end="01:56:18.900" style="s2">students are dropping out especially men</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.320" end="01:56:21.690" style="s2">and especially at I think minorities</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.900" end="01:56:23.860" style="s2">they&#39;ve created this team called the</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.690" end="01:56:27.280" style="s2">Student Success team or something</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.860" end="01:56:30.219" style="s2">Student Success advisors yeah and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.280" end="01:56:35.590" style="s2">been extracting credibly successful</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.219" end="01:56:38.500" style="s2">crowdfunding for your research and on</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.590" end="01:56:40.750" style="s2">your patreon and I think like how much</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.500" end="01:56:44.830" style="s2">does it cost for a single person to do</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.750" end="01:56:46.500" style="s2">the self altering program well it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.830" end="01:56:50.140" style="s2">for one so it&#39;s about fifteen dollars</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.500" end="01:56:52.840" style="s2">okay so okay so nothing then basically</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.140" end="01:56:55.960" style="s2">um but I was thinking that we could</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.840" end="01:56:58.900" style="s2">somehow we could incorporate the self</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.960" end="01:57:03.190" style="s2">authoring program into this into this</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.900" end="01:57:06.219" style="s2">new advisor committee at Dow so that</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.190" end="01:57:08.920" style="s2">students can knock yourself out man do</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.219" end="01:57:10.870" style="s2">it that&#39;s what that&#39;s the other like the</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.920" end="01:57:13.000" style="s2">data for the future authoring program is</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.870" end="01:57:15.400" style="s2">quite clear if students even do it for</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.000" end="01:57:17.050" style="s2">an hour before they go to university</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.400" end="01:57:18.699" style="s2">they have a thirty thirty percent less</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.050" end="01:57:21.640" style="s2">chance of dropping out the first</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.699" end="01:57:23.140" style="s2">semester so you know and it would really</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.640" end="01:57:25.180" style="s2">night be nice to see some student</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.140" end="01:57:27.699" style="s2">organizations that were seriously</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.180" end="01:57:29.320" style="s2">devoted to facilitating student success</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.699" end="01:57:32.260" style="s2">you might think that&#39;s what student</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.320" end="01:57:34.300" style="s2">organizations should do in fact well it</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.260" end="01:57:36.100" style="s2">seems rather self-evident when you think</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.300" end="01:57:37.390" style="s2">about it but you know so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.100" end="01:57:41.560" style="s2">like if you&#39;re oriented in that</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.390" end="01:57:43.840" style="s2">direction get outer so it&#39;s a fine plan</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.560" end="01:57:45.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s I like the emphasis of it</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.840" end="01:57:47.890" style="s2">because you&#39;re directing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.160" end="01:57:50.080" style="s2">towards the facilitation of individual</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.890" end="01:57:52.120" style="s2">accomplishment and you&#39;re at least going</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.080" end="01:57:54.280" style="s2">to do very little harm that way and</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.120" end="01:57:56.739" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good start man you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.280" end="01:57:57.850" style="s2">that&#39;s that because that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.739" end="01:58:00.070" style="s2">you should think about when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.850" end="01:58:02.140" style="s2">setting out to make things better the</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.070" end="01:58:04.300" style="s2">first thing you should think is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.140" end="01:58:06.820" style="s2">so sure I know what I&#39;m doing so why</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.300" end="01:58:09.219" style="s2">don&#39;t I first attempt to do the least</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.820" end="01:58:11.110" style="s2">amount of harm possible and by</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.219" end="01:58:13.750" style="s2">concentrating on helping someone develop</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.110" end="01:58:14.880" style="s2">their own plan and and implement that</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.750" end="01:58:16.599" style="s2">into the future</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.880" end="01:58:19.030" style="s2">encouraging them with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.599" end="01:58:20.830" style="s2">whatever success they would like to find</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.030" end="01:58:22.989" style="s2">their way there&#39;s a pretty low</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.830" end="01:58:25.300" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re going to act the</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.989" end="01:58:28.659" style="s2">terror tyrant and and and play a</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.300" end="01:58:31.090" style="s2">detrimental role so good luck</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.659" end="01:58:32.590" style="s2">maybe we can communicate thank you yes</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.090" end="01:58:38.260" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna send you an email thank you</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.590" end="01:58:40.599" style="s2">very much hi dr. Peterson this is the</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.260" end="01:58:41.770" style="s2">first of these lectures that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.599" end="01:58:44.320" style="s2">here to listen to but I&#39;ve listened to</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.770" end="01:58:45.730" style="s2">all of them on YouTube so far oh boy</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.320" end="01:58:49.659" style="s2">they&#39;re not close enough all right wait</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.730" end="01:58:52.179" style="s2">that&#39;s good okay yeah and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.659" end="01:58:55.570" style="s2">trying to think up this question since</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.179" end="01:58:57.040" style="s2">basically the first lecture because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.570" end="01:59:00.219" style="s2">a seminary student at an evangelical</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.040" end="01:59:01.750" style="s2">seminary and a lot of what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.219" end="01:59:03.849" style="s2">saying has really been resonating and</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.750" end="01:59:07.210" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s really been fascinating to</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.849" end="01:59:08.260" style="s2">listen to and you know there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.210" end="01:59:09.610" style="s2">people who have been asking you</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.260" end="01:59:11.770" style="s2">questions like what do you believe about</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.610" end="01:59:13.300" style="s2">the resurrection do you believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.770" end="01:59:14.409" style="s2">are you a Christian and all these sorts</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.300" end="01:59:15.670" style="s2">of things and you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.409" end="01:59:17.739" style="s2">listening very closely to all your</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.670" end="01:59:19.360" style="s2">answers and have groups of friends on</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.739" end="01:59:21.520" style="s2">Facebook or bowling following very</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.360" end="01:59:23.080" style="s2">closely say or what Peterson said this</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.520" end="01:59:26.830" style="s2">time maybe he&#39;s one of us finally or</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.080" end="01:59:29.770" style="s2">something like that but but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.830" end="01:59:31.989" style="s2">time other ways that you explain some of</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.770" end="01:59:34.239" style="s2">the stories sound very close to what we</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.989" end="01:59:36.219" style="s2">call theological liberalism you know in</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.239" end="01:59:38.500" style="s2">the 19th century the idea that using</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.219" end="01:59:39.639" style="s2">historical critical methods of reading</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.500" end="01:59:41.710" style="s2">and interpreting the Bible and</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.639" end="01:59:43.630" style="s2">understanding Jesus more as a moral</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.710" end="01:59:45.429" style="s2">figure than as a literal historical</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.630" end="01:59:49.179" style="s2">figure and whose atonement provides</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.429" end="01:59:50.469" style="s2">satisfaction for man so I tried to</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.179" end="01:59:52.090" style="s2">figure out what the question was because</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.469" end="01:59:53.800" style="s2">I could interpret what some of your</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.090" end="01:59:56.650" style="s2">answers were so I&#39;m going to put it in</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.800" end="01:59:59.290" style="s2">more of a general way okay where exactly</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.650" end="02:00:01.900" style="s2">do you see yourself differing from</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.290" end="02:00:04.389" style="s2">traditional Orthodox evangelical</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.900" end="02:00:07.570" style="s2">Christianity and and why would you</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.389" end="02:00:08.830" style="s2">differ there given how much you you seem</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.570" end="02:00:10.869" style="s2">to understand the importance of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.830" end="02:00:13.540" style="s2">biblical stories and the Western history</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.869" end="02:00:14.860" style="s2">in Western history okay okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.540" end="02:00:18.699" style="s2">a good that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.860" end="02:00:21.550" style="s2">well I offer obviously I have to answer</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.699" end="02:00:23.230" style="s2">in a general way I mean I think that one</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.550" end="02:00:25.510" style="s2">of the things that makes me different is</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.230" end="02:00:28.060" style="s2">that I take the idea that things are</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.510" end="02:00:30.270" style="s2">fourteen billion years old seriously</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.060" end="02:00:32.770" style="s2">you know and and the idea of evolution</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.270" end="02:00:35.800" style="s2">seriously I mean as Daz does the</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.770" end="02:00:38.230" style="s2">Catholic Church by the way and so but I</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.800" end="02:00:40.540" style="s2">don&#39;t see that as an impediment to the</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.230" end="02:00:42.840" style="s2">pursuit that I&#39;m undertaking now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.540" end="02:00:45.160" style="s2">know how to bridge that gap precisely</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.840" end="02:00:47.260" style="s2">but I&#39;m not that worried about it I mean</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.160" end="02:00:48.790" style="s2">you can&#39;t bridge every gap it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.260" end="02:00:51.280" style="s2">possible it would require infinite</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.790" end="02:00:53.110" style="s2">knowledge okay and how so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.280" end="02:00:55.150" style="s2">one major because I&#39;m coming at this</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.110" end="02:00:56.350" style="s2">from the scientific I really am coming</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.150" end="02:00:58.360" style="s2">at this from the scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.350" end="02:00:59.890" style="s2">you know like I try to make sure that</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.360" end="02:01:01.990" style="s2">everything that I talk about is</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.890" end="02:01:04.030" style="s2">commensurate with current scientific</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.990" end="02:01:05.500" style="s2">knowledge now current scientific</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.030" end="02:01:07.300" style="s2">knowledge no doubt is airing in all</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.500" end="02:01:09.520" style="s2">sorts of ways like I think our notion</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.300" end="02:01:11.980" style="s2">about exactly how evolution progresses</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.520" end="02:01:13.780" style="s2">is flawed in many many ways and the</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.980" end="02:01:15.460" style="s2">recent discoveries in the field of</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.780" end="02:01:16.750" style="s2">epigenetics which show that you can</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.460" end="02:01:18.910" style="s2">actually transmit acquired</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.750" end="02:01:22.300" style="s2">characteristics you know has really put</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.910" end="02:01:24.970" style="s2">a whole real serious stick in the spokes</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.300" end="02:01:29.230" style="s2">of the evolutionary bicycle let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.970" end="02:01:32.050" style="s2">but but then I also think the question</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.230" end="02:01:34.240" style="s2">is miss asked in some sense because I</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.050" end="02:01:36.370" style="s2">gave this lecture series a specific</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.240" end="02:01:38.500" style="s2">title for a specific reason and the</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.370" end="02:01:40.930" style="s2">lecture series is the psychological</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.500" end="02:01:43.870" style="s2">significance of the biblical stories now</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.930" end="02:01:46.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming that my psychological</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.870" end="02:01:49.350" style="s2">analysis exhausts the significance of</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.450" end="02:01:52.450" style="s2">the biblical stories you know they have</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.350" end="02:01:54.730" style="s2">multitudes let&#39;s say layers of meaning</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.450" end="02:01:56.050" style="s2">and some of those layers of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.730" end="02:01:58.510" style="s2">and some of them are more specifically</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.050" end="02:02:00.820" style="s2">religious and I&#39;m trying the best I can</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.510" end="02:02:02.410" style="s2">not to wander into those domains like I</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.820" end="02:02:04.900" style="s2">do because it&#39;s impossible to keep</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.410" end="02:02:07.450" style="s2">yourself bounded you know when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.900" end="02:02:09.700" style="s2">discursive speaker let&#39;s say I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.450" end="02:02:11.410" style="s2">to what I&#39;m trying to do is the sort of</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.700" end="02:02:12.880" style="s2">thing that Jung did essentially is to</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.410" end="02:02:14.440" style="s2">take a look at these old stories and say</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.880" end="02:02:16.780" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s look at this from the</p>

<p begin="02:02:16.780" end="02:02:22.270" style="s2">let&#39;s see what the significance can be</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.720" end="02:02:24.610" style="s2">and not to say that&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.270" end="02:02:26.560" style="s2">significance there is who knows what</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.610" end="02:02:28.270" style="s2">significance there is one thing I have</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.560" end="02:02:30.490" style="s2">learned about the biblical stories is</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.270" end="02:02:33.130" style="s2">that no matter how deep you go into them</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.490" end="02:02:35.650" style="s2">you are not at the bottom and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.130" end="02:02:37.980" style="s2">been very very interesting to me and god</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.650" end="02:02:40.300" style="s2">only knows about the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.980" end="02:02:41.619" style="s2">substructure of reality because human</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.300" end="02:02:44.949" style="s2">beings certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.619" end="02:02:46.360" style="s2">so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to claim that</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.949" end="02:02:47.800" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing is a religious</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.360" end="02:02:50.739" style="s2">interpretation although you know it</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.800" end="02:02:53.080" style="s2">drifts into that direction I want to</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.739" end="02:02:55.510" style="s2">stay within the purview of my expertise</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.080" end="02:02:57.730" style="s2">such as it is and to say well if you</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.510" end="02:03:01.170" style="s2">look at this psychologically here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.730" end="02:03:03.130" style="s2">you can extract as as pragmatically</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.170" end="02:03:04.989" style="s2">existentially and clinically meaningful</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.130" end="02:03:07.179" style="s2">and the rest of it</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.989" end="02:03:11.070" style="s2">well the rest of it has to be left in</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.179" end="02:03:14.739" style="s2">advance and because I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.070" end="02:03:17.469" style="s2">capacity to investigate claims that go</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.739" end="02:03:20.050" style="s2">beyond that that does not mean that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.469" end="02:03:22.449" style="s2">saying that what I&#39;m doing is reducing</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.050" end="02:03:24.130" style="s2">these stories to their psychological</p>

<p begin="02:03:24.130" end="02:03:29.290" style="s2">grand thing I&#39;m not trying to do that</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.199" end="02:03:32.469" style="s2">it&#39;s not reductionistic it&#39;s a take on</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.290" end="02:03:34.270" style="s2">it so people can make up their own minds</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.469" end="02:03:35.500" style="s2">metaphysically and they also have to</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.270" end="02:03:37.449" style="s2">make up their own minds about how</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.500" end="02:03:40.920" style="s2">they&#39;re going to act which is really the</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.449" end="02:03:44.130" style="s2">crucial issue as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.920" end="02:03:44.130" style="s2">you bet</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.159" end="02:03:54.820" style="s2">I I had a question with respect to daddy</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.630" end="02:03:56.679" style="s2">presented I believe two weeks ago sorry</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.820" end="02:03:57.940" style="s2">a question with respect to data even</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.679" end="02:04:01.870" style="s2">presented I believe two lectures ago</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.940" end="02:04:04.330" style="s2">regarding the use of psilocybin in</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.870" end="02:04:06.190" style="s2">treatment of mental illness yes yes so</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.330" end="02:04:08.320" style="s2">subsequently I looked up some of the</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.190" end="02:04:10.570" style="s2">recently published a literature and one</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.320" end="02:04:12.520" style="s2">yeah studies that I found extremely</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.570" end="02:04:14.770" style="s2">striking was one that was published less</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.520" end="02:04:16.480" style="s2">than a year ago in The Lancet which is a</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.770" end="02:04:18.790" style="s2">very high-end yes</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.480" end="02:04:21.580" style="s2">well respected journal yeah and what</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.790" end="02:04:24.850" style="s2">they looked at was efficacy in patients</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.580" end="02:04:27.070" style="s2">with severe treatment-resistant</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.850" end="02:04:30.520" style="s2">depression and what they found is that</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.070" end="02:04:34.000" style="s2">in 11 out of 12 of the patients they</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.520" end="02:04:36.940" style="s2">showed significant remittance following</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.000" end="02:04:39.190" style="s2">it a single dose of the substance up to</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.940" end="02:04:41.469" style="s2">three months following the single dose</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.190" end="02:04:44.409" style="s2">without additional dosing</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.469" end="02:04:47.290" style="s2">so this not only substantiates I suppose</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.409" end="02:04:50.380" style="s2">my own experiences but when you read</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.290" end="02:04:52.090" style="s2">some of the commentary or review</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.380" end="02:04:54.760" style="s2">articles surrounding these types of</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.090" end="02:04:57.310" style="s2">topics not with respects to depression</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.760" end="02:05:01.060" style="s2">but things like post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.310" end="02:05:03.280" style="s2">disorder addiction they&#39;ll unequivocally</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.060" end="02:05:06.969" style="s2">state that these types of results are</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.280" end="02:05:09.580" style="s2">completely unprecedented and the realm</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.969" end="02:05:10.989" style="s2">of psychiatric medicine yes so I was</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.580" end="02:05:13.480" style="s2">wondering - good comment as to whether</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.989" end="02:05:17.260" style="s2">or not that type of this rhetoric is</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.480" end="02:05:19.150" style="s2">overblown and if not do you see these</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.260" end="02:05:22.330" style="s2">being more mainstream in your future or</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.150" end="02:05:24.340" style="s2">suspect they&#39;ll fall victim to something</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.330" end="02:05:27.190" style="s2">along the lines of regulatory capture no</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.340" end="02:05:28.810" style="s2">I don&#39;t well I don&#39;t think they&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.190" end="02:05:30.010" style="s2">statements and I think I know some of</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.810" end="02:05:31.330" style="s2">the people who are engaged in this</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.010" end="02:05:32.980" style="s2">research and they&#39;re actually very</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.330" end="02:05:35.380" style="s2">conservative people like their brave</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.980" end="02:05:36.909" style="s2">people but I mean conservative in the</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.380" end="02:05:38.469" style="s2">best sense you know they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.909" end="02:05:40.239" style="s2">not Timothy Leary yeah and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.469" end="02:05:43.870" style="s2">trying to put down Timothy Leary I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.239" end="02:05:46.150" style="s2">really not but you know some caution</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.870" end="02:05:49.900" style="s2">would have been a good thing although</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.150" end="02:05:51.790" style="s2">you know when something like when the</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.900" end="02:05:53.530" style="s2">psychedelics burst onto the scene no one</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.790" end="02:05:56.139" style="s2">had any idea what to do with them right</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.530" end="02:05:57.730" style="s2">so and we still really don&#39;t but the new</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.139" end="02:05:59.980" style="s2">research is being conducted very very</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.730" end="02:06:01.580" style="s2">carefully but it is really remarkable</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.980" end="02:06:03.740" style="s2">that those episodes</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.580" end="02:06:05.330" style="s2">are used or those terms are used to</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.740" end="02:06:07.100" style="s2">describe the results because those are</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.330" end="02:06:09.110" style="s2">the lancet for example is one of the top</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.100" end="02:06:11.540" style="s2">end medical journals</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.110" end="02:06:13.580" style="s2">you don&#39;t see grand claims in The Lancet</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.540" end="02:06:15.890" style="s2">right scientists don&#39;t write that way</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.580" end="02:06:18.590" style="s2">there they&#39;re trained from the very</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.890" end="02:06:20.090" style="s2">beginning to downplay their results but</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.590" end="02:06:22.030" style="s2">they&#39;re quite struck by the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.090" end="02:06:25.130" style="s2">these effects occur with single doses</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.030" end="02:06:27.530" style="s2">now I think that what we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.130" end="02:06:30.110" style="s2">about psychedelics could fill many many</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.530" end="02:06:32.090" style="s2">many thick volumes and they&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.110" end="02:06:36.350" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely mysterious in their</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.090" end="02:06:38.390" style="s2">function purpose effect consequence all</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.350" end="02:06:40.700" style="s2">of that and I&#39;ve always thought that it</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.390" end="02:06:42.590" style="s2">was really appalling that we stopped</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.700" end="02:06:43.850" style="s2">investigating them back in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.590" end="02:06:46.550" style="s2">although it&#39;s not been that long you</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.850" end="02:06:50.720" style="s2">know 20 years historically speaking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.550" end="02:06:52.490" style="s2">really nothing but and no I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.720" end="02:06:55.130" style="s2">that there&#39;ll be that the research will</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.490" end="02:06:57.380" style="s2">be stopped by regulatory capture because</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.130" end="02:06:59.060" style="s2">the people who are doing it now I think</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.380" end="02:07:01.370" style="s2">learned their lesson from what happened</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.060" end="02:07:04.130" style="s2">in the 60s and are doing it pretty damn</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.370" end="02:07:06.500" style="s2">carefully so we can hope that more</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.130" end="02:07:08.710" style="s2">results like this are produced and that</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.500" end="02:07:15.610" style="s2">they&#39;re replicable and that perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.710" end="02:07:15.610" style="s2">they&#39;ll prove helpful with any luck yep</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.880" end="02:07:25.110" style="s2">hi dr. Pederson I found this lecture</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.980" end="02:07:29.820" style="s2">series really really enthralling and it</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.110" end="02:07:31.170" style="s2">did why no I spent my time to explain</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.820" end="02:07:32.910" style="s2">that I might answer the question</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.170" end="02:07:34.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s okay all I&#39;ll get let you</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.910" end="02:07:38.040" style="s2">get to the question but I&#39;m curious like</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.800" end="02:07:40.110" style="s2">what why do you think that is because</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.040" end="02:07:43.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange thing to have happen like</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.110" end="02:07:45.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a lecture on the Bible for God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.350" end="02:07:47.040" style="s2">sake you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.240" end="02:07:49.530" style="s2">something you&#39;d go to a venture</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.040" end="02:07:51.840" style="s2">capitalist with a business plan for so</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.530" end="02:07:53.850" style="s2">like what what is it about it you think</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.840" end="02:07:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s been that that&#39;s had that effect</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.850" end="02:08:02.430" style="s2">on you</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.280" end="02:08:03.810" style="s2">ha I asked you a question instead look I</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.430" end="02:08:05.220" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to put you on</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.810" end="02:08:06.510" style="s2">the spot if you want to just move to</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.220" end="02:08:07.860" style="s2">your question that&#39;s fine but if you</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.510" end="02:08:13.920" style="s2">have an answer to that I would be very</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.860" end="02:08:20.760" style="s2">interested in doing what it is well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.920" end="02:08:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a thrill to encounter a kind of</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.760" end="02:08:27.030" style="s2">means to a metaphysical system that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.760" end="02:08:29.190" style="s2">persuasive and potent and I&#39;ve hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.030" end="02:08:31.860" style="s2">really experienced that a whole lot in</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.190" end="02:08:34.410" style="s2">my life huh that&#39;s what universities are</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.860" end="02:08:36.000" style="s2">supposed to do for people eh that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.410" end="02:08:37.620" style="s2">universities are supposed to do for</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.000" end="02:08:39.090" style="s2">people they&#39;re not supposed to take</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.620" end="02:08:41.220" style="s2">people who are barely hanging together</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.090" end="02:08:44.010" style="s2">and break them and make them weak</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.220" end="02:08:47.820" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to equate them with the</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.010" end="02:08:50.010" style="s2">heroic the heroic sub structure of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.820" end="02:08:52.560" style="s2">human psyche so that they can move out</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.010" end="02:08:54.750" style="s2">into the world and thrive and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.560" end="02:08:57.160" style="s2">absolute crime that isn&#39;t what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.750" end="02:09:04.380" style="s2">happening so hooray for that</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.160" end="02:09:06.090" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.380" end="02:09:08.670" style="s2">occurred to me that the kind of</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.090" end="02:09:13.830" style="s2">tradition and genre that you are working</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.670" end="02:09:15.060" style="s2">in here is that of this sermon now are</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.830" end="02:09:18.840" style="s2">you comfortable with that categorization</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.060" end="02:09:21.510" style="s2">and why or well see where you go with it</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.840" end="02:09:25.350" style="s2">haha well that&#39;s the essence of my</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.510" end="02:09:27.600" style="s2">question are these sermons and might no</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.350" end="02:09:29.160" style="s2">one demo I don&#39;t know h er I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.600" end="02:09:31.860" style="s2">you know sorry what was the last part</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.160" end="02:09:35.870" style="s2">light one call you a preacher well you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.860" end="02:09:39.420" style="s2">certainly call me one and you know I</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.870" end="02:09:41.100" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a certain overlap and</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.420" end="02:09:42.420" style="s2">the overlap but this is being</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.100" end="02:09:43.650" style="s2">characteristic of my approach to</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.420" end="02:09:45.390" style="s2">education right from the beginning</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.650" end="02:09:48.480" style="s2">because I have some rules about what I</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.390" end="02:09:50.070" style="s2">lecture what about the topics that I</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.480" end="02:09:52.380" style="s2">lecture about and the way that I deal</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.070" end="02:09:53.490" style="s2">with it so the first rule is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.380" end="02:09:56.580" style="s2">want to tell you anything that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.490" end="02:09:58.260" style="s2">useful I&#39;m a pragmatist you know like</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.580" end="02:10:00.900" style="s2">I&#39;m an American pragmatist that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.260" end="02:10:03.030" style="s2">of my philosophical grounding and I</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.900" end="02:10:05.880" style="s2">believe that knowledge is tool like and</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.030" end="02:10:08.430" style="s2">that the proper thing to do is to to</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.880" end="02:10:11.010" style="s2">equip people with the tools to move</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.430" end="02:10:14.490" style="s2">effectively in the world and so I want</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.010" end="02:10:16.560" style="s2">to make sure that if I offer a story or</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.490" end="02:10:18.360" style="s2">a fact for that matter I also say well</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.560" end="02:10:20.580" style="s2">here here&#39;s why you need to know this</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.360" end="02:10:22.800" style="s2">fact it will actually improve your life</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.580" end="02:10:24.330" style="s2">or it&#39;ll stop you from wandering into a</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.800" end="02:10:27.300" style="s2">pit which is approximately the same</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.330" end="02:10:29.220" style="s2">thing and then it will also knowing this</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.300" end="02:10:30.840" style="s2">will also make you more effective actor</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.220" end="02:10:32.640" style="s2">in the social world and that will</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.840" end="02:10:33.780" style="s2">improve the social world right and</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.640" end="02:10:36.480" style="s2">hopefully that will improve the</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.780" end="02:10:39.300" style="s2">environmental world etc etc and so I</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.480" end="02:10:41.190" style="s2">would say to the degree that those who</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.300" end="02:10:43.380" style="s2">produce sermons are concerned with</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.190" end="02:10:46.320" style="s2">producing alterations in behavior which</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.380" end="02:10:48.360" style="s2">is our moral alterations say then I</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.320" end="02:10:49.980" style="s2">share the same territory with them but I</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.360" end="02:10:51.930" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.980" end="02:10:54.000" style="s2">should be only relegated to the domain</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.930" end="02:10:55.650" style="s2">of the sermon because I believe that it</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.000" end="02:10:57.560" style="s2">is the job of the universities for</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.650" end="02:11:01.260" style="s2">example especially in the damned</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.560" end="02:11:03.840" style="s2">humanities to ennoble people and to</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.260" end="02:11:06.270" style="s2">enable them to adopt the mantle of</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.840" end="02:11:08.730" style="s2">proper citizenship and that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.270" end="02:11:11.220" style="s2">forgotten that we&#39;ve forgotten that or</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.730" end="02:11:13.739" style="s2">we&#39;re avoiding it or refusing it or</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.220" end="02:11:15.480" style="s2">something like that you know and I think</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.739" end="02:11:18.750" style="s2">we&#39;re using the death of God as an</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.480" end="02:11:21.030" style="s2">excuse so I think that to the degree</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.750" end="02:11:23.390" style="s2">that I&#39;m a preacher I&#39;m making an error</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.030" end="02:11:25.710" style="s2">you know and also to the degree that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.390" end="02:11:27.780" style="s2">politicized I&#39;m making an error I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.710" end="02:11:30.120" style="s2">wandering out of my proper territory</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.780" end="02:11:32.730" style="s2">when that&#39;s the domain that I&#39;m in but</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.120" end="02:11:36.030" style="s2">when I&#39;m attempting to assemble multiple</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.730" end="02:11:38.010" style="s2">layers of facts towards a practical end</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.030" end="02:11:39.930" style="s2">which is what I&#39;m trying to do and the</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.010" end="02:11:42.450" style="s2">end is the the annulment of the</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.930" end="02:11:44.760" style="s2">individual right that&#39;s my goal then</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.450" end="02:11:46.080" style="s2">then I&#39;m in my proper domain I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.760" end="02:11:48.360" style="s2">to make mistakes you know I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.080" end="02:11:51.390" style="s2">wander out of my territory and I try not</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.360" end="02:11:52.800" style="s2">to do that but you know it&#39;s well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.390" end="02:11:55.739" style="s2">part of being a fool you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.800" end="02:12:04.710" style="s2">make mistakes so yeah thanks very much</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.739" end="02:12:06.180" style="s2">no problem doc thanks for continuing to</p>

<p begin="02:12:10.140" end="02:12:14.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a generalization there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.330" end="02:12:17.210" style="s2">people that seem not to love me yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.880" end="02:12:19.020" style="s2">I can&#39;t blame him really</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.210" end="02:12:21.180" style="s2">anyway yeah I&#39;m going to lead into a</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.020" end="02:12:26.280" style="s2">question here so him in your book maps</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.180" end="02:12:28.850" style="s2">and rare book maps of meaning uh I got</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.280" end="02:12:32.580" style="s2">that quote from Dostoevsky about how</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.850" end="02:12:35.610" style="s2">humankind mankind - given all the cakes</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.580" end="02:12:37.290" style="s2">in the world yet oh my god so yeah if</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.610" end="02:12:39.690" style="s2">you get oh my god is right man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.290" end="02:12:41.580" style="s2">one killer quote that&#39;s from notes from</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.690" end="02:12:43.680" style="s2">the underground eh everyone should read</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.580" end="02:12:45.719" style="s2">that because everyone&#39;s underground and</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.680" end="02:12:48.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a great it&#39;s a great little journey</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.719" end="02:12:51.060" style="s2">through that yeah so it&#39;s basically as</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.780" end="02:12:53.400" style="s2">you give if you have the perfect utopia</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.060" end="02:12:57.719" style="s2">I often use it basically if you have</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.400" end="02:12:59.730" style="s2">your most perfect utopia humans will</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.719" end="02:13:00.960" style="s2">find a way to screw it up yeah it&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.730" end="02:13:02.670" style="s2">out of the way I do at least yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.960" end="02:13:04.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s what we like we like chaos</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.670" end="02:13:06.090" style="s2">and the unknown just talked about this</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.260" end="02:13:08.910" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the thing is is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.090" end="02:13:09.810" style="s2">heroic adventurers right we&#39;re not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.910" end="02:13:11.550" style="s2">not Sybarite</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.810" end="02:13:13.320" style="s2">laying on a beach although when you get</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.550" end="02:13:14.910" style="s2">the opportunity to do that like make</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.320" end="02:13:16.860" style="s2">sure you take it but that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.910" end="02:13:18.900" style="s2">what that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the proper</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.860" end="02:13:20.850" style="s2">calling of the human soul right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.900" end="02:13:23.040" style="s2">out there to conquer chaos and the</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.850" end="02:13:25.020" style="s2">unknown and it&#39;s in that we find meaning</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.040" end="02:13:26.569" style="s2">and that&#39;s better than the utopia that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.020" end="02:13:29.149" style="s2">what Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.569" end="02:13:31.280" style="s2">god bless his soul Dostoyevsky had that</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.149" end="02:13:33.379" style="s2">he was such a genius he had everything</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.280" end="02:13:35.679" style="s2">that was wrong with communism figured</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.379" end="02:13:38.479" style="s2">out even before it started</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.679" end="02:13:40.609" style="s2">amazing really like if you read the</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.479" end="02:13:42.019" style="s2">possessed or the devil&#39;s which I would</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.609" end="02:13:43.309" style="s2">highly recommend although it&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.019" end="02:13:46.429" style="s2">book to get into it takes about a</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.309" end="02:13:47.059" style="s2">hundred pages to really get get it get</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.429" end="02:13:49.879" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.059" end="02:13:53.179" style="s2">but Dostoyevsky talks his main character</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.879" end="02:13:54.979" style="s2">in that novel is a person who&#39;s again a</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.179" end="02:13:56.689" style="s2">very powerful person who&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.979" end="02:13:58.309" style="s2">possessed by what&#39;s essentially the</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.689" end="02:14:00.010" style="s2">communist ideology and he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.309" end="02:14:02.839" style="s2">effective at moving it forward and</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.010" end="02:14:04.459" style="s2">Dostoyevsky lays out brilliantly exactly</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.839" end="02:14:06.319" style="s2">the catastrophic consequences of that</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.459" end="02:14:07.699" style="s2">both personally and socially and he did</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.319" end="02:14:09.499" style="s2">this like thirty years before the</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.699" end="02:14:11.869" style="s2">Russian Revolution it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.499" end="02:14:14.539" style="s2">uncanny I don&#39;t know where the hell that</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.869" end="02:14:17.089" style="s2">guy was from must have been his epilepsy</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.539" end="02:14:20.510" style="s2">you know so yeah I&#39;m glad I got y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.089" end="02:14:22.879" style="s2">excited him keep going here basically I</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.510" end="02:14:24.379" style="s2">used to use that you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.879" end="02:14:25.879" style="s2">late that a lot of that comes from the</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.379" end="02:14:28.969" style="s2">left-wing this utopia we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.879" end="02:14:30.260" style="s2">towards with the universal income and</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.969" end="02:14:32.179" style="s2">the AI and suddenly the whole</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.260" end="02:14:34.819" style="s2">populations can become insanely creative</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.179" end="02:14:36.919" style="s2">and with no incentives but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.819" end="02:14:38.269" style="s2">utopia is not there it&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.919" end="02:14:40.849" style="s2">thing that hasn&#39;t happened yet we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.269" end="02:14:43.069" style="s2">it we&#39;re in it this is the best thing</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.849" end="02:14:44.929" style="s2">ever and like all of humanity the</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.069" end="02:14:47.749" style="s2">Western civilization like oh my god</p>
<p begin="02:14:44.929" end="02:14:50.179" style="s2">putting the material sense I mean oh</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.749" end="02:14:55.819" style="s2">it&#39;s just toilet paper toilet paper it</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.179" end="02:15:02.689" style="s2">just happened anyway that&#39;s so serious</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.819" end="02:15:05.479" style="s2">like so we have this beautiful thing and</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.689" end="02:15:07.579" style="s2">people are trying to take it down at all</p>

<p begin="02:15:36.709" end="02:15:42.600" style="s2">not good they screwed up big-time</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.170" end="02:15:45.120" style="s2">the purpose behind it it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.600" end="02:15:46.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be fought founding</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.120" end="02:15:48.840" style="s2">fathers next anyone who ever contributed</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.920" end="02:15:50.610" style="s2">to anything to Western civilization as</p>

<p begin="02:15:50.610" end="02:15:55.020" style="s2">being done James Madison High School in</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.130" end="02:15:57.360" style="s2">the States it&#39;s getting renamed because</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.020" end="02:16:00.630" style="s2">some girls one of the students felt</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.360" end="02:16:03.120" style="s2">unsafe and so yeah this is a serious</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.630" end="02:16:05.100" style="s2">issue I wanted like I feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.120" end="02:16:07.530" style="s2">really up against the wall now because</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.100" end="02:16:09.870" style="s2">now they found their Nazis man the Nazis</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.530" end="02:16:12.540" style="s2">are flooding the streets now so how do</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.870" end="02:16:25.110" style="s2">we how do we possibly you know kind of</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.540" end="02:16:35.280" style="s2">save our cakes you had to bring it up</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.110" end="02:16:37.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t you well having the right</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.280" end="02:16:39.540" style="s2">degenerated to the identity politics</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.320" end="02:16:41.460" style="s2">does not seem to be a positive solution</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.540" end="02:16:45.210" style="s2">so one of the things I would say is that</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.460" end="02:16:46.801" style="s2">like I understand why the identity</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.210" end="02:16:49.410" style="s2">politics that has been practiced so</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.801" end="02:16:52.770" style="s2">assiduously and so devastatingly by the</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.410" end="02:16:55.350" style="s2">left has been co-opted by the right I</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.770" end="02:16:57.420" style="s2">understand that but then here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.350" end="02:17:01.051" style="s2">would say to the people on the right who</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.420" end="02:17:04.140" style="s2">are playing that game if you play the</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.051" end="02:17:06.720" style="s2">game of your enemies and you win you win</p>
<p begin="02:17:04.140" end="02:17:09.690" style="s2">their game you don&#39;t win</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.720" end="02:17:11.310" style="s2">that&#39;s not victory you just become the</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.690" end="02:17:14.850" style="s2">most successful exponent of their</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.310" end="02:17:18.301" style="s2">pathology how is that a good thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:14.850" end="02:17:20.220" style="s2">a bad thing so what does that leave</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.301" end="02:17:25.350" style="s2">people as although as an alternative</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.220" end="02:17:28.580" style="s2">well I don&#39;t think that the Caucasians</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.350" end="02:17:30.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say should revert to being white I</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.580" end="02:17:33.570" style="s2">think that&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.690" end="02:17:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a dangerous idea and it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.570" end="02:17:40.400" style="s2">fast and I don&#39;t like to see that I</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.440" end="02:17:43.290" style="s2">think the whole group identity thing is</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.400" end="02:17:46.200" style="s2">seriously pathological I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.290" end="02:17:47.790" style="s2">made big mistakes in Canada I understand</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.200" end="02:17:50.490" style="s2">why at least to some degree in that</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.790" end="02:17:51.870" style="s2">respect and that large mistakes are</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.490" end="02:17:53.730" style="s2">being made all over the Western world</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.870" end="02:17:56.640" style="s2">where we&#39;re making you</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.730" end="02:17:57.540" style="s2">group identity the most important thing</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.640" end="02:18:00.990" style="s2">about you</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.540" end="02:18:02.671" style="s2">I think that&#39;s reprehensible I think</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.990" end="02:18:04.680" style="s2">it&#39;s devastating</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.671" end="02:18:06.421" style="s2">I think it&#39;s genocide &#39;el in its</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.680" end="02:18:09.030" style="s2">ultimate expression I think it will</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.421" end="02:18:13.770" style="s2">bring down our civilization if we pursue</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.030" end="02:18:15.360" style="s2">it we shouldn&#39;t be playing that game so</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.770" end="02:18:16.980" style="s2">what&#39;s the alternative you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.360" end="02:18:19.650" style="s2">thought for a long time about a</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.980" end="02:18:22.350" style="s2">political career really forever since I</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.650" end="02:18:25.020" style="s2">was like 12 really for a long time and</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.350" end="02:18:27.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve always decided against it because</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.020" end="02:18:30.600" style="s2">it seemed to me that the proper level of</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.990" end="02:18:32.280" style="s2">analysis with regards to the solution of</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.600" end="02:18:33.961" style="s2">the problem that we&#39;re facing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.280" end="02:18:36.180" style="s2">political and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:18:33.961" end="02:18:37.980" style="s2">mistake when what I&#39;m doing gets</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.180" end="02:18:40.860" style="s2">politicized either by me or others I</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.980" end="02:18:43.110" style="s2">think that the way that you deal with</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.860" end="02:18:45.631" style="s2">this is to put yourself together I</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.110" end="02:18:47.190" style="s2">really believe that is that because I</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.631" end="02:18:48.720" style="s2">think that individual people are far</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.190" end="02:18:50.341" style="s2">more powerful they&#39;re certainly far more</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.720" end="02:18:52.080" style="s2">evil than they&#39;re willing to consider</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.341" end="02:18:56.131" style="s2">but that&#39;s also a sign of their</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.080" end="02:18:59.671" style="s2">unbelievable power so I think that what</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.131" end="02:19:02.310" style="s2">you do is you aim high and put yourself</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.671" end="02:19:04.650" style="s2">together and stay the hell away from the</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.310" end="02:19:06.870" style="s2">ideologues because they&#39;re hiding</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.650" end="02:19:08.730" style="s2">they&#39;re hiding behind a wall they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.870" end="02:19:12.180" style="s2">able to come out and fight on their own</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.730" end="02:19:14.040" style="s2">behalf and so the way forward through</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.180" end="02:19:16.381" style="s2">the ideological mess and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.040" end="02:19:18.841" style="s2">lesson of Western culture is to place</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.381" end="02:19:20.461" style="s2">the individual at the place of paramount</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.841" end="02:19:24.140" style="s2">importance and to make the group</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.461" end="02:19:25.320" style="s2">identity emerge only when necessary and</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.140" end="02:19:28.830" style="s2">secondarily</p>
<p begin="02:19:25.320" end="02:19:30.330" style="s2">if ever and so you can do that you can</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.830" end="02:19:32.190" style="s2">do that now you can do that tomorrow</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.330" end="02:19:34.290" style="s2">like you can put your life together and</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.190" end="02:19:36.510" style="s2">again as I mentioned to the other young</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.290" end="02:19:39.330" style="s2">men who asked the question is you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.510" end="02:19:41.520" style="s2">hurt anyone doing that right you pick up</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.330" end="02:19:44.100" style="s2">your goddamn responsibilities sort</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.520" end="02:19:46.110" style="s2">yourself oke fix up your family right</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.100" end="02:19:47.881" style="s2">and then you can be a force for good in</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.110" end="02:19:50.221" style="s2">the culture and if enough people do that</p>
<p begin="02:19:47.881" end="02:19:52.530" style="s2">the ideological mess will just evaporate</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.221" end="02:19:53.940" style="s2">it&#39;ll just disappear I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.530" end="02:19:56.700" style="s2">way you show people the right path</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.940" end="02:19:59.011" style="s2">forward to is that you say well look um</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.700" end="02:20:00.931" style="s2">we would like we would like it so much</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.011" end="02:20:04.021" style="s2">if you could thrive as an individual</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.931" end="02:20:06.511" style="s2">drop your cult-like affiliation right</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.021" end="02:20:07.561" style="s2">step out of the shadows the demonic</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.511" end="02:20:10.200" style="s2">shadows you</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.561" end="02:20:12.570" style="s2">ideological possession and step forward</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.200" end="02:20:15.211" style="s2">as a fully developed person into the</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.570" end="02:20:18.780" style="s2">light do it by example</p>

<p begin="02:20:18.780" end="02:20:22.251" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me</p>

<p begin="02:23:06.721" end="02:23:12.690" style="s2">not to get resentful I find that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.780" end="02:23:14.280" style="s2">not a rational argument that will get me</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.690" end="02:23:16.171" style="s2">there there&#39;s something else that I</p>

<p begin="02:23:18.900" end="02:23:22.730" style="s2">relation with self-esteem seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.121" end="02:23:26.820" style="s2">that people who think of themselves</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.730" end="02:23:30.030" style="s2">start in a better position in this game</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.820" end="02:23:32.041" style="s2">ok so ok ok great yeah alright so</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.030" end="02:23:34.501" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in that question so the</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.041" end="02:23:36.450" style="s2">first thing is is there&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.501" end="02:23:38.671" style="s2">the measurement of self-esteem and that</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.450" end="02:23:40.891" style="s2">actually matters because self-esteem is</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.671" end="02:23:42.990" style="s2">a psychological concept a scientific</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.891" end="02:23:44.610" style="s2">concept if you like and you have to get</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.990" end="02:23:46.621" style="s2">the measurement right and you can</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.610" end="02:23:48.181" style="s2">predict self-esteem almost perfectly by</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.621" end="02:23:51.570" style="s2">measuring someone&#39;s extraversion</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.181" end="02:23:53.431" style="s2">and subtracting from that their negative</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.570" end="02:23:55.171" style="s2">emotionality or neuroticism so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.431" end="02:23:57.271" style="s2">actually just a combination of big five</p>
<p begin="02:23:55.171" end="02:23:59.610" style="s2">traits and so people who are extroverted</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.271" end="02:24:02.131" style="s2">who feel a lot of positive emotion and</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.610" end="02:24:04.740" style="s2">who are and who don&#39;t feel a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.131" end="02:24:05.480" style="s2">negative emotion score high on scales of</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.740" end="02:24:10.351" style="s2">self-esteem</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.480" end="02:24:13.171" style="s2">ok so conceptually it&#39;s a non-starter</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.351" end="02:24:15.751" style="s2">because you&#39;re not going to move</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.171" end="02:24:17.730" style="s2">people&#39;s levels of neuroticism let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.751" end="02:24:18.480" style="s2">by trying to get them to feel good about</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.730" end="02:24:21.780" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.480" end="02:24:24.541" style="s2">ok now having said that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.780" end="02:24:28.110" style="s2">mean that you shouldn&#39;t encourage people</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.541" end="02:24:30.240" style="s2">right now there&#39;s this psychologist</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.110" end="02:24:32.190" style="s2">named Jerome Kagan who&#39;s quite a great</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.240" end="02:24:34.561" style="s2">psychologist developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.190" end="02:24:38.131" style="s2">I think he&#39;s emeritus at Harvard at the</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.561" end="02:24:41.131" style="s2">at the at the moment he studied temper</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.131" end="02:24:43.110" style="s2">mentally inhibited children you can so</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.131" end="02:24:44.551" style="s2">they&#39;re basically kids who are high in</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.110" end="02:24:47.190" style="s2">neuroticism probably low and</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.551" end="02:24:48.811" style="s2">extraversion and he found that if those</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.190" end="02:24:50.521" style="s2">chilled and you can identify them as</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.811" end="02:24:54.150" style="s2">early as six months right it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.521" end="02:24:56.400" style="s2">inculcated in their temperament he found</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.150" end="02:24:57.510" style="s2">that if you encouraged them in the world</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.400" end="02:24:59.520" style="s2">you could shift</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.510" end="02:25:01.979" style="s2">them into a more stable personality</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.520" end="02:25:04.200" style="s2">configuration and what you basically did</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.979" end="02:25:06.779" style="s2">was when they were manifesting signs of</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.200" end="02:25:09.330" style="s2">distress instead of encouraging them to</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.779" end="02:25:12.210" style="s2">withdraw and retreat which is what they</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.330" end="02:25:14.040" style="s2">might be attempting to do you encourage</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.210" end="02:25:15.330" style="s2">them to go out and explore so for</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.040" end="02:25:16.500" style="s2">example if you have a temper mentally</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.330" end="02:25:18.479" style="s2">inhibited child and you go to a</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.500" end="02:25:20.160" style="s2">playground and there&#39;s kids out there</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.479" end="02:25:23.580" style="s2">like you have an extroverted emotionally</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.160" end="02:25:25.290" style="s2">stable kid three years old as you put</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.580" end="02:25:27.510" style="s2">them on the ground their feet are</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.290" end="02:25:29.399" style="s2">already moving right like a puppy over</p>
<p begin="02:25:27.510" end="02:25:31.740" style="s2">water and you let them go and they just</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.399" end="02:25:33.569" style="s2">run to the to the kids and they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.740" end="02:25:34.920" style="s2">and then you have to drag them away but</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.569" end="02:25:36.270" style="s2">if you have a temper mentally inhibited</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.920" end="02:25:37.859" style="s2">child the child will sort of stand</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.270" end="02:25:41.729" style="s2">around your legs and sort of peek out</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.859" end="02:25:44.520" style="s2">you know and then what you do is wait it</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.729" end="02:25:46.500" style="s2">out let them watch encourage them to</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.520" end="02:25:48.240" style="s2">move a little bit forward encourage them</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.500" end="02:25:51.689" style="s2">to take their steps out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.240" end="02:25:53.430" style="s2">and the strange land and don&#39;t let them</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.689" end="02:25:55.080" style="s2">withdraw like you can do it you have</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.430" end="02:25:56.850" style="s2">they&#39;re slower to warm up they&#39;ll warm</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.080" end="02:25:59.340" style="s2">up they&#39;ll habituate and if you</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.850" end="02:26:02.520" style="s2">continually expose your inhibited child</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.340" end="02:26:04.680" style="s2">to the things that make them anxious in</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.520" end="02:26:06.479" style="s2">measured doses then you can transform</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.680" end="02:26:08.100" style="s2">their psychophysiological temperament</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.479" end="02:26:09.720" style="s2">now you&#39;re probably not going to shift</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.100" end="02:26:12.420" style="s2">them way the hell out onto the</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.720" end="02:26:13.979" style="s2">extroverted emotionally stable end but</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.420" end="02:26:15.750" style="s2">you can make a big difference that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.979" end="02:26:18.439" style="s2">very different than making them feel</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.750" end="02:26:21.660" style="s2">good about themselves which is such a</p>
<p begin="02:26:18.439" end="02:26:25.590" style="s2">you need to curse you need to curse when</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.660" end="02:26:27.660" style="s2">you discuss that concept right so it</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.590" end="02:26:29.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t the improved their self-esteem it</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.660" end="02:26:32.010" style="s2">isn&#39;t how you feel about yourself right</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.640" end="02:26:33.450" style="s2">it&#39;s how you act effectively in the</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.010" end="02:26:36.600" style="s2">world and how you&#39;re trained to do that</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.450" end="02:26:38.819" style="s2">so okay now then you were talking about</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.600" end="02:26:40.380" style="s2">negotiation right and you said well</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.819" end="02:26:41.609" style="s2">don&#39;t you said something like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:40.380" end="02:26:44.040" style="s2">people who feel good about themselves</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.609" end="02:26:46.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t they able to negotiate better and</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.040" end="02:26:50.189" style="s2">it&#39;s I know that&#39;s a poor paraphrase</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.470" end="02:26:52.680" style="s2">excuse me but negotiation is actually a</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.189" end="02:26:54.029" style="s2">practical issue to some degree like the</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.680" end="02:26:55.830" style="s2">first thing is that you have to figure</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.029" end="02:26:57.300" style="s2">out what you want because you were</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.830" end="02:26:58.950" style="s2">saying well it&#39;s not merely rational</p>
<p begin="02:26:57.300" end="02:27:00.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yeah that&#39;s for sure you</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.950" end="02:27:03.630" style="s2">have to bargain from a position of</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.420" end="02:27:05.310" style="s2">authority let&#39;s say not power Authority</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.630" end="02:27:06.660" style="s2">is a better word but you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.310" end="02:27:08.250" style="s2">authority unless you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:06.660" end="02:27:11.440" style="s2">talking about and unless you can bring</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.250" end="02:27:13.480" style="s2">some unless you can bring some</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.440" end="02:27:17.291" style="s2">let&#39;s say force it&#39;s not that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.480" end="02:27:20.741" style="s2">right word you can negotiate without</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.291" end="02:27:22.061" style="s2">anyone unless you can say no and you</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.741" end="02:27:24.611" style="s2">can&#39;t say no unless you&#39;ve set yourself</p>
<p begin="02:27:22.061" end="02:27:26.351" style="s2">up with alternatives so when you go to</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.611" end="02:27:28.511" style="s2">your boss and you negotiate for a raise</p>
<p begin="02:27:26.351" end="02:27:30.431" style="s2">you need to have the sort of CV that</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.511" end="02:27:32.351" style="s2">enables you to go find another job and</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.431" end="02:27:33.821" style="s2">you have to have your CV prepared and</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.351" end="02:27:35.891" style="s2">you have to have looked for another job</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.821" end="02:27:38.281" style="s2">and you have to be able to get one</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.891" end="02:27:41.021" style="s2">because then you can go in there and say</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.281" end="02:27:43.391" style="s2">I&#39;m not as productive as I could be at</p>

<p begin="02:27:55.841" end="02:27:59.051" style="s2">you hold yourself while you&#39;re having</p>

<p begin="02:28:20.921" end="02:28:24.400" style="s2">say because what are they going to do</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.181" end="02:28:26.801" style="s2">just like sprinkle the money around you</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.400" end="02:28:29.650" style="s2">need to be able to say okay then there</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.801" end="02:28:31.900" style="s2">will be consequences that you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.650" end="02:28:34.781" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it means to say no to</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.900" end="02:28:36.821" style="s2">someone no means if you continue to push</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.781" end="02:28:38.891" style="s2">this things will happen that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.821" end="02:28:41.171" style="s2">like now in that case it&#39;ll be all be</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.891" end="02:28:42.581" style="s2">part and take my talents with me and if</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.171" end="02:28:43.751" style="s2">they don&#39;t care well then you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.581" end="02:28:46.391" style="s2">wrong business or you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.751" end="02:28:49.391" style="s2">talents to begin with right which is so</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.391" end="02:28:50.801" style="s2">it in order to negotiate properly and</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.391" end="02:28:52.721" style="s2">then this is more difficult for people</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.801" end="02:28:54.041" style="s2">who are agreeable for example because</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.721" end="02:28:56.431" style="s2">there tend to be more conflict averse</p>
<p begin="02:28:54.041" end="02:29:00.581" style="s2">you have to put yourself in a position</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.431" end="02:29:02.531" style="s2">where you can you can push back as hard</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.581" end="02:29:04.361" style="s2">as you&#39;re going to be pushed on and that</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.531" end="02:29:06.190" style="s2">means you have to open your you have to</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.361" end="02:29:09.121" style="s2">open up your space of available options</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.190" end="02:29:12.400" style="s2">because otherwise the person says no one</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.121" end="02:29:14.621" style="s2">that&#39;s it you&#39;re done well you&#39;ll lose</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.400" end="02:29:18.101" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s as straightforward as</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.621" end="02:29:21.341" style="s2">that now with regards to the self-esteem</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.101" end="02:29:22.841" style="s2">part is practice on small things because</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.341" end="02:29:24.071" style="s2">you build the skills forget about the</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.841" end="02:29:25.181" style="s2">self-esteem it isn&#39;t about being</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.071" end="02:29:26.681" style="s2">confident or feeling</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.181" end="02:29:28.051" style="s2">confidence or any of that it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.681" end="02:29:31.391" style="s2">knowing bloody well how to negotiate</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.051" end="02:29:32.801" style="s2">start with small things you know so</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.391" end="02:29:34.301" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that there are things in</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.801" end="02:29:36.101" style="s2">your relationships in particular that</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.301" end="02:29:37.990" style="s2">aren&#39;t the way you want them to be and</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.101" end="02:29:39.971" style="s2">that you could see how could be improved</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.990" end="02:29:41.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like figure out how they can be</p>

<p begin="02:29:45.221" end="02:29:48.641" style="s2">at it and then you&#39;ll be able to go out</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.051" end="02:29:52.480" style="s2">and have a harder negotiation in the</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.641" end="02:29:53.831" style="s2">world so to set a skills there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.480" end="02:29:56.190" style="s2">attitude behind it you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.831" end="02:30:00.190" style="s2">easier for some people than others but</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.190" end="02:30:07.780" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s a set of skills no</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.190" end="02:30:12.011" style="s2">problem alright so now we have something</p>
