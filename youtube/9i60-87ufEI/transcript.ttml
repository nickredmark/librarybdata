<p begin="00:00:58.550" end="00:01:03.290" style="s2">he also uses rational mind to make that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.860" end="00:01:05.509" style="s2">more effective and also we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.290" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">look about if you&#39;re competing with</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:46.280" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about well we&#39;ll do our</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.369" end="00:01:48.530" style="s2">best and you know what would it take to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.280" end="00:01:50.450" style="s2">couple all those things in depth as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.530" end="00:01:51.799" style="s2">said earlier we&#39;re gonna take people</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.450" end="00:01:53.479" style="s2">from the shallow end of the swing Paul</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.799" end="00:01:54.650" style="s2">we we are gonna go down to the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.479" end="00:01:56.630" style="s2">into the swimming pool we&#39;re gonna hope</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.650" end="00:01:58.220" style="s2">that none of the listeners drown at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.630" end="00:02:00.979" style="s2">deeper end but you know there are some</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.220" end="00:02:03.799" style="s2">show no lifeboat belts there to save</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.979" end="00:02:06.229" style="s2">them if they you know get a little lost</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.799" end="00:02:07.509" style="s2">but I like to take people deep so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.229" end="00:02:11.810" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.509" end="00:02:14.269" style="s2">great fun so you have some really</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.810" end="00:02:17.180" style="s2">creative ideas but how on earth do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.269" end="00:02:22.070" style="s2">come up with these amazing concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">you you have um you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.070" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">notions like of being able to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.900" end="00:02:30.050" style="s2">the intuitive method and the analytical</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">and irrational method and I use both as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.050" end="00:02:35.249" style="s2">I mentioned to you earlier</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:37.769" style="s2">I was I was raised and trained in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.249" end="00:02:40.549" style="s2">analytical and math mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.769" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">rational method but I&#39;m fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.549" end="00:02:45.659" style="s2">intuitive and it&#39;s only been in the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">decade or so that I&#39;ve really been able</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.659" end="00:02:51.719" style="s2">to hone and honor the intuitive channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.879" style="s2">and so what is it happening for me is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.719" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a constant back-and-forth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.879" end="00:02:59.669" style="s2">trying to figure out different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">techniques to allow the intuitive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.669" end="00:03:06.689" style="s2">speak to be heard to emerge the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">it does as you know it it&#39;s not a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.689" end="00:03:10.409" style="s2">never obvious is never straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:12.359" style="s2">but then when it does to really be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.409" end="00:03:14.129" style="s2">to sort of feel into what it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.359" end="00:03:16.079" style="s2">happening and then what I do is I close</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.129" end="00:03:18.389" style="s2">it with the set of principles and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.079" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">concepts that I am constantly gathering</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.389" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">and refining through the rational</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:25.409" style="s2">Channel and I should mention by the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:28.489" style="s2">this notion of principles and concepts I</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.409" end="00:03:32.219" style="s2">think is particularly useful because</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.489" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">principle is at a high enough level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.219" end="00:03:36.449" style="s2">generality that you can then use it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">make sense of something that is coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.449" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">from the intuitive Channel I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:41.909" style="s2">maybe we can talk about that and work on</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.079" end="00:03:44.189" style="s2">chr√©tien a little bit but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.909" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">how I do it and I find by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.189" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">one of the best ways for media to suss</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:50.370" style="s2">out the things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">intuitively is in dialogue that just</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.370" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">having a conversation with somebody or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:04:01.009" style="s2">just begin to bring things up and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:03.659" style="s2">will surface it&#39;s almost a synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.009" end="00:04:05.009" style="s2">serendipity in the dialogue and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.659" end="00:04:06.569" style="s2">like okay there it is that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.009" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">that it was us trying to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.569" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">it just somehow sharing in words with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.669" end="00:04:13.349" style="s2">another consciousness helps clarify this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:15.569" style="s2">later so that might be talking with</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.349" end="00:04:17.009" style="s2">another business friend about the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.569" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">you&#39;re getting from intuition it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.009" end="00:04:20.549" style="s2">be writing it down in an article and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">sharing it out with people could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.549" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">making a video and sharing it many</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:26.550" style="s2">different ways to yet share and get</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:28.620" style="s2">feedback and get greater clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">just by the act of having to share</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.620" end="00:04:34.099" style="s2">what&#39;s come to you I think for me it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">helps clarify the ideas in my own head</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.099" end="00:04:38.490" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s exactly right and it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">you&#39;re right even creating a video with</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.490" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">the intention of sharing it like if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:43.409" style="s2">create a video without the intention of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:44.969" style="s2">sharing it I don&#39;t think it works but if</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.409" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t actually get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.969" end="00:04:48.020" style="s2">broadly shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:51.670" style="s2">very little feedback the intention of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.020" end="00:04:54.050" style="s2">sharing it just requires a level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.670" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">demeanor and attitude and a level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.050" end="00:04:57.860" style="s2">discipline that helps clarify this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:00.700" style="s2">there&#39;s more subtle element so this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.860" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">both a practical strategy but it also</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.700" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">comes back to you know we want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:07.760" style="s2">these messages and we get from our</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:09.350" style="s2">intuition to improve our business and by</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.760" end="00:05:10.850" style="s2">taking action you know whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.350" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">going to have a conversation or making a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.850" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">video or whatever it somehow makes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.760" end="00:05:17.780" style="s2">intuition pay attention more and give us</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:20.540" style="s2">even more information whereas if we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.780" end="00:05:22.820" style="s2">nothing and just sit on it it seems the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.540" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">intuition almost shuts down and stops</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.820" end="00:05:27.650" style="s2">giving us the information so much yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely right you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.650" end="00:05:30.700" style="s2">just extend that that you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.090" end="00:05:35.290" style="s2">case of this article that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.700" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">you also get the benefit of the larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.290" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">collective intuition or the act of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">feelings of a lot of other people can</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:45.200" style="s2">then actually help point you in areas</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.860" end="00:05:46.760" style="s2">where your intuition may be screaming at</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.200" end="00:05:48.410" style="s2">you but you then get the signal back so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.760" end="00:05:51.710" style="s2">I when I wrote this article I had no</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.410" end="00:05:53.510" style="s2">sense or intent of more than a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.710" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">hundred people reading it maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">thousand at the outside but instead it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2">it went viral a hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">or more have read it and as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:05.420" style="s2">consequence one that told me that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:07.790" style="s2">was something there there was more</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.420" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">intense than I had anticipated but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.790" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">then floated a lot more energy attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">back at me which changes the state of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:19.580" style="s2">what I can do in the world I love that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:21.800" style="s2">and you mentioned someone miss Roy bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:24.440" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite hang on a first name who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.800" end="00:06:26.840" style="s2">talked about what reality really is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.440" end="00:06:28.670" style="s2">how this implies you&#39;re sharing new</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.840" end="00:06:30.290" style="s2">ideas we get from our intuition can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:33.650" style="s2">tell us a little about that and what</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.290" end="00:06:37.180" style="s2">that concept is sure so her name is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.650" end="00:06:39.800" style="s2">Benita like little Bunney Benita Roy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.180" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">she has been thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:43.850" style="s2">metaphysical questions very powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:47.150" style="s2">a while and the way she described it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.850" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">me is that it is better to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.150" end="00:06:52.790" style="s2">reality as a continuum from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:54.920" style="s2">infinitesimal be really really not very</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.790" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">much real all the way to the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.920" end="00:06:59.990" style="s2">that which is quite significantly real</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">and the continuum is measured by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.990" end="00:07:04.699" style="s2">degree to which something is shared so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.550" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">in your own sense they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.699" end="00:07:08.569" style="s2">things that you will intuitively feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">that they&#39;re very vague and very distant</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.569" end="00:07:12.469" style="s2">and you could just barely even hold on</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.779" style="s2">to them for a few moments and so those</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.469" end="00:07:16.939" style="s2">are things that are not very real in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.779" end="00:07:19.129" style="s2">act of gestures to give the tune more</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.939" end="00:07:20.990" style="s2">clearly into them and and kind of play</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.129" end="00:07:22.939" style="s2">with them and start to sort of get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.990" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">better sense of what is trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.939" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">itself that is an internal intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">process of realizing that which is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:31.669" style="s2">a literally making it more real and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:33.500" style="s2">what ends up happening is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.669" end="00:07:35.180" style="s2">build techniques to be able to share</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.500" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">that more broadly the moment where you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.180" end="00:07:38.810" style="s2">can share it outside of yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.729" style="s2">another consciousness that&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.810" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">increase and the realization of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.729" end="00:07:43.939" style="s2">thing and then if it becomes shared even</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:45.949" style="s2">more broadly like say in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.939" end="00:07:47.779" style="s2">this article work some hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.949" end="00:07:51.379" style="s2">consciousnesses are now beginning to act</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.779" end="00:07:52.520" style="s2">on it as a significant realization of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.379" end="00:07:55.509" style="s2">and then you can go further and further</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.520" end="00:07:57.770" style="s2">and further now that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.509" end="00:08:00.919" style="s2">philosophically but let&#39;s deploy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.770" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">business if you&#39;ve got a marketing idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.919" end="00:08:06.379" style="s2">or product or service and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.120" style="s2">positioning in a certain way if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.379" end="00:08:11.719" style="s2">the only person in the world who gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.120" end="00:08:13.879" style="s2">your product no one&#39;s gonna buy it but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.719" end="00:08:15.770" style="s2">if you can get thousands or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.879" end="00:08:18.199" style="s2">thousands of people to get the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.770" end="00:08:20.419" style="s2">like why is an iPhone the thing to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.199" end="00:08:23.479" style="s2">right because my phone&#39;s just a phone</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.419" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">and a computer right but really has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.479" end="00:08:27.979" style="s2">whole bunch of belief systems about why</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:30.409" style="s2">you should get an iPhone and not an</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.979" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">Android that get people to take action</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.409" end="00:08:35.659" style="s2">and that changes the reality so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">just Steve Jobs thinking oh yeah iPhones</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.659" end="00:08:40.190" style="s2">are cool he&#39;s managed to convince</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:42.949" style="s2">millions of people iPhones are cool</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.190" end="00:08:47.570" style="s2">they&#39;re useful I&#39;ve got to have one and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.949" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">that is a genius trick to pull a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.570" end="00:08:52.430" style="s2">reality makes profits and what I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:53.690" style="s2">to do is actually take advantage of one</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.430" end="00:08:55.070" style="s2">of the other topics we want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.690" end="00:08:58.100" style="s2">about which is the nature of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">kinds of Technology frameworks and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.100" end="00:09:02.269" style="s2">then the notion of mean and do them all</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:06.140" style="s2">at once because you may meant we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.269" end="00:09:09.170" style="s2">mean that spell em e/m it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.140" end="00:09:11.209" style="s2">gene and this is critical for modern</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.170" end="00:09:12.639" style="s2">business so tell us what a meme is and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.209" end="00:09:15.740" style="s2">why it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.639" end="00:09:19.699" style="s2">okay so a meme is conventionally thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.740" end="00:09:21.889" style="s2">of as being an idea or an artifact</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.699" end="00:09:25.250" style="s2">actually very specifically call it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.889" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">piece a shareable piece of culture so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.250" end="00:09:32.569" style="s2">might be a song it might be a image it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:34.009" style="s2">might be a you know so just an animated</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.569" end="00:09:38.180" style="s2">joke but it&#39;s a shareable piece of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.009" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">culture is a mean by the way a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.180" end="00:09:41.779" style="s2">named Richard Dawkins the person</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">actually conceptualized the idea and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.779" end="00:09:46.699" style="s2">was trying to specifically talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:51.410" style="s2">would it be the intellectual or idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.699" end="00:09:55.819" style="s2">equivalent of of Jean ideas having sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.410" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">or memes so basically it&#39;s an idea in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.819" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">someone&#39;s head or a thought in someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">head that then gets replicated to other</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:04.130" style="s2">people&#39;s heads so it might be a popular</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:05.569" style="s2">song that they&#39;re singing and then it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.130" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">goes in your head and you keep singing</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.569" end="00:10:09.589" style="s2">and sing it and you share it with other</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.690" style="s2">people or it might be the mean the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.589" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">iPhones are cool and you need to get one</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.690" end="00:10:18.170" style="s2">or it might be them it may be the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:19.699" style="s2">way that somebody holds a cigarette in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.170" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">their hand and sucks in the smoke and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.699" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">blows it out and it might be a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:26.990" style="s2">artifact in the shape of behavior or it</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:28.730" style="s2">might be a particular color of car that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.990" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">is cool this year and so it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.730" end="00:10:32.329" style="s2">actually a little bit more abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:36.380" style="s2">just it can be expressed semantically it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.329" end="00:10:38.300" style="s2">is the stuff that we humans observe in</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.380" end="00:10:40.910" style="s2">our environment that we then use to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.300" end="00:10:43.810" style="s2">change our behavior in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.910" end="00:10:48.550" style="s2">other humans including ourselves so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.810" end="00:10:51.259" style="s2">if we think of humans as as having these</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.550" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">things in their heads that cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.259" end="00:10:54.500" style="s2">behave differently and let&#39;s call that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">software just for the purpose of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.500" end="00:10:58.339" style="s2">the memes are kind of like the pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:01.220" style="s2">the software that get passed around</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.339" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">between the humans and causing them to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.220" end="00:11:08.180" style="s2">behave differently and why is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:11.029" style="s2">important in business well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.180" end="00:11:12.740" style="s2">the way of thinking about means and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.029" end="00:11:15.769" style="s2">being able to have access to the frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.740" end="00:11:18.920" style="s2">of shareability and genetics is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.769" end="00:11:21.529" style="s2">particularly helpful right now because</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.529" end="00:11:25.310" style="s2">what I mean by that is if you think the</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">it word-of-mouth a sort of a cardboard</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.390" end="00:12:42.620" style="s2">way of talking about what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:44.870" style="s2">about right but marketing move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.620" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">word-of-mouth you know now we have all</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.870" end="00:12:49.790" style="s2">kinds of you know different</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">advertisements different copy you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.790" end="00:12:56.930" style="s2">content marketing press you know PR</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:13:00.740" style="s2">manipulation yeah you know the dark arts</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.930" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">of copywriting but this memetics is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.740" end="00:13:06.460" style="s2">an actual scientific theory of why this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">works and how it works is that right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.460" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">that&#39;s correct so it combined so for</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">example the dark arts and popular</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">writing you can either get there through</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.820" style="s2">trial and error or you could just learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:17.930" style="s2">it through the sheer practicality of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.820" end="00:13:20.930" style="s2">trying to see what works and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.930" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work or you can tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.930" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">various disciplines of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:28.580" style="s2">psychology neuroscience human motivation</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.990" style="s2">and understand why those things work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.580" end="00:13:32.779" style="s2">of course if you can jump to the end and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.990" end="00:13:36.080" style="s2">get a much firmer grasp on why certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.779" end="00:13:37.310" style="s2">kinds of ideas are grasped and shared</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.080" end="00:13:38.600" style="s2">with certain kinds of energy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.310" end="00:13:40.370" style="s2">motivation then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.600" end="00:13:43.910" style="s2">are able to delete way ahead of the game</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.370" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">so that lets you you know I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.910" end="00:13:47.990" style="s2">all experienced this sometimes we we</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.880" style="s2">want to get our product out into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.990" end="00:13:51.529" style="s2">market and there&#39;s traction and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.880" end="00:13:53.300" style="s2">wants to share it and use it and other</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.529" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">times it seems like we&#39;re we&#39;re pushing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.300" end="00:13:57.050" style="s2">a noodle from the wrong direction and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:14:02.290" style="s2">nothing&#39;s happening and this helps</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.050" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">explain the difference indeed yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.290" end="00:14:08.810" style="s2">you know what are the key ideas one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">the key motifs is the world wants to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.810" end="00:14:12.259" style="s2">hear what the world wants to hear and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:14.660" style="s2">that&#39;s going to change based upon the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.259" end="00:14:17.089" style="s2">state of the world so for example if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.660" end="00:14:18.170" style="s2">have written my article a year ago I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.089" end="00:14:22.459" style="s2">probably would have gotten about a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.170" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">thousand people to read it but in as of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.459" end="00:14:28.279" style="s2">November 2016 this particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">idea and this particular framing of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.279" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">idea so both the way it&#39;s being told and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">the thing that it&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">suddenly has a whole lot of attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:37.630" style="s2">that&#39;s ready to interact with it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.990" end="00:14:40.850" style="s2">that of course is crucial timing matters</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.630" end="00:14:42.050" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how many times and how many</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.850" end="00:14:44.180" style="s2">different kinds of businesses you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.050" end="00:14:45.620" style="s2">been involved in but the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.180" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">timing matters is actually again with</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.620" end="00:14:50.269" style="s2">more and more and more because our</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">ability to force the universe force the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.269" end="00:14:55.459" style="s2">world to listen to it is decreasing so</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:14:57.470" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s that&#39;s coming back</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.459" end="00:15:01.610" style="s2">to that phrase the zeitgeist you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.470" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in society and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.610" end="00:15:05.750" style="s2">what is the right time and how can you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:10.339" style="s2">tell what the right time is does</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.750" end="00:15:11.870" style="s2">intuition help with that at all well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.339" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">think import in fact the intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.870" end="00:15:14.779" style="s2">the only thing can occur really help</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:16.699" style="s2">because quite often the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.779" end="00:15:18.769" style="s2">change in the zeitgeist just things we</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.699" end="00:15:20.420" style="s2">can&#39;t actually make any sense of and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.769" end="00:15:22.660" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that the idea of the tide</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.420" end="00:15:25.009" style="s2">catcher there were the guys part of site</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.660" end="00:15:28.699" style="s2">descent happening in a level where our</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.009" end="00:15:30.139" style="s2">conscious semantic rational mind by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.699" end="00:15:30.759" style="s2">time we&#39;ve made sense but it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.139" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.759" end="00:15:36.050" style="s2">and I&#39;ll kind of give you an example I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:40.430" style="s2">actually had a business was a public</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.050" end="00:15:41.990" style="s2">company in 2006-2007 timeframe and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.430" end="00:15:43.670" style="s2">began to notice a number of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.990" end="00:15:46.850" style="s2">conversations happening among people in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.670" end="00:15:48.050" style="s2">the financial role bankers that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.850" end="00:15:49.760" style="s2">troubling but I didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.050" end="00:15:51.529" style="s2">expertise might caught my rational mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.760" end="00:15:53.449" style="s2">and understand finance and understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.529" end="00:15:55.509" style="s2">languages like inverted yield curve but</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.449" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">they were using but my intuitive mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.509" end="00:16:01.129" style="s2">and my body were noticing that they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">very nervous and if I had been able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.129" end="00:16:03.769" style="s2">be more effectively tuned into that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">they&#39;ve started being able to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.769" end="00:16:08.449" style="s2">something clearly important is happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:10.279" style="s2">here what might that impact might that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.449" end="00:16:12.499" style="s2">have in my business I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.279" end="00:16:13.970" style="s2">able to be more effectively prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.499" end="00:16:15.559" style="s2">the financial crisis that they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.970" end="00:16:17.569" style="s2">aware of or at least David themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.559" end="00:16:19.699" style="s2">intuitively aware of which of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.569" end="00:16:21.079" style="s2">made a massive difference in my business</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.699" end="00:16:23.569" style="s2">and everybody else&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.079" end="00:16:26.360" style="s2">oh yeah I mean fortunes were made and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.569" end="00:16:30.139" style="s2">lost in that crisis so if you were able</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.360" end="00:16:32.389" style="s2">to pick a timing on that you&#39;d have done</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.139" end="00:16:33.230" style="s2">great or protected yourself and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.389" end="00:16:36.199" style="s2">get wipeout</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.230" end="00:16:38.209" style="s2">and that he is it&#39;s in the is in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.199" end="00:16:39.319" style="s2">water in the air you&#39;ll be tuning into</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.209" end="00:16:42.230" style="s2">it it&#39;s the intuitive but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.319" end="00:16:45.139" style="s2">happening right now everybody is feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.230" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">like something is going on but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.139" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">name it yet and so the process of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">able to allow those feelings to point</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:54.980" style="s2">you at least you&#39;ll give you just allow</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">yourself to allocate your attention to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.980" end="00:16:59.329" style="s2">the things your intuitions are pointing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:01.370" style="s2">yourself towards and not try to hold too</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.329" end="00:17:03.019" style="s2">tightly because the thing that holds</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.370" end="00:17:06.949" style="s2">tightly is the thing that&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.019" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">obsolete I love that if you&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.949" end="00:17:11.089" style="s2">on too tightly to some business model or</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.409" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">way of doing things or you&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.089" end="00:17:15.350" style="s2">making money through print ads in</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:17.959" style="s2">newspapers and then social media comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.350" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">along and you don&#39;t do anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.959" end="00:17:22.579" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have problems in your</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.530" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.660" end="00:18:55.270" style="s2">in my experience shocking uncommon the</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.130" end="00:18:59.410" style="s2">them that makes me sense I think is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.210" end="00:19:00.910" style="s2">quite useful because this didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.410" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">over and over again so we can just use</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.910" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">the classic example of the Maginot Line</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:09.640" style="s2">in World War two so the civil or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.590" style="s2">First World War was a big deal and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.640" end="00:19:13.540" style="s2">people work really really hard to figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.590" end="00:19:15.910" style="s2">out how to be very effective at winning</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.540" end="00:19:18.310" style="s2">the First World War and so techniques</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.310" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">concepts and frameworks went through a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.770" end="00:19:26.410" style="s2">very rapid iteration process at the at</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:28.690" style="s2">the actual edge right because getting it</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.410" end="00:19:30.040" style="s2">wrong killed you and they got good at it</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.690" end="00:19:33.160" style="s2">and so then they became experts at</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.040" end="00:19:35.260" style="s2">fighting World War one and so what they</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:37.150" style="s2">did is they they formalized that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.260" end="00:19:38.440" style="s2">knowledge in for the French particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.150" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">in this thing called the Maginot Line</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.440" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">which is the the best trench ever made</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">unfortunately it was met in the tire</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">stretch no people know they spent</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:50.770" style="s2">billions of dollars building this</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.750" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">was the categorical answer to the</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:05.910" style="s2">unfortunately when the Germans is they</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.510" end="00:20:08.800" style="s2">just obsolete a trench warfare</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.910" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">completely and a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.800" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">technical innovations were part of that</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.220" end="00:20:39.550" style="s2">it was a different game that&#39;s what end</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.780" end="00:20:41.170" style="s2">up happening is that the the French had</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.550" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">become exceptionally good at winning a</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:46.630" style="s2">playing and then Germans were playing a</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:59.259" style="s2">does one deal with accelerating change</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.589" end="00:25:01.479" style="s2">because during the the 19th century in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.259" end="00:25:03.309" style="s2">most of the 20th century the slope of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.479" end="00:25:05.079" style="s2">the curve of accelerating change was far</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.309" end="00:25:07.959" style="s2">enough apart that we could largely</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.079" end="00:25:09.940" style="s2">pretend the change was happening in sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.959" end="00:25:11.349" style="s2">of decade long cycle so we could you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.940" end="00:25:12.609" style="s2">know pretend that that was the case but</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.349" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">as you say now that the slope of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.609" end="00:25:18.009" style="s2">curve is getting steeper and steeper</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:19.989" style="s2">relative to our our agency and when</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.009" end="00:25:22.119" style="s2">changes happening in six months cycles</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.989" end="00:25:24.969" style="s2">we really have to begin formalizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.119" end="00:25:26.949" style="s2">entirely entire approaches around what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.969" end="00:25:31.029" style="s2">accelerating change itself actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.949" end="00:25:34.749" style="s2">and to me this is one of the key reasons</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.029" end="00:25:36.699" style="s2">why we need to use our intuitive mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.749" end="00:25:38.859" style="s2">along with our rational mind in business</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.699" end="00:25:40.659" style="s2">because the rational mind is great at</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.859" end="00:25:42.069" style="s2">dealing with changes that only happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.659" end="00:25:44.009" style="s2">every ten years you know you only have</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.069" end="00:25:46.359" style="s2">to rebuild your factory every ten years</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.009" end="00:25:48.729" style="s2">that is not true anymore you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.359" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">rebuild your processes every six months</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.729" end="00:25:54.069" style="s2">every month it&#39;s always changing and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:56.229" style="s2">only way you can tell is by pulling in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.069" end="00:25:59.409" style="s2">your intuitive thoughts as well as your</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.229" end="00:26:01.539" style="s2">rational rules in the end this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.409" end="00:26:02.739" style="s2">absolutely correct I mean we may even go</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.539" end="00:26:03.940" style="s2">a little bit further and talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.739" end="00:26:06.509" style="s2">fact that you have to begin building</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.940" end="00:26:11.190" style="s2">your organizational framework around</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.509" end="00:26:14.469" style="s2">that sense of intuitive sensibility I</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.190" end="00:26:16.419" style="s2">think man is really important it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.469" end="00:26:18.609" style="s2">just that someone in its the quote</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.419" end="00:26:20.769" style="s2">strategy department of your startup or</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.609" end="00:26:23.409" style="s2">your own enterprise needs to pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.769" end="00:26:26.589" style="s2">attention everyone in the organization</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.409" end="00:26:28.389" style="s2">needs to be aware of this and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.589" end="00:26:29.139" style="s2">just like how the German army impaired</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.389" end="00:26:31.509" style="s2">lower-level</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.139" end="00:26:34.209" style="s2">troops make decisions on the battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.509" end="00:26:36.279" style="s2">when you&#39;re in business you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.209" end="00:26:37.839" style="s2">like just the strategy department figure</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.279" end="00:26:40.690" style="s2">this out you know you can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.839" end="00:26:42.849" style="s2">strategy department in in kodak but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.690" end="00:26:45.129" style="s2">know business which was a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.849" end="00:26:47.199" style="s2">fortune 100 business that went out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.129" end="00:26:48.609" style="s2">business cuz their strategy departments</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.199" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">sort of new digital photography was</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.609" end="00:26:52.809" style="s2">coming along but that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:54.369" style="s2">people working in it weren&#39;t empowered</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.809" end="00:26:55.550" style="s2">to do anything about it and they went</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.369" end="00:26:58.110" style="s2">out of business</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.550" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">Sonia is funny we&#39;re using the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.110" end="00:27:01.890" style="s2">wars and metaphors but in point of fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:03.990" style="s2">we know that it wasn&#39;t just a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.890" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a set of techniques the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.990" end="00:27:08.670" style="s2">organizational methodologies that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:10.770" style="s2">like IBM and Kodak used were listed</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.670" end="00:27:13.290" style="s2">directly from the set of techniques that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.770" end="00:27:14.970" style="s2">won World War kit and the organizational</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.290" end="00:27:16.470" style="s2">approaches that were developed in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.970" end="00:27:18.990" style="s2">process of fighting and winning World</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.470" end="00:27:20.490" style="s2">War two we then applied across the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.990" end="00:27:21.960" style="s2">entire social field it was used to build</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.490" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">the interstate highway lead system is</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.960" end="00:27:27.000" style="s2">used to build NASA is used to build IBM</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:30.300" style="s2">and Kodak but but since then we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.000" end="00:27:34.590" style="s2">you know the Vietnam War where the Viet</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.300" end="00:27:36.360" style="s2">North Vietnamese you know used you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.590" end="00:27:40.350" style="s2">guerrilla warfare techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.360" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">distributed attacks and and they used</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.350" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">you know they managed to get inside the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:50.190" style="s2">American decision loop and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:54.060" style="s2">even though they were losing the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.190" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">war they won the current war yes quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.060" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">right yes this notion of a position that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:01.170" style="s2">were or as a the John Boyce the American</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">strategic theorist who came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.170" end="00:28:07.710" style="s2">concept the OODA loop Oda loop is I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:09.420" style="s2">think the concept is that it&#39;s going is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.710" end="00:28:11.160" style="s2">very timeless and I think more and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.420" end="00:28:13.620" style="s2">people are going to begin grasping it so</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.160" end="00:28:15.330" style="s2">would it be useful to try to define it</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.620" end="00:28:17.100" style="s2">more rigorously right now absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.330" end="00:28:19.530" style="s2">what does odor stand for for those</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.100" end="00:28:21.390" style="s2">who&#39;ve never come across it alright so</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.530" end="00:28:23.280" style="s2">this is actually as I mentioned I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.390" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">is a very very deep concept and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.280" end="00:28:26.250" style="s2">I think even the practitioners in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:28.620" style="s2">military who tell you that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.250" end="00:28:31.770" style="s2">understand it well enough so the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.620" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">that you the first Oh is observe and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.770" end="00:28:37.380" style="s2">can think of observe as your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.970" end="00:28:39.810" style="s2">which might be your organization or your</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.380" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">team or your individual capacity to pull</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.810" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">information in from the universe and by</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">the way your intuitive channel is part</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:49.950" style="s2">of that methodology the more you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:54.930" style="s2">to actually process things intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.950" end="00:28:57.330" style="s2">the more bandwidth you were Oh has the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.930" end="00:29:00.260" style="s2">second Oh is orient the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.330" end="00:29:03.240" style="s2">just being overwhelmed by a flood of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.260" end="00:29:05.580" style="s2">information is not helpful you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.240" end="00:29:08.400" style="s2">actually be able to take that and turn</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.580" end="00:29:10.920" style="s2">that from information into meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.400" end="00:29:13.530" style="s2">so orientation is your capacity to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.920" end="00:29:15.180" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s coming in and so if</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.530" end="00:29:17.670" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be tuning into our</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.180" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">intuitive channel we have to get better</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.670" end="00:29:21.990" style="s2">and better at listening to it and using</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:23.970" style="s2">it as a guide to then be making</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.990" end="00:29:27.330" style="s2">decisions which is the third the D</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.970" end="00:29:30.270" style="s2">decide as the decisions is taking sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.330" end="00:29:32.580" style="s2">and connecting sense to our action</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.270" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">potentials it&#39;s the bridge between what</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.580" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">we perceive as being going on and how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:40.200" style="s2">are going to actually respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:43.050" style="s2">deciding is the is the narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.200" end="00:29:44.670" style="s2">function that then hands out to act and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.050" end="00:29:49.170" style="s2">the action piece of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.670" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">agenting the actuator the the refined</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.170" end="00:29:54.630" style="s2">ability that we have to express our</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">energies into the world with the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.630" end="00:29:59.910" style="s2">most impact with the least effort and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.510" end="00:30:02.150" style="s2">with the least amount of externalization</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.910" end="00:30:06.690" style="s2">effects these sort of unanticipated</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.150" end="00:30:12.090" style="s2">consequences so and you deploy and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.690" end="00:30:14.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a loop so what&#39;s the loop where my</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.090" end="00:30:16.220" style="s2">observe orientate the side act and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.730" end="00:30:18.450" style="s2">you repeat it all over again right</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.220" end="00:30:20.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of reality or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.450" end="00:30:22.590" style="s2">universe outside of you comes in through</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.430" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">observe and then exits through some kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.590" end="00:30:26.490" style="s2">of expression some action or some change</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:28.290" style="s2">of behavior that you make in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.490" end="00:30:30.150" style="s2">which changes the state of the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.290" end="00:30:32.850" style="s2">which then you observe and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.150" end="00:30:34.920" style="s2">interesting enough the the common</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.850" end="00:30:37.860" style="s2">knowledge has is that the the fastest</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.920" end="00:30:40.740" style="s2">Buddha loop wins and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.860" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">not true the the better understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.740" end="00:30:45.660" style="s2">that the the Buddha loop of the highest</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">bandwidth win meaning that the one that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.660" end="00:30:52.470" style="s2">can handle the most for Rou it the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">fastest will win certain circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.470" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">having a very narrow band it&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">very rapid is highly effective but</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:30:59.780" style="s2">generally speaking what you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:04.560" style="s2">able to do is be able to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.780" end="00:31:08.160" style="s2">process decide on and act with the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.560" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">potential in the shortest amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.160" end="00:31:14.490" style="s2">and at the same time you want to slow</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:17.640" style="s2">down your opponent and cut their</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.490" end="00:31:20.220" style="s2">bandwidth oh yes so then in the game of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.640" end="00:31:21.040" style="s2">strategy if you are in fact interacting</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.220" end="00:31:24.820" style="s2">with other</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.040" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">which we generally are if you can do</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.820" end="00:31:30.309" style="s2">things to slow down or reduce the</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.850" end="00:32:19.870" style="s2">we&#39;re a little devious we&#39;re also trying</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.870" end="00:32:23.020" style="s2">down their bandwidth by cutting the</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.450" end="00:32:28.419" style="s2">they just don&#39;t process information so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.280" end="00:32:31.660" style="s2">quick because maybe they have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.419" end="00:32:33.490" style="s2">hierarchical structure and they you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.660" end="00:32:34.870" style="s2">only the top people in the organization</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.490" end="00:32:36.340" style="s2">do any of this and all the bottom people</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.870" end="00:32:38.350" style="s2">don&#39;t worry in our organization</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.340" end="00:32:42.340" style="s2">everyone&#39;s empowered to observe</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.350" end="00:32:43.630" style="s2">orientate and decide and act and take</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.340" end="00:32:46.660" style="s2">decisions and move the business forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.630" end="00:32:50.230" style="s2">and get feedback and and that ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.660" end="00:32:52.360" style="s2">for the organization to to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.230" end="00:32:54.850" style="s2">decisions quickly and change and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.360" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">maybe not have a coherent strategy but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.850" end="00:32:59.470" style="s2">like you know in Zappos shoes you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">the customer service representatives are</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.470" end="00:33:03.400" style="s2">impaired to decide what&#39;s best for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:05.370" style="s2">customer right they don&#39;t have to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.400" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">it up a hierarchy to find out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.370" end="00:33:10.360" style="s2">you know they have a faster route loop</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:14.040" style="s2">just so I got to do that and then this</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.360" end="00:33:17.140" style="s2">is part of the you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.040" end="00:33:19.870" style="s2">the organization doesn&#39;t seem to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.140" end="00:33:21.309" style="s2">consistent you know strategy but they</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.870" end="00:33:23.890" style="s2">make fast decisions that are good for</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.309" end="00:33:25.660" style="s2">their customers could be confusing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.890" end="00:33:27.160" style="s2">the opposition because they don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.660" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">know what they&#39;re doing but they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.160" end="00:33:31.330" style="s2">be doing it better right that&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:32.860" style="s2">slow down their bandwidth because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.330" end="00:33:34.889" style="s2">giving off so many different signals</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.860" end="00:33:36.879" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.889" end="00:33:40.209" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.879" end="00:33:41.739" style="s2">things that are put it because you use</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.209" end="00:33:44.139" style="s2">the phrase not having a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.739" end="00:33:45.879" style="s2">strategy and what&#39;s funny what&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.139" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">about that is the degree to which we</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.879" end="00:33:50.229" style="s2">have because we knew it grew up in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:52.690" style="s2">latter half of the 20th century broadly</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.229" end="00:33:56.159" style="s2">we have mapped the word strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.690" end="00:33:58.570" style="s2">actually mean a strategic plan in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.159" end="00:34:00.129" style="s2">bureaucratic hierarchical mode and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.570" end="00:34:02.199" style="s2">kind of thing that a strategy planning</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.129" end="00:34:04.839" style="s2">organization creates which has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.199" end="00:34:06.940" style="s2">disseminated or exploited that is how</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.839" end="00:34:08.829" style="s2">World War two was one right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.940" end="00:34:11.259" style="s2">exactly that all the big companies cup</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.829" end="00:34:13.539" style="s2">copied out of World War two that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.259" end="00:34:16.269" style="s2">haven&#39;t hierarchy you have a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.539" end="00:34:18.669" style="s2">use operational research techniques to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.269" end="00:34:20.559" style="s2">optimize your strategy but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.669" end="00:34:23.019" style="s2">individual soldiers just follow what</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.559" end="00:34:25.750" style="s2">they&#39;re told to do right boys pointed</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.019" end="00:34:28.599" style="s2">that if you understand that who&#39;da loop</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.750" end="00:34:30.549" style="s2">the band the engineering a higher end</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.599" end="00:34:32.440" style="s2">with little loop is strategy that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.549" end="00:34:34.809" style="s2">actions which strategy really is and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.440" end="00:34:38.319" style="s2">that the approach that you just</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.809" end="00:34:40.929" style="s2">described quite well is a an approach</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.319" end="00:34:43.329" style="s2">that optimized an odor loop for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.929" end="00:34:47.079" style="s2">environment of the 1950 to the 19th mid</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.329" end="00:34:49.569" style="s2">late nineteen seventies eighties back</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.079" end="00:34:51.369" style="s2">that&#39;s the deep insight and so now that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.569" end="00:34:52.419" style="s2">we&#39;re not in the 1980s using the seconds</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.369" end="00:34:54.669" style="s2">the nineteen eighties in fighting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.419" end="00:34:56.559" style="s2">last war so the rat the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.669" end="00:34:58.269" style="s2">is in fact the nature the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.559" end="00:35:01.329" style="s2">actual strategic thinking and planning</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.269" end="00:35:05.529" style="s2">that is appropriate for a network gate</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.329" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">and in my view it&#39;s probably more</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.529" end="00:35:09.519" style="s2">distributed it&#39;s probably people using</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">accessing their intuition as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.519" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">rational mind yeah and probably some</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:18.509" style="s2">other things I haven&#39;t even considered</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:20.980" style="s2">yet well we could take a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.509" end="00:35:23.230" style="s2">things that are more legible which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.980" end="00:35:26.740" style="s2">for example in the changing nature of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.230" end="00:35:29.309" style="s2">supply chain the ability to do logistics</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.740" end="00:35:32.380" style="s2">outsource logistics the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.309" end="00:35:33.789" style="s2">very very rapid experimental marketing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.380" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">through digital marketers social media</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.789" end="00:35:37.029" style="s2">is just very tactical handheld</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:39.099" style="s2">techniques it effectively everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.029" end="00:35:40.779" style="s2">familiar with and what these do what</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.099" end="00:35:42.849" style="s2">these changes in the economic framework</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.779" end="00:35:46.910" style="s2">have done in the past several decades is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.849" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">they&#39;ve enabled and also forced a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.910" end="00:35:50.569" style="s2">ranking of the nature of what the firm</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:53.180" style="s2">looks like so instead of having to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.569" end="00:35:54.619" style="s2">ownership of my logistical function to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:35:56.420" style="s2">be able to ship from where I am to where</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.619" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">my customer is I can outsource know</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:01.789" style="s2">point how loads are almost a cloud</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.690" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">sure that he gets to the end to the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.980" end="00:36:13.430" style="s2">customer and effectively commodity cost</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:16.369" style="s2">I no longer have to have an IT a giant</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:19.910" style="s2">IT department that builds out my my</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.369" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">hosting and bandwidth function I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.910" end="00:36:23.420" style="s2">outsource that to Amazon Web Services or</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.150" style="s2">Google and they and they optimize that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">but as it happens that my firm is</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:29.510" style="s2">empowered to shrink and become more and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">more focused on a smaller core</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.510" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">competency which then becomes a fluid</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.180" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">component of a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">marketplace and if I don&#39;t do that if I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:42.200" style="s2">sort of hold on to competencies that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:44.030" style="s2">not my core I&#39;m actually a radically</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.200" end="00:36:45.530" style="s2">less capable but everybody around me</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.030" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">which is to say that my little loop is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.530" end="00:36:48.980" style="s2">very slow because now I&#39;m doing things</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:50.569" style="s2">that are obsolete you know the Google</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.980" end="00:36:51.529" style="s2">has already fully optimized and why the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.569" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">hell am i doing that they&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.529" end="00:36:55.130" style="s2">done it perfectly we just plug into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.170" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.130" end="00:36:59.180" style="s2">that so in this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.170" end="00:37:00.829" style="s2">organizational structure as you said</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.180" end="00:37:02.599" style="s2">like the way the Wehrmacht&#39;s we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.829" end="00:37:04.910" style="s2">organized and pushed authority out to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.599" end="00:37:06.349" style="s2">different class of soldiers which left</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.910" end="00:37:10.220" style="s2">the higher ranks also had a different</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.220" end="00:37:15.079" style="s2">organizational structure is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.289" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">oriented around smaller groups that have</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.079" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2">very intense core competencies that find</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:21.559" style="s2">ways to then ally with and link with</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.690" end="00:37:40.099" style="s2">deal with the particular issue and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.430" end="00:37:42.529" style="s2">succeed there and then it disbands or</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.099" end="00:37:44.779" style="s2">reorganizes and the people move to</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.529" end="00:37:47.000" style="s2">different teams you know it may not be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.779" end="00:37:51.410" style="s2">permanent structure yeah I&#39;m gonna clean</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.000" end="00:37:53.510" style="s2">that my own company oh well cool I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.410" end="00:37:55.910" style="s2">it and and this is actually an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.510" end="00:37:58.579" style="s2">was used in I think it was Lockheed</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.910" end="00:38:00.260" style="s2">Martin in their skunk works which you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.579" end="00:38:00.829" style="s2">know they they wanted to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.260" end="00:38:03.789" style="s2">some new tech</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.829" end="00:38:06.170" style="s2">to sell to the army or the Air Force and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.789" end="00:38:07.609" style="s2">the traditional big hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.170" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">organization wasn&#39;t coming up with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.609" end="00:38:12.369" style="s2">and they locked up these really clever</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:15.499" style="s2">engineers and gave them some budget and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.369" end="00:38:17.660" style="s2">and they came up with some really new</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.499" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">technology because they were were</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.660" end="00:38:21.589" style="s2">separated from the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.920" end="00:38:24.589" style="s2">organization but I think that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.589" end="00:38:26.450" style="s2">gonna in you know invade the whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.589" end="00:38:28.069" style="s2">organization you know we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.450" end="00:38:31.130" style="s2">everything is going to be a skunkworks</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.069" end="00:38:33.109" style="s2">everything will be creating amazing new</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.130" end="00:38:35.420" style="s2">inventions but doing it in a temporary</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.109" end="00:38:39.559" style="s2">way for whatever needs doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.420" end="00:38:40.789" style="s2">moment yeah I think that&#39;s right I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.559" end="00:38:43.489" style="s2">the you know the challenge that people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.789" end="00:38:44.599" style="s2">who think organizationally is going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.489" end="00:38:48.319" style="s2">be figuring out where the efficient</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.599" end="00:38:50.839" style="s2">frontier is so it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.319" end="00:38:52.309" style="s2">be in a position where everybody has to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.839" end="00:38:54.859" style="s2">be a stem cell meaning that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.309" end="00:38:58.009" style="s2">has to sort of carry the full portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.859" end="00:39:00.289" style="s2">of capacities and skills this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.009" end="00:39:01.249" style="s2">seem likely to be efficient there still</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.289" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">needs to be division of labor and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.249" end="00:39:05.029" style="s2">specialization but it&#39;s certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:06.469" style="s2">case with the amount of division of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.029" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">labor specialization is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.469" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">lot less than it was actually 50s and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:13.880" style="s2">60s and this notion of fluid</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:15.469" style="s2">recombinations of groups of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.880" end="00:39:18.229" style="s2">that go here around some particular to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.469" end="00:39:20.209" style="s2">the function optimized for it in a time</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.229" end="00:39:23.449" style="s2">frame where the optimization is valid</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.209" end="00:39:24.709" style="s2">produce an artifact flow it into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.449" end="00:39:27.049" style="s2">marketplace and then maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.709" end="00:39:29.779" style="s2">disappear Rico here more studio model</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.049" end="00:39:32.809" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly being explored quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.779" end="00:39:34.699" style="s2">rapidly and of course you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.809" end="00:39:36.319" style="s2">living in an environment that while it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.699" end="00:39:40.009" style="s2">is changing very rapidly there are are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.319" end="00:39:42.769" style="s2">also sort of forces of viscosity</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.009" end="00:39:45.380" style="s2">companies like say Microsoft or Lockheed</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.769" end="00:39:47.539" style="s2">and who because they control enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.380" end="00:39:49.549" style="s2">power they have enough of resources and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.539" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">enough influence over the environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.549" end="00:39:53.199" style="s2">that they are trying to keep the niche</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to keep the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.199" end="00:39:57.079" style="s2">conducive to their way of being that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:40:00.109" style="s2">have these very interesting dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.079" end="00:40:02.359" style="s2">between the rate at which the past is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.109" end="00:40:06.440" style="s2">fading and the rate at which the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.359" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">is emerging and as an entrepreneur being</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.440" end="00:40:10.190" style="s2">able to flow in there you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:11.779" style="s2">a business is going to be interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.190" end="00:40:13.910" style="s2">with healthcare companies like health</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.779" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">insurance companies that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.910" end="00:40:17.809" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:19.150" style="s2">very unique dynamic of connecting what</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.000" end="00:40:28.549" style="s2">mammal or conversely do you just go</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.900" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">ahead and send it to committee sure play</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.549" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">mammal and just launch something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">23andme or Fitbit that go to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:37.670" style="s2">end-user and completely routes around</p>

<p begin="00:40:37.670" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">this may be excellences all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.259" end="00:40:43.700" style="s2">to the the initial conversation which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.230" style="s2">the you know the situational assessment</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.700" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">where the state of what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.230" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">the world right now well and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">recommend people read that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">although it&#39;s written geared towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">political talk you can reread the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:41:02.089" style="s2">article as applied to to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:04.519" style="s2">in business and there&#39;s you know just if</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.089" end="00:41:07.130" style="s2">we&#39;re okay swimming a little bit deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.519" end="00:41:08.839" style="s2">in swimming pool of ideas here into deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.130" end="00:41:10.670" style="s2">water I hope we haven&#39;t drowned too many</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.839" end="00:41:12.650" style="s2">listeners so far and then I promise</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.670" end="00:41:15.559" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to shallow water too for</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.650" end="00:41:20.420" style="s2">some actions that would make sense is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.559" end="00:41:21.650" style="s2">that okay with you Jordan so I think one</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.420" end="00:41:23.990" style="s2">of the things I got from your</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.650" end="00:41:27.079" style="s2">situational assessment is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.990" end="00:41:28.849" style="s2">a world culture war going on and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.079" end="00:41:31.069" style="s2">of label it you know world culture war</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.849" end="00:41:33.230" style="s2">two a bit like world war two but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.069" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">thing is unlike World War two which you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.230" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">know in the 1940s I think most people</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.089" style="s2">knew World War two was actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">but just imagine you were an</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.089" end="00:41:41.869" style="s2">entrepreneur back then and you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:44.630" style="s2">even know there was a war and you had</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.869" end="00:41:46.039" style="s2">your factory or business and you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.630" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">going along and you&#39;re wondering well</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.039" end="00:41:51.470" style="s2">why aren&#39;t my employees working so good</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:53.480" style="s2">and and why why is suddenly half my back</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.470" end="00:41:56.420" style="s2">Creed disappeared I didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.480" end="00:41:57.859" style="s2">bombs existed you know can you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.420" end="00:41:58.940" style="s2">how this robbed it that would be for</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.859" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">your business if you didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.940" end="00:42:02.539" style="s2">the war was going on and on the flip</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:04.190" style="s2">side what an opportunity suppose you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.539" end="00:42:05.809" style="s2">knew oh there is a war going on and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.190" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">could retool the business to help out my</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.809" end="00:42:12.259" style="s2">country in whatever way that could</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:13.759" style="s2">happen or however you adjust to it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.259" end="00:42:15.319" style="s2">you decided oh I&#39;m gonna relocate my</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.759" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">business to Latin America because I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.319" end="00:42:20.089" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">this particular war many ways you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.089" end="00:42:24.619" style="s2">take it but if you don&#39;t even know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:28.490" style="s2">world culture war is going on you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.619" end="00:42:30.140" style="s2">kind of screwed yeah well if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.490" end="00:42:31.430" style="s2">the example that just keeps him with him</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.140" end="00:42:32.930" style="s2">for me because I have lived it was I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.430" end="00:42:36.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.930" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">financial crisis was going on in 2007 I</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.680" end="00:42:41.810" style="s2">was along the run with virtually</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:44.030" style="s2">everybody else and it was and if I had</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.810" end="00:42:48.109" style="s2">known obviously I was a video faster</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.030" end="00:42:51.640" style="s2">better decision so so the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.109" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">we&#39;re currently immersed deeply in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.640" end="00:42:55.849" style="s2">culture were and I think it doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.720" end="00:42:57.170" style="s2">world culture war and then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.849" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">difficult understand because it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:01.580" style="s2">all like the culture world in cities</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:04.369" style="s2">some of it is over</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.580" end="00:43:06.680" style="s2">these were world culture war one in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.369" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">terminology yes it&#39;s a great way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:10.520" style="s2">putting it yeah in fact it may even be</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:11.960" style="s2">that there may actually be more than</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.520" end="00:43:18.020" style="s2">just a metaphor that may actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.960" end="00:43:20.540" style="s2">very close map the the 60s and 70s was</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.020" end="00:43:22.580" style="s2">world culture war one it and you know to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.540" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">a greater or lesser extent certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.580" end="00:43:27.619" style="s2">the West in Western Europe the United</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:29.330" style="s2">States Japan China the Middle East so</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.619" end="00:43:30.859" style="s2">there were a little bit shifted on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.330" end="00:43:32.750" style="s2">and what was happening now is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.859" end="00:43:34.040" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of the ripple effects of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.750" end="00:43:35.089" style="s2">what happened in the West what happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.040" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">to the rest of the world are beginning</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.089" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">to realign in what seems like a single</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:44.030" style="s2">world&#39;s culture work to and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:46.339" style="s2">happening is a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.030" end="00:43:47.869" style="s2">elements are all lining so the if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.339" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">think about culture it&#39;s not just being</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.869" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">stuff like and this prosaic stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:57.800" style="s2">their you know fashion or the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">are having balance or politics so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.800" end="00:44:03.500" style="s2">really thinking about culture is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.390" end="00:44:05.780" style="s2">nature of how we go about as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.500" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">and groups making sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.780" end="00:44:09.230" style="s2">making sense of our identity who we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:11.180" style="s2">making sense of who we work with and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.230" end="00:44:13.700" style="s2">and why in terms of purpose and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.180" end="00:44:14.839" style="s2">asking your culture is a big piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.700" end="00:44:16.820" style="s2">the framework of how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.839" end="00:44:20.030" style="s2">building our individual group Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.820" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">loops and what&#39;s happening right now is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.030" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2">that big waves are pushing through</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">global cultures and they are disrupting</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.140" end="00:44:32.869" style="s2">all the old ways of doing them and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">are giving rise to entirely new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.869" end="00:44:36.859" style="s2">doing it so it&#39;s very akin to a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:39.500" style="s2">rapid shift I&#39;m going to jungle to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.859" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">desert and so what&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.500" end="00:44:43.250" style="s2">the there are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:44.870" style="s2">this artifacts like for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.250" end="00:44:49.150" style="s2">United States we have the surface sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.870" end="00:44:53.480" style="s2">that there is some kind of red</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.150" end="00:44:54.950" style="s2">Republican Trump thing that we may map</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.480" end="00:44:59.450" style="s2">saying oh it&#39;s the Republicans that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.950" end="00:45:01.610" style="s2">remember from the 1980s versus the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.450" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">Democrats remember from the 1980s but</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.610" end="00:45:06.020" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not I don&#39;t think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.180" style="s2">really happening it was really happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.020" end="00:45:10.190" style="s2">I think is that there&#39;s more profound</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.180" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">transitions that are going on under the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.190" end="00:45:16.250" style="s2">surface and that what I call the the red</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">religion or the insurgency the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.250" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">insurgency have began to form entirely</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:23.840" style="s2">new rue de loops entirely new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:26.120" style="s2">collective intelligence that are more</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.840" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">closely in alignment with the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.120" end="00:45:30.890" style="s2">the transformations that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">below the surface and in many ways only</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.890" end="00:45:35.270" style="s2">superficially resemble the Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.850" style="s2">of the Reagan era if you actually saw</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.270" end="00:45:39.950" style="s2">just did a straight semantic mapping mmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.850" end="00:45:41.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not particularly close they just</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.950" end="00:45:43.070" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of wearing those that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.660" end="00:45:44.780" style="s2">clothing because that just happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.070" end="00:45:47.060" style="s2">where they&#39;re able to get above the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.780" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">surface but they&#39;re pulling some other</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.060" end="00:45:53.450" style="s2">new kind of cultural coherence driven by</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:57.140" style="s2">a more adaptive response to what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.450" end="00:46:00.910" style="s2">on underneath the surface and then so by</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.140" end="00:46:03.050" style="s2">contrast this this thing that I call the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.910" end="00:46:04.520" style="s2">establishment and the blue church which</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.050" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">are related to not exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.520" end="00:46:10.280" style="s2">which the Democratic Party certainly is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:12.500" style="s2">still closely connected with they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.280" end="00:46:14.900" style="s2">fighting the last war and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.500" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">the reasons why they&#39;re losing in spite</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.900" end="00:46:17.780" style="s2">of the fact that they have a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.250" style="s2">of resources that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.780" end="00:46:21.590" style="s2">something which is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.250" end="00:46:23.270" style="s2">swimming against the current of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.590" end="00:46:24.950" style="s2">big changes that are going on underneath</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.270" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">the surface and one of these big changes</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.950" end="00:46:29.810" style="s2">is technical their shift from television</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:32.810" style="s2">and newspaper to the Internet is a major</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.810" end="00:46:35.420" style="s2">shift and the blue church is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.810" end="00:46:39.350" style="s2">optimized for television and newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.420" end="00:46:39.800" style="s2">and is completely now adapted to social</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.350" end="00:46:42.170" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.800" end="00:46:45.020" style="s2">by contrast the red religion which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.170" end="00:46:48.410" style="s2">again not the Republicans of the Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.020" end="00:46:50.360" style="s2">era is in many ways the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.410" end="00:46:52.610" style="s2">social media more so than even adapted</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.360" end="00:46:54.690" style="s2">to it is expressionist social media but</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.610" end="00:46:58.259" style="s2">it&#39;s begun to grasp mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.690" end="00:47:00.869" style="s2">and Cohibas means intuitive into what</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.259" end="00:47:03.539" style="s2">feels a little bit like something like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.869" end="00:47:06.329" style="s2">narrative that is now beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.539" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">out-compete the bleed Church in this new</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.329" end="00:47:11.609" style="s2">emergent environment and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:14.069" style="s2">somewhat analogous to the Vietnam War</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.609" end="00:47:16.349" style="s2">where the American and South Vietnamese</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.069" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">were fighting the last war they had</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.349" end="00:47:21.509" style="s2">incredible you know superiority in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:24.529" style="s2">numbers of bombs and tanks and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.509" end="00:47:26.670" style="s2">what-have-you and you know it had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.529" end="00:47:29.490" style="s2">organization based on the World War two</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.670" end="00:47:31.380" style="s2">kind of model that won World War two but</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.490" end="00:47:33.779" style="s2">the North Vietnamese and the Viet Minh</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.380" end="00:47:36.809" style="s2">they had a more nimble approach that had</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.779" end="00:47:39.660" style="s2">a faster OODA loop and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.809" end="00:47:41.730" style="s2">were able to totally destroy that even</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.660" end="00:47:44.730" style="s2">though the establishment looked like</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.730" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">they should have won yes that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.730" end="00:47:49.049" style="s2">right it&#39;s important to recognize for</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:51.299" style="s2">example for anybody who wants to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.049" end="00:47:54.809" style="s2">get deeper into the actual history the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.299" end="00:47:57.420" style="s2">degree to which the the vision in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.809" end="00:48:01.079" style="s2">Vietcong were able to play with and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.420" end="00:48:04.589" style="s2">connect with disruptive forces inside</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.079" end="00:48:06.809" style="s2">the American social cultural fabric</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.589" end="00:48:09.779" style="s2">right because that was degrading the you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.809" end="00:48:11.130" style="s2">know loop of the establishment is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.779" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">very much an important piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.130" end="00:48:15.019" style="s2">story when you&#39;re when you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:17.970" style="s2">that kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.019" end="00:48:20.309" style="s2">so that cultural war is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.970" end="00:48:21.630" style="s2">now in America and in Western society</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.309" end="00:48:23.940" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just in America this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.630" end="00:48:25.650" style="s2">a symptom of the Britax and the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.940" end="00:48:31.289" style="s2">things going on in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.650" end="00:48:33.089" style="s2">right and you know you if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.289" end="00:48:34.710" style="s2">understand this war is going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.089" end="00:48:37.769" style="s2">entirely possible our business might</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.710" end="00:48:39.750" style="s2">guess you know collateral damage from</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.769" end="00:48:41.250" style="s2">what happening yes I would say with</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.750" end="00:48:44.430" style="s2">absolute certainty the magnitude this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.250" end="00:48:47.759" style="s2">way too large to not have collateral</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.430" end="00:48:49.140" style="s2">effects on all all businesses certainly</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.759" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">business is above a certain order of</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.140" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">magnitude in size what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:57.450" style="s2">because this is so big you will actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:59.220" style="s2">tend to affect really big companies like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.450" end="00:49:00.750" style="s2">say Google who otherwise have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.220" end="00:49:03.089" style="s2">largely unaffected because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.750" end="00:49:04.140" style="s2">strong enough to kind of hold even the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.089" end="00:49:05.220" style="s2">biggest companies are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.140" end="00:49:06.089" style="s2">affected by this which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.220" end="00:49:07.160" style="s2">reasons why they started to get very</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.089" end="00:49:10.700" style="s2">nervous</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.160" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">I think this is something really</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.700" end="00:49:15.500" style="s2">important for people to grasp let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">back to the shallow end of the pool what</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.500" end="00:49:20.330" style="s2">are some concrete actions you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">recommend people taking to take</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.330" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">opportunity from this cultural war or to</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:30.620" style="s2">protect their assets well I mean a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:32.750" style="s2">of that of course depends on a weird</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.620" end="00:49:35.600" style="s2">position in the world we can say for</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.750" end="00:49:39.260" style="s2">certain is a couple of things the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.600" end="00:49:42.380" style="s2">is that people are going to be attending</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.260" end="00:49:45.850" style="s2">to these issues so if your business is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.380" end="00:49:48.920" style="s2">business that relates to individuals</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.850" end="00:49:50.660" style="s2">psychology their sense of safety this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.920" end="00:49:54.230" style="s2">it well-being the sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.660" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">empowered it is sense of obvious</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.230" end="00:49:58.810" style="s2">opportunities that emerge there so which</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:01.070" style="s2">are going to be sort of unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.810" end="00:50:03.800" style="s2">abilities to exploit people which I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.070" end="00:50:05.000" style="s2">would recommend people avoid but many of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.800" end="00:50:08.030" style="s2">which are exactly one to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.000" end="00:50:10.130" style="s2">necessary mechanisms to help people find</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.030" end="00:50:12.320" style="s2">ways to respond to it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.130" end="00:50:15.490" style="s2">going to be an increasingly chaotic and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.320" end="00:50:17.870" style="s2">increasingly intensely distressful</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.490" end="00:50:19.580" style="s2">environment things are going to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.870" end="00:50:21.530" style="s2">less and less sense seem more and more</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.580" end="00:50:23.360" style="s2">dangerous over the next several years</p>
