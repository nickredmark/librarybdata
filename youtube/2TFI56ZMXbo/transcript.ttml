<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">Jim rut show</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.580" end="00:00:17.830" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:20.500" style="s2">today&#39;s guest is Peter Wang co-founder</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.830" end="00:00:22.090" style="s2">and CTO at anaconda a leader in Python</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.500" end="00:00:24.760" style="s2">technologies for scientific computing</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.090" end="00:00:27.220" style="s2">and data analytics and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.760" end="00:00:30.700" style="s2">Python the computer language not pipe on</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.220" end="00:00:31.060" style="s2">the snake well hi Jim it&#39;s great to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.700" end="00:00:32.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.060" end="00:00:34.510" style="s2">Peter&#39;s not only a very accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.560" end="00:00:36.670" style="s2">technologist in the Python space but</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.510" end="00:00:38.470" style="s2">also is a deep thinker about our present</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.670" end="00:00:41.470" style="s2">world and how our technologically driven</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.470" end="00:00:43.809" style="s2">networked culture and humans interact</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.470" end="00:00:45.280" style="s2">today and how they can better interact</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.809" end="00:00:48.129" style="s2">in the future at least if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.280" end="00:00:50.170" style="s2">survive he&#39;s also a leader in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.129" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">about next-generation distributed web</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.170" end="00:00:54.670" style="s2">technologies so we got a lot to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:56.500" style="s2">about Peter so let&#39;s start with an</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.670" end="00:00:59.260" style="s2">update on what&#39;s going on in the Python</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.500" end="00:01:01.089" style="s2">world one observation I have I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.260" end="00:01:04.510" style="s2">Python user I&#39;ve heard of learn Python</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.089" end="00:01:07.390" style="s2">at the hello world level in 2004 soon</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.510" end="00:01:10.150" style="s2">thereafter you replaced my use of Perl</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.390" end="00:01:11.710" style="s2">with Python for you know text mangling</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.150" end="00:01:15.159" style="s2">and what have you then started using it</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.710" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">more seriously in 2013 and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.159" end="00:01:18.820" style="s2">probably my number two language after</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:20.950" style="s2">c-sharp and one things always been an</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.820" end="00:01:23.829" style="s2">issue in the Python world is version 2</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.950" end="00:01:26.860" style="s2">versus version 3 it now looks like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.829" end="00:01:29.140" style="s2">decisively past that gap and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.860" end="00:01:29.740" style="s2">like version 3 from now on out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.140" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.740" end="00:01:34.329" style="s2">version 3 is I mean the Train is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:37.299" style="s2">only left the station but as of December</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.329" end="00:01:39.460" style="s2">31st of this year the version 2 platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.299" end="00:01:41.740" style="s2">will no longer be maintained all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.460" end="00:01:43.719" style="s2">developers are moving to only supporting</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.740" end="00:01:45.579" style="s2">and maintaining to version 3 that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.719" end="00:01:47.590" style="s2">my rule for at least three years is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.579" end="00:01:49.420" style="s2">unless there&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.590" end="00:01:51.549" style="s2">indispensable library that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.420" end="00:01:53.560" style="s2">version 3 compatible I always went with</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.549" end="00:01:55.509" style="s2">version 3 and now I&#39;m seeing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.560" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">the you know the big main libraries have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.509" end="00:02:00.130" style="s2">actually started to drop v2 support so</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:03.100" style="s2">finally the decision is clear yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.130" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">only took 10 years you know but and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.100" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">retrospect a screwy decision to made</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:10.240" style="s2">that fork over such minor issues but hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">it is what it is and it&#39;s now finally</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.240" end="00:02:14.520" style="s2">you know rejoined and it&#39;s version 3</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">Hereafter now one question that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.520" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">love bass got like you probably sees</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">absolutely everything in the Python</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">space what are some interesting new</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">libraries and capabilities that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">entered the Python space in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">couple of years one thing I&#39;ll say up</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">front is that the Python space is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">huge now it is I think by many counts</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:33.570" style="s2">the number three most popular</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:36.240" style="s2">programming language and so no one</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.570" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">really can see all of it but the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.240" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">few years have in the general Python</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">space been consumed by the two versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">three transition and what happens to two</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">right and then also the async i/o and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">asynchronous programming a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">things have have just had some growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:52.920" style="s2">pains they&#39;ve been going through in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:54.960" style="s2">data science and machine learning space</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">however there&#39;s a ton of new stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.960" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">that&#39;s where I do have a lot more depth</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:01.490" style="s2">and understanding and there I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">that in the last few years we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.490" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">obviously tensorflow you know started</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">happening I guess about a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:11.430" style="s2">ago for deep learning and then we had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">few other frameworks that came out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.430" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing now as the glow I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:16.830" style="s2">think the initial burst and glow from</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">that phase we&#39;re seeing more libraries</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.830" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">come out that sort of deconstruct what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.510" style="s2">deep learning library is and create more</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">general vector computing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.510" end="00:03:27.600" style="s2">optimization stuff so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.540" style="s2">some really cool stuff related to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.600" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">Rapids from the Nvidia folks using some</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.540" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">of our technologies like numba desk and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">what else oh there&#39;s some automated</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">machine learning tools that have come</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">out for just getting people a faster</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">start you know over all these different</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">possible machine learning models so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">think those are some of the key ones</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">there&#39;s just so much going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.020" style="s2">really it&#39;s actually kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">interesting problem that we suffer there</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.020" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">where there&#39;s too almost too much</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">happening for anyone to keep track of I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:03:55.740" style="s2">think I always worry and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:57.420" style="s2">know about how evolution doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.740" end="00:04:00.120" style="s2">converge to the right solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.420" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">are some really good tools being ignored</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.120" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">due to evolutionary drift essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">you know where for whatever reason you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.140" style="s2">know three tools let&#39;s say higher level</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:12.510" style="s2">wrappers around tensorflow which has</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.140" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">been a hot area of late and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.510" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">one wins I don&#39;t know and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:18.419" style="s2">do we keep enough diversity in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:21.750" style="s2">ecosystem to make sure that guys who</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.419" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">should win do it well gosh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.750" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to unpack in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:28.470" style="s2">question so I think there&#39;s a defense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">the ecosystem that&#39;s separate from</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.470" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">putting your finger on the scale and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">saying this library should win and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">fact if you have a generative ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">then no single person can say what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:41.070" style="s2">the right thing and we almost we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">round trip it and run a loop through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.070" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">user space right through the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:47.820" style="s2">community and people actually applying</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">the stuff in practice so we might you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.820" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">know developers we always have internal</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">intrinsic attributes of a library that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">we optimize for we&#39;ll say oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">more elegant this one has newer</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:04:59.580" style="s2">techniques so and so forth but until you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">actually put it out and run a round trip</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.580" end="00:05:04.500" style="s2">through you know user space you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">know what&#39;s really critical right but to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.500" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">actually answer your question I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">that one of the things I really very</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.860" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">strongly feel we have an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">do well in Python space especially on</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:17.699" style="s2">machine learning is to articulate a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">modern defense of what used to be called</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.699" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">open source but it&#39;s something different</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">and it&#39;s a generative contribution gift</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:26.970" style="s2">economy around source code sharing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not inhibited or anchored by</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.970" end="00:05:33.720" style="s2">legacy approaches to IP and software</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:35.580" style="s2">modernization so this kind of got really</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.720" end="00:05:37.169" style="s2">deeply fast what I mean is we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.580" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">about like people know I&#39;m an open</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.169" end="00:05:40.139" style="s2">source advocate you know people know a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:42.150" style="s2">lot of Python stuff happens open source</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.139" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">but I think the term open source is</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">measure that&#39;s popular is people look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.459" end="00:08:45.709" style="s2">popularity rank how many downloads off</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:48.339" style="s2">pie-pie how he downloads off of Conda or</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.709" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">anaconda how many questions are there on</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:56.420" style="s2">for that particular project those are so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:08:59.149" style="s2">all these kind of like proximal measures</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.420" end="00:09:01.310" style="s2">of the healthiness of a project but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.149" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">unfortunately the way this goes some</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.310" end="00:09:05.269" style="s2">software some projects that are very</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">useful very solid they don&#39;t need much</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.269" end="00:09:09.290" style="s2">fixing they actually do a very small</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:10.760" style="s2">thing very well and they sit around they</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.290" end="00:09:12.860" style="s2">have no activity for a few years but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.760" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;re still perfectly fine and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.860" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a biased source of newness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.019" style="s2">activity there which is unfortunate so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:19.850" style="s2">we definitely lack for that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.019" end="00:09:20.660" style="s2">any you know further on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.850" end="00:09:22.610" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.660" end="00:09:24.290" style="s2">decentralization we are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.610" end="00:09:26.630" style="s2">exactly that problem here any time you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.290" end="00:09:28.850" style="s2">have an abundance of options now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.630" end="00:09:31.700" style="s2">got a curatorial need right and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.850" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">curation becomes very important so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.700" end="00:09:36.260" style="s2">thinking about ideas to improve that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.230" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">here at anaconda actually and we do play</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.260" end="00:09:41.269" style="s2">a very interesting role in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:43.459" style="s2">so we do have visibility into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.269" end="00:09:45.140" style="s2">things that could inform such a curation</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.459" end="00:09:46.820" style="s2">&#39;el system but we want to make sure we</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.140" end="00:09:48.470" style="s2">do in a way that&#39;s not ham-fisted we</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.820" end="00:09:50.089" style="s2">want to do in a way that you know does</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.470" end="00:09:51.410" style="s2">surface again I talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.089" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">which is that sometimes projects don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.410" end="00:09:55.430" style="s2">release very often or actually very</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">stable and should be the ones you do use</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.430" end="00:10:00.199" style="s2">right yep it&#39;s not it&#39;s certainly not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:02.690" style="s2">simple linear problem right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.199" end="00:10:04.699" style="s2">multi-dimensional nonlinear problem and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.690" end="00:10:08.329" style="s2">you mentioned a lot of things I use how</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.699" end="00:10:10.790" style="s2">many downloads does the community seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.329" end="00:10:13.430" style="s2">alive you know are there mailing lists</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.790" end="00:10:15.350" style="s2">or discussion groups you know help I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.430" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">use how often is it updated but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.350" end="00:10:20.060" style="s2">use that as a binary as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">some very nice mature packages really</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.060" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">don&#39;t need the updating right so why</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:25.880" style="s2">should you care about that the other one</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:28.970" style="s2">I like to look at is look at the issues</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.880" end="00:10:30.170" style="s2">list on github and if there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.970" end="00:10:31.699" style="s2">issues out there that nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.170" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">addressing that&#39;s usually not a good</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:37.339" style="s2">can also be a different part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.510" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">quadrant which is this is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.339" end="00:10:41.209" style="s2">useful library that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:43.010" style="s2">suddenly found massive popularity and</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.769" end="00:10:52.040" style="s2">much of a ratio but we do see this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:53.690" style="s2">really interesting phenomenon now where</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.040" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">because Python has gotten mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.690" end="00:10:57.230" style="s2">people their jobs depend on it right you</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.450" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">doing this and then the other and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:19.790" style="s2">volunteer maintainer is like well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:22.279" style="s2">not getting paid for it and there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.790" end="00:11:24.680" style="s2">the incredible mismatch and disparity</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.279" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">between the expectations of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.680" end="00:11:29.660" style="s2">say the standard labor economics around</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">white collar work that uses this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.660" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">software and then the generative</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:36.589" style="s2">abundance gift economy economics that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:38.420" style="s2">part of the sharing tribal culture that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.589" end="00:11:39.649" style="s2">produces the software and at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.420" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">intersection of these two things</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.649" end="00:11:43.850" style="s2">there&#39;s not many tangent points between</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:46.070" style="s2">these two circles in fact so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.850" end="00:11:47.480" style="s2">of my things I like to nerd out on which</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.070" end="00:11:49.130" style="s2">is actually also an intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.480" end="00:11:51.050" style="s2">meta-level its intersection between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.130" end="00:11:52.220" style="s2">circles of my you know my day job and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.050" end="00:11:54.380" style="s2">all those Python stuff and open-source</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.220" end="00:11:56.029" style="s2">community and then also my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2">about you know future of human</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.029" end="00:12:00.529" style="s2">civilization and collective you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">dynamics and things like that yep sounds</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.529" end="00:12:03.829" style="s2">like you&#39;re the right guy to be there to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:05.570" style="s2">be thinking about this and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.829" end="00:12:07.190" style="s2">Python community is amazing but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.570" end="00:12:08.750" style="s2">could make it even more amazing if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.190" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">could come up with some way to help</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.750" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">people sort through that without putting</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:14.870" style="s2">the thumb on the scale prematurely right</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:17.720" style="s2">or at all right how do you get an</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.870" end="00:12:19.430" style="s2">emergent signal that&#39;s a good signal we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.720" end="00:12:21.350" style="s2">will come back to that problem again and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.430" end="00:12:22.790" style="s2">again I mean it&#39;s funny you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.350" end="00:12:24.380" style="s2">the things that we look at you know this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.790" end="00:12:25.520" style="s2">distributed search problem you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.380" end="00:12:27.500" style="s2">people say well why can&#39;t we have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.520" end="00:12:28.790" style="s2">distributed Facebook right well turns</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.500" end="00:12:30.410" style="s2">out it&#39;s a pain in the ass to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.790" end="00:12:32.089" style="s2">make it searchable or hate if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.410" end="00:12:33.290" style="s2">has their own copy so these problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.089" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">come up again</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.290" end="00:12:36.769" style="s2">again now I like to go to next is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:38.690" style="s2">something I know you&#39;ve thought about</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.769" end="00:12:43.070" style="s2">and talked about a little bit and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.690" end="00:12:45.370" style="s2">is the match and mismatch between human</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.070" end="00:12:48.290" style="s2">cognition and our worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.370" end="00:12:50.810" style="s2">technologically driven networks Mis</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.290" end="00:12:53.480" style="s2">master&#39;s in human cognition and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.810" end="00:12:55.459" style="s2">worldwide networks technologically</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.480" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">driven network how you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.459" end="00:13:00.019" style="s2">talked about things like speciation ok</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:01.579" style="s2">well where would you like to start start</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.019" end="00:13:03.019" style="s2">saying what you think about this problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.579" end="00:13:05.079" style="s2">you know that the human cognition was</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.019" end="00:13:08.149" style="s2">not designed for fractal huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.079" end="00:13:09.740" style="s2">instantaneous worldwide network right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.149" end="00:13:11.750" style="s2">there&#39;s two pieces of this so one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.740" end="00:13:13.610" style="s2">them is tied to the limitations of human</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.750" end="00:13:15.500" style="s2">cognition you know I was actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.610" end="00:13:17.180" style="s2">listening to the Krakauer interview that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.500" end="00:13:19.430" style="s2">you did and he talks about it really</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.180" end="00:13:21.380" style="s2">well there as well he talks about you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.430" end="00:13:23.000" style="s2">know all of our analytical models we</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.380" end="00:13:24.920" style="s2">were really solving for how to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.000" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">shorter model description than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.920" end="00:13:29.480" style="s2">phenomenological of observations right</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:31.310" style="s2">and a thing I like to say about this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.480" end="00:13:33.589" style="s2">that humans really are narrowband</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.310" end="00:13:37.009" style="s2">sensors that have a preference for</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.589" end="00:13:38.930" style="s2">structure so we really we can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.009" end="00:13:40.459" style="s2">see the world in terms of structure and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.930" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">that structures how we compress sensory</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.459" end="00:13:45.290" style="s2">input structures how we compress our</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:46.850" style="s2">description of phenomenon and we really</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.290" end="00:13:48.350" style="s2">have very narrow bandwidth to process</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.850" end="00:13:50.120" style="s2">these things and to retain them and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.350" end="00:13:51.980" style="s2">remember them remember these compressed</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.120" end="00:13:53.660" style="s2">versions of them like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.980" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">little reduced hashes of them not the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.660" end="00:13:58.459" style="s2">full description so human cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:01.339" style="s2">really I mean our brains are just these</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.459" end="00:14:05.209" style="s2">patterning engines and that works fine</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.339" end="00:14:07.819" style="s2">in 3 plus 1 D space that we grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.209" end="00:14:10.069" style="s2">had to hunt animals in and greed in but</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.819" end="00:14:12.709" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done in all of our caloric</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.069" end="00:14:14.980" style="s2">access in modernity we&#39;ve created now</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.709" end="00:14:17.630" style="s2">technological infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.980" end="00:14:18.889" style="s2">exposes all of this extra like cycles</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.630" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">that we have in our brains to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.889" end="00:14:22.939" style="s2">completely different massively high</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.949" style="s2">bandwidth set of perceptual inputs that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.939" end="00:14:26.360" style="s2">are all virtual it&#39;s all virtuality but</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.949" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">through our eyes and our ears I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.360" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">even this podcast is an instance of such</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:33.699" style="s2">we are exposed to a space that or to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:35.720" style="s2">set of sensory things that inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.699" end="00:14:39.649" style="s2">dimensions they carve out dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.720" end="00:14:42.019" style="s2">they are well beyond the 3+1 D that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.649" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">that our brains really were evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.019" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">succeed in and these worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:47.570" style="s2">or s the communications networks what</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:49.970" style="s2">they&#39;ve really done is now they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.570" end="00:14:52.900" style="s2">created a place where signals and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.970" end="00:14:54.860" style="s2">messages and ideas bounce around and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.900" end="00:14:56.300" style="s2">essentially have a life of their own and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.860" end="00:14:58.400" style="s2">what I like to think about is this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.300" end="00:14:59.660" style="s2">kind of if I could use a model that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.400" end="00:15:01.610" style="s2">maybe we come back to over and over in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.660" end="00:15:03.650" style="s2">this podcast but let&#39;s think of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.610" end="00:15:06.350" style="s2">human being is almost like a connected</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.650" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">series of rods or masses suspended in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.350" end="00:15:10.550" style="s2">water and different layers of water have</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">different densities maybe different</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.550" end="00:15:14.690" style="s2">temperatures and we&#39;re loosely connected</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.700" style="s2">and we&#39;re each of us we&#39;re just every</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.690" end="00:15:19.280" style="s2">single one of us has multiple planes</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.700" end="00:15:20.840" style="s2">that we live in but at the highest plane</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.280" end="00:15:22.790" style="s2">the intellectual plane we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.840" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">of that as kind of this very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.790" end="00:15:27.770" style="s2">rarefied air but actually our</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:30.980" style="s2">intellectual brains and our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.770" end="00:15:34.130" style="s2">brains that tear of us it is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.980" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">substrate for a massive amounts of wave</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.130" end="00:15:37.460" style="s2">patterns and signals that bounce off</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.750" end="00:15:39.260" style="s2">each other some cancel each other out</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.460" end="00:15:41.060" style="s2">some reinforce each other so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.260" end="00:15:44.150" style="s2">really like little particles of water or</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.060" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">atoms molecules of h2o in this giant</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.150" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">ocean and that&#39;s really my model for</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.460" end="00:15:49.670" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now why it&#39;s so hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:50.870" style="s2">for people to talk about it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.670" end="00:15:54.380" style="s2">people still think of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.870" end="00:15:57.200" style="s2">essentially individual whole atomic</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:15:59.270" style="s2">things that maybe read a book or watch a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.200" end="00:16:01.370" style="s2">TV show or listen to a sound byte but</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.270" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">actually we have to almost deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.370" end="00:16:06.140" style="s2">what it is to be human and realized that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:08.810" style="s2">you know there&#39;s so much more signal</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.140" end="00:16:10.460" style="s2">pressure on this cultural intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.810" end="00:16:12.950" style="s2">part of us and that actually causes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.460" end="00:16:14.570" style="s2">disconnect in neuroticism as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.950" end="00:16:16.400" style="s2">disconnects with our internal narrative</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.570" end="00:16:18.500" style="s2">going between these different connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.400" end="00:16:20.120" style="s2">pieces that comprise us so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:22.190" style="s2">a lot to unpack there but I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.120" end="00:16:23.990" style="s2">put that model out there as how how I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.190" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">see the world and why I think right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.990" end="00:16:28.280" style="s2">we&#39;re in such a weird place like we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:30.080" style="s2">metaphysical problems we have a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.280" end="00:16:32.600" style="s2">of philosophy so I like to say because</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.080" end="00:16:34.820" style="s2">our model of self our model of agency or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.600" end="00:16:36.920" style="s2">model of what even a human person is our</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.820" end="00:16:38.330" style="s2">human reality is or how important</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.920" end="00:16:40.100" style="s2">consensus reality is all those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.330" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">breaking down do they haven&#39;t you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.100" end="00:16:45.770" style="s2">this is by necessity because of the new</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:47.000" style="s2">modality or is it part of learning you</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:01.130" style="s2">now past that point there really is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:03.650" style="s2">binary point I mean there&#39;s a hard limit</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.130" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">to how many pixels and what frame rate</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.650" end="00:18:06.830" style="s2">you need coming into your eyeballs for</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">you to see something that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.830" end="00:18:12.110" style="s2">real right there is some audio encoding</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">bit rate below which it sounds like crap</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.110" end="00:18:14.900" style="s2">and above which it&#39;s basically like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting next to me we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.900" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">a you know anything beyond that is gravy</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a hard transition point where</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:23.659" style="s2">we have enough bandwidth to create a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.159" style="s2">distributed you know Scot thousand</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.659" end="00:18:27.110" style="s2">plateaus and seven and a half billion</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.159" end="00:18:29.900" style="s2">plateaus we can create this virtuality</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.110" end="00:18:32.030" style="s2">and now we&#39;re in a space of attentional</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.900" end="00:18:34.010" style="s2">scarcity so I think it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.030" end="00:18:35.750" style="s2">different thing yeah and in fact I got I</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.010" end="00:18:37.700" style="s2">got a really long discussion with a guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.750" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">who was asking as I was talking about my</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.700" end="00:18:40.520" style="s2">ideas for decentralized web and things</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">like that he was saying you know all</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.520" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">this stuff out social media how is this</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">different than all the piece of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.750" end="00:18:47.419" style="s2">people were saying about TV back in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:49.070" style="s2">day right people are say TV would rot</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.419" end="00:18:51.320" style="s2">your brain Neil postman hat is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.070" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">amusing ourselves to death block people</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.320" end="00:18:55.559" style="s2">said the same stuff about TV why is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">different out social media I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.559" end="00:18:58.980" style="s2">prince is that there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.019" style="s2">things but number one we&#39;re just in a</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.019" end="00:19:04.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not broadcast it&#39;s not broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:07.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.830" end="00:19:08.970" style="s2">TV and radio and newsprint at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.110" end="00:19:10.980" style="s2">their power came from broadcast they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.970" end="00:19:12.600" style="s2">influence a billion or a million minds</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.980" end="00:19:14.370" style="s2">but it was the same message going to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.600" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">same million what we have now is</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:21.299" style="s2">so every single person can get a deeply</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.799" end="00:19:28.980" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a learning issue where this</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.980" end="00:19:32.879" style="s2">growing up with all this stuff they will</p>

<p begin="00:19:36.149" end="00:19:40.470" style="s2">of malware but we have a long way to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.309" end="00:19:41.940" style="s2">before then and number two who knows of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.470" end="00:19:43.350" style="s2">the world will look like by then that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.940" end="00:19:44.940" style="s2">all of their interactions with each</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.350" end="00:19:47.399" style="s2">other the human human interface is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.940" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">already going to be intermediated by so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.399" end="00:19:52.769" style="s2">much virtuality a digital modification</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:54.419" style="s2">we may really be putting ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.769" end="00:19:54.809" style="s2">a new phase of human evolution and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.419" end="00:19:56.490" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.809" end="00:19:57.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve not contemplated really what that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.490" end="00:20:00.389" style="s2">looks like structurally what that means</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.990" end="00:20:01.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s very dangerous I&#39;m gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.389" end="00:20:04.440" style="s2">back to that a little bit later let me</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.950" end="00:20:05.820" style="s2">push back just a little a year ago when</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.440" end="00:20:08.639" style="s2">they when it first started getting some</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.820" end="00:20:11.249" style="s2">publicity I became very concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.639" end="00:20:13.769" style="s2">the possibility of deep fake videos</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.249" end="00:20:16.200" style="s2">being used for very pernicious purposes</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.769" end="00:20:17.850" style="s2">and yet as far as I know there are zero</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.200" end="00:20:19.889" style="s2">examples or you know they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.850" end="00:20:21.690" style="s2">little corner cases but no major</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.889" end="00:20:24.450" style="s2">exploits have been made around deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.690" end="00:20:27.299" style="s2">fakes and that at least to me indicates</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.450" end="00:20:30.389" style="s2">perhaps that people are developing these</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.299" end="00:20:32.639" style="s2">anti-malware immune systems and say you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.389" end="00:20:34.470" style="s2">know that really is in Hillary&#39;s face on</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.639" end="00:20:37.110" style="s2">that porn video right that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.470" end="00:20:38.490" style="s2">implausible right and isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.110" end="00:20:41.340" style="s2">interesting that all this concern about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.490" end="00:20:44.129" style="s2">deep fakes a year ago has so far at</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.340" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">least not been met by actual problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.129" end="00:20:47.399" style="s2">from deep fakes it is interesting I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:48.929" style="s2">also concerned about it you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.399" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">actually when D face first came out I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.929" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">went downloaded the you could download</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">the image via BitTorrent it was about</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:56.669" style="s2">like you know two three gays was the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">kind of the software to do it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.669" end="00:20:59.900" style="s2">looking through</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">actually embedded anaconda to install a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.900" end="00:21:04.520" style="s2">tensor fluff and other stuffs I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.380" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m very proud of this kind of but</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.520" end="00:21:07.880" style="s2">um here&#39;s the problem with that point of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.380" end="00:21:11.750" style="s2">view right and I agree with you we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.880" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">not seen profusion of deep faked you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.750" end="00:21:17.300" style="s2">know political whatever takedown videos</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:19.070" style="s2">and stuff like that we are seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.300" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">of it you know we&#39;re seeing social media</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.070" end="00:21:22.670" style="s2">sites and what not having to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:25.000" style="s2">policies around you know is it okay to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.670" end="00:21:28.160" style="s2">take the likeness of a person and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.000" end="00:21:31.340" style="s2">tensorflow it you know or PI torch it on</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.160" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">top of a porn actress and like is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.340" end="00:21:36.890" style="s2">fair use is that art is it slander what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:38.570" style="s2">is it right so we got that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:40.670" style="s2">going on that is happening that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.570" end="00:21:41.990" style="s2">deep fake video but it is happening but</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.670" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">kind of zooming up a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.990" end="00:21:47.240" style="s2">answer your question more broadly I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:49.640" style="s2">think the danger here is that what deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.240" end="00:21:52.550" style="s2">fake represents is it tells us a we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.640" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">almost good enough to be able to use a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.550" end="00:21:58.760" style="s2">pile of GPUs to trick our iconic visual</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:22:01.180" style="s2">perception system which has been very</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.760" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">good that&#39;s a very well honed system and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.180" end="00:22:05.780" style="s2">our proprioceptive system our visual</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:08.510" style="s2">systems these have been honed for a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.780" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">long time and so you know we look at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.510" end="00:22:11.630" style="s2">loved one they raise an eyebrow and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:13.490" style="s2">read a ton of meeting right so these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.630" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">very well honed systems the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.490" end="00:22:17.630" style="s2">can take a bunch of vector hardware and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.900" end="00:22:20.360" style="s2">fool them is like not great it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.630" end="00:22:23.990" style="s2">like good huh but think more deeply than</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.360" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2">this we are actually entering as own</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">you would think still the forensic</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">earlier I&#39;ll just reiterate that we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">getting better at making virtuality that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">exceeds our sort of perceptions of</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.020" end="00:28:13.660" style="s2">are you know a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.010" end="00:28:15.910" style="s2">struggling and desperate financially</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.770" end="00:28:21.550" style="s2">become increasingly weaponized by</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.330" end="00:29:04.659" style="s2">interesting</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:13.960" style="s2">adults had dropped out of high school so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.010" end="00:29:15.549" style="s2">this was not a tickly sophisticated area</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.960" end="00:29:17.110" style="s2">but the people were generally</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.549" end="00:29:19.419" style="s2">hard-working had good values and were</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.700" end="00:29:29.110" style="s2">alone I&#39;ve ever used it right and</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.059" end="00:29:37.570" style="s2">full of right and so they literally</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.250" end="00:29:40.090" style="s2">in some sense are almost speciated out</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.570" end="00:29:41.950" style="s2">out of this this new thing that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.090" end="00:29:43.900" style="s2">all been doing all these years you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.950" end="00:29:45.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing it since I was in my 20s</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.900" end="00:29:47.890" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been doing it continuously so</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.700" end="00:29:49.750" style="s2">maybe a little anomalous for a mid</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.890" end="00:29:52.419" style="s2">boomer but there are a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.750" end="00:29:54.400" style="s2">just aren&#39;t engaged at all or as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.419" end="00:29:56.289" style="s2">point out some who have been burned or</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.400" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">disgusted and become information</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.289" end="00:30:00.520" style="s2">nihilists with respect to the networks</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">and frankly that may be better in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.520" end="00:30:03.970" style="s2">ways and being duped again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">again but it&#39;s a loss of agency it</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:08.380" style="s2">represents a loss of agency and I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:10.659" style="s2">that all nations was a erics great quote</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.380" end="00:30:11.950" style="s2">that a nation is a good people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.659" end="00:30:14.590" style="s2">decided to forget something together</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.950" end="00:30:17.020" style="s2">right we maintain an illusion of</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.020" end="00:30:20.380" style="s2">and all this other stuff it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.429" end="00:30:22.179" style="s2">illusion to maintain but at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.380" end="00:30:24.220" style="s2">the day there is value to having some</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.179" end="00:30:25.480" style="s2">reality behind that illusion and when</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.220" end="00:30:26.710" style="s2">these people opt out of all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.480" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">they&#39;re opting out of the governance</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.710" end="00:30:30.220" style="s2">system that&#39;s why I call them vassals</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:31.630" style="s2">well or they build a governance system</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.220" end="00:30:33.159" style="s2">in a different modality perhaps they</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.630" end="00:30:34.659" style="s2">decide you know what&#39;s on line</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.159" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">we&#39;re only gonna believe what we see</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.659" end="00:30:38.020" style="s2">face to face I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.429" end="00:30:39.490" style="s2">interesting alternative and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.020" end="00:30:42.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably heard me talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.490" end="00:30:44.260" style="s2">the past my distinction between weak</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.260" end="00:30:49.030" style="s2">links which are done face-to-face and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.840" end="00:30:51.490" style="s2">strikes me in the United States at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.030" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">the strong link networks have been under</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.490" end="00:30:55.960" style="s2">invested in in the last 30 years as</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve all been ever so infatuated with</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.960" end="00:30:59.450" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:01.700" style="s2">Clank we look at other places the five</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.450" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">star movement in Italy is a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.700" end="00:31:06.220" style="s2">interesting example it was basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:08.690" style="s2">built around meetup meetup.com</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.220" end="00:31:11.270" style="s2">face-to-face interactions at every scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.690" end="00:31:12.919" style="s2">all over Italy and you know we could see</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.270" end="00:31:14.570" style="s2">that from the rejectionists so yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.919" end="00:31:17.780" style="s2">speciation but doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.570" end="00:31:20.090" style="s2">our species will win okay so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.780" end="00:31:21.320" style="s2">disagree about it don&#39;t agree you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.090" end="00:31:24.020" style="s2">right that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.320" end="00:31:25.250" style="s2">our species will win whatever our means</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.020" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">like I don&#39;t disagree with you about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.250" end="00:31:28.909" style="s2">strong versus weak links and and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:30.289" style="s2">I would say that the past thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.909" end="00:31:32.270" style="s2">of what you say the past thirty years of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.289" end="00:31:34.220" style="s2">underinvestment in strong links I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.270" end="00:31:35.900" style="s2">that was your your phrasing I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.220" end="00:31:38.299" style="s2">actually that&#39;s your touching your</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.900" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">brushing up against the root problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.299" end="00:31:42.500" style="s2">here and you know where Vicky talks</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.909" style="s2">about the crisis of meaning and the this</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.500" end="00:31:45.380" style="s2">last thirty years has been more than</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.909" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">that I actually say it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.380" end="00:31:50.390" style="s2">closer to about sixty years and I peg it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:53.690" style="s2">to basically the post war in America and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.390" end="00:31:56.450" style="s2">the beginning of really mass media</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.690" end="00:31:58.429" style="s2">driving mass consumption and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.450" end="00:32:01.250" style="s2">happened is that every single step we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.429" end="00:32:02.929" style="s2">removed we&#39;ve been weakening communalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.250" end="00:32:04.700" style="s2">and community strong links between</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.929" end="00:32:06.500" style="s2">people and then we&#39;ve been replacing</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.700" end="00:32:08.679" style="s2">those sources of meaning and those</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.500" end="00:32:10.820" style="s2">interactions with interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.679" end="00:32:13.010" style="s2">celebrities brands things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.820" end="00:32:14.990" style="s2">delivered to us in a broadcast fashion</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.010" end="00:32:17.720" style="s2">and even with you haven&#39;t of that from</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.990" end="00:32:20.600" style="s2">radio and local FM stations getting you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.720" end="00:32:22.730" style="s2">know snapped up same cable TV that went</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.600" end="00:32:25.220" style="s2">from community local to being global</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.730" end="00:32:28.820" style="s2">broadcast Turner right and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.220" end="00:32:33.320" style="s2">this broadcast mass media phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.820" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">that has essentially destroyed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.320" end="00:32:38.360" style="s2">that person-to-person in-person sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.830" style="s2">thing and I think that the strong link</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.360" end="00:32:41.780" style="s2">system is the strongly breakdown that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.830" end="00:32:44.210" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s well maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.780" end="00:32:46.309" style="s2">intentional but it&#39;s been an active</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.210" end="00:32:47.929" style="s2">thing it wasn&#39;t like oh shoot we forgot</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.309" end="00:32:49.730" style="s2">we were supposed to see other people no</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.929" end="00:32:52.220" style="s2">it was hey your kids should watch more</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.730" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">TV hey did you see that TV show usually</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.220" end="00:32:55.220" style="s2">read through the newspaper the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:56.780" style="s2">newspapers talking about the stars on</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.220" end="00:32:59.060" style="s2">this new TV show this pilot</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.780" end="00:33:02.930" style="s2">showed like all of us are tuned in to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.060" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">broadcast mass media and that by itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.930" end="00:33:08.060" style="s2">has been a deeply weakening thing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:10.070" style="s2">when you talk about the people doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.060" end="00:33:11.450" style="s2">face-to-face connections as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.070" end="00:33:12.860" style="s2">building movements I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.450" end="00:33:16.160" style="s2">fantastic that&#39;s true and correct</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.860" end="00:33:18.530" style="s2">however however I think that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.160" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">stuff if it&#39;s actively being competed</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.530" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">against by the digitally networked and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:25.610" style="s2">digital mimetic systems it doesn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:28.280" style="s2">a candle yep this is why I what I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.610" end="00:33:31.160" style="s2">speak towards is a hybrid of strong link</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.280" end="00:33:33.770" style="s2">nodes linked by weak links right so they</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.160" end="00:33:36.380" style="s2">can coordinate and sense make using weak</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.770" end="00:33:38.390" style="s2">links and act using strong links and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.380" end="00:33:40.370" style="s2">getting that architecture I mean those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.390" end="00:33:42.050" style="s2">are just words getting that architecture</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.370" end="00:33:43.730" style="s2">right where you take the benefits of</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.360" end="00:33:54.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m aware of but I put it out there</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.310" end="00:33:56.930" style="s2">as a challenge for you know movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.470" end="00:33:59.390" style="s2">builders party builders you know mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.930" end="00:34:01.370" style="s2">warfare people to take that combined</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.390" end="00:34:03.020" style="s2">idea and see what you can make out of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.370" end="00:34:04.490" style="s2">yeah I agree with you but I would I</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.020" end="00:34:06.890" style="s2">would just push back on that concept of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.490" end="00:34:08.870" style="s2">it being a winning strategy because that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.890" end="00:34:10.610" style="s2">explicitly sets up and maybe you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.870" end="00:34:11.810" style="s2">really saying this but when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.610" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">about this being a winning strategy it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.810" end="00:34:14.120" style="s2">almost sounds like there&#39;s a goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:18.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing we&#39;re trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.120" end="00:34:19.940" style="s2">and this would be a way to win it but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.110" end="00:34:22.700" style="s2">want to be very clear that when we say</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.940" end="00:34:25.070" style="s2">that we&#39;re not this is a really very</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.700" end="00:34:27.050" style="s2">difficult thing to articulate I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.070" end="00:34:28.940" style="s2">you&#39;re right that in a state that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.050" end="00:34:30.649" style="s2">and I would be happy to see would be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.940" end="00:34:33.860" style="s2">system that could be described by that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.649" end="00:34:35.600" style="s2">description but the goal wasn&#39;t to win</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:38.390" style="s2">the goal right now is to create a better</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.600" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">architecture for humans to build shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.390" end="00:34:43.220" style="s2">values and shared meaning and so Joe</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.669" end="00:34:50.810" style="s2">approaches and so even though I agree</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.669" end="00:34:52.280" style="s2">with you from a phenomenological</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.280" end="00:34:56.540" style="s2">looks like I want to make sure that we</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.210" end="00:35:08.190" style="s2">it&#39;s more about having communities where</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.190" end="00:35:11.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have right now right we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.510" end="00:35:13.410" style="s2">of individuals we&#39;re sort of I think a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.130" end="00:35:14.970" style="s2">peak individualism the mass media stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.410" end="00:35:16.380" style="s2">is played into that very well and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.380" end="00:35:19.950" style="s2">I think that was very well said Peter</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.119" end="00:35:21.600" style="s2">and maybe I will rip off that a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.950" end="00:35:24.570" style="s2">bit yeah that&#39;s idea this weakling</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.600" end="00:35:29.330" style="s2">strong link community when I say winning</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.570" end="00:35:32.100" style="s2">let&#39;s say wins enough to build a safe</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.330" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">ecosystem to develop an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.100" end="00:35:36.420" style="s2">the status quo where people living</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.420" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">basically reject the game a programming</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.090" end="00:35:43.230" style="s2">and have a space in which they can build</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:45.780" style="s2">game B and you know we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.230" end="00:35:49.020" style="s2">game B is yet but we know that it avoids</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.780" end="00:35:52.350" style="s2">many of the pernicious aspects of game a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.020" end="00:35:54.450" style="s2">and to my mind that&#39;s winning yeah so by</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.350" end="00:35:56.820" style="s2">that definition than avoiding game a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.450" end="00:35:58.619" style="s2">failures we can pound define that as</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.820" end="00:36:01.020" style="s2">game be winning with that I would agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.619" end="00:36:03.600" style="s2">all right let&#39;s hop back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.020" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">here to you know fake news networks etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.600" end="00:36:09.690" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s very different big</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:12.570" style="s2">difference between 1975 and today is in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.690" end="00:36:15.450" style="s2">1975 there were a very small number</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.570" end="00:36:18.030" style="s2">really a very homogeneous gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.450" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">there were the three TV networks there</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.030" end="00:36:21.300" style="s2">were frankly a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:24.119" style="s2">newspapers New York Times Washington</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.300" end="00:36:26.580" style="s2">Post&#39;s LA Times Chicago Tribune that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.119" end="00:36:29.010" style="s2">drove the news agenda there was Newsweek</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.580" end="00:36:32.609" style="s2">and Time magazine and so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.010" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">very narrow choice of views of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.609" end="00:36:37.230" style="s2">now this had some big negatives I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.820" style="s2">frankly the idea that de libération</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.230" end="00:36:41.490" style="s2">would have happened under that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.820" end="00:36:43.050" style="s2">system is relatively unlikely in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.490" end="00:36:45.240" style="s2">other good things that have come from</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.050" end="00:36:46.740" style="s2">the breakdown of the control of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.240" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">discourse by a small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.740" end="00:36:52.650" style="s2">but at the same time having those small</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">number of professional quality discourse</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.650" end="00:36:56.300" style="s2">mediators also kept out a lot of general</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.859" style="s2">horseshit you know stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.300" end="00:37:00.540" style="s2">anti-vaxxers and flat earths and god</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.859" end="00:37:03.750" style="s2">knows what other crap circulates around</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.540" end="00:37:05.880" style="s2">our unmediated networks today so seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.750" end="00:37:09.600" style="s2">to me that what we really are in need of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.880" end="00:37:12.600" style="s2">is a new synthesis or we can get some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.600" end="00:37:14.420" style="s2">the quality of mediation discourse</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.600" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">filtering</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.420" end="00:37:19.789" style="s2">etc that we used to get from this</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">handful of big bland mediators but</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.789" end="00:37:25.339" style="s2">instead is dynamic and small scale and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:27.230" style="s2">fractal and emergent and all those good</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.339" end="00:37:29.390" style="s2">things you know sometimes that goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.230" end="00:37:32.660" style="s2">under the name of sense making you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.390" end="00:37:34.430" style="s2">we need to learn how to exist in a world</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.660" end="00:37:37.309" style="s2">where there isn&#39;t a small number of Big</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.430" end="00:37:39.319" style="s2">Brother mediators yet still have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.309" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">lot of the useless crap filtered out</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.319" end="00:37:44.450" style="s2">that we otherwise would waste our</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.130" style="s2">attention on yes I mean I do say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:48.109" style="s2">but when I talk about what what I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.130" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">we really need to do we need a new</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.109" end="00:37:52.760" style="s2">infrastructure for sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:55.069" style="s2">meaning making and really collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.760" end="00:37:56.510" style="s2">collective action but since making is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.069" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">the first part of the collective action</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.510" end="00:38:00.380" style="s2">could you define sense making this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:02.660" style="s2">word that gets thrown around a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.380" end="00:38:05.990" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear what your take on what</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.660" end="00:38:07.849" style="s2">it means is well the way I think about</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.250" end="00:41:51.640" style="s2">we&#39;re essentially talking about the</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:58.780" style="s2">thinking right the Enlightenment was the</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.940" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">made up and instead attempting to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">sense that was actually congruent with</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">reality and yes I&#39;ll put my metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.760" style="s2">cards on the table and admit to being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:14.710" style="s2">naive realist I actually believe there</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.760" end="00:42:16.570" style="s2">is a single reality and we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.710" end="00:42:17.980" style="s2">more and more about it though I doubt we</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.570" end="00:42:20.440" style="s2">can ever learn everything about it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.980" end="00:42:23.560" style="s2">that the Enlightenment toolkit was all</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.440" end="00:42:26.440" style="s2">about sense making to bring our models</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.560" end="00:42:29.950" style="s2">as congruent as possible to that reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.440" end="00:42:31.990" style="s2">and it is a little disconcerting that on</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.950" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">both the left and the right or seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.990" end="00:42:34.990" style="s2">people explicitly pull away from the</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.990" end="00:42:38.590" style="s2">as a core value and retreating to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.540" end="00:42:40.330" style="s2">know I&#39;ll just be happy to believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.590" end="00:42:42.070" style="s2">horseshit that it&#39;s been handed down</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.330" end="00:42:43.420" style="s2">through the generations because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.070" end="00:42:46.360" style="s2">horseshit that I feel comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.420" end="00:42:49.330" style="s2">and that strikes me as exceedingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.360" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">dangerous and very counterproductive for</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.330" end="00:42:52.810" style="s2">the future of the human race now in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:54.340" style="s2">terms of how this might actually work I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.810" end="00:42:57.700" style="s2">had an example today might you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.340" end="00:42:59.980" style="s2">mentioned my hometown buddies we go</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.700" end="00:43:02.440" style="s2">hunting we go fishing we go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.980" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">crazy a few times a year they know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.440" end="00:43:05.740" style="s2">that I&#39;m well-connected into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.090" end="00:43:09.460" style="s2">networks and have reasonably good sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.740" end="00:43:11.410" style="s2">making skills and also other nodes near</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.460" end="00:43:12.940" style="s2">me I got an email today from a friend</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.410" end="00:43:14.830" style="s2">asking me is this real or is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.940" end="00:43:17.230" style="s2"> right had to do with something</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.830" end="00:43:19.060" style="s2">to do with gun control and the federal</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.230" end="00:43:21.250" style="s2">government or something I did five</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.060" end="00:43:24.630" style="s2">minutes with a research and I said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.250" end="00:43:26.680" style="s2">this is real and it does seem somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.630" end="00:43:28.630" style="s2">unprecedented so yes this is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.680" end="00:43:30.670" style="s2">you should pay attention to so as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.630" end="00:43:32.980" style="s2">started thinking about that as uh you</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.670" end="00:43:35.530" style="s2">know just a very baby example one might</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.980" end="00:43:36.850" style="s2">think of sense-making being in small to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.530" end="00:43:38.500" style="s2">medium sized groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.850" end="00:43:40.630" style="s2">interconnected across</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.500" end="00:43:43.980" style="s2">call him secretary nodes kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.630" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">the secretaries of Correspondence in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.980" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">Continental Congress and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:50.530" style="s2">pre-revolutionary America where every</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">community had our big community had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.530" end="00:43:54.430" style="s2">group of pre revolutionaries and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:56.890" style="s2">had a corresponding secretary who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.430" end="00:43:58.780" style="s2">to the other nodes right and so my buddy</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.890" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">asked me I asked somebody else right he</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.780" end="00:44:03.579" style="s2">to the research and he now has my power</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.380" style="s2">at least at second hand to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.579" end="00:44:08.020" style="s2">some random thing that came in over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.380" end="00:44:10.690" style="s2">Internet and that may be the model so</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.020" end="00:44:13.240" style="s2">long as there are a sufficient critical</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.690" end="00:44:16.660" style="s2">mass of Enlightenment thinkers in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.240" end="00:44:18.310" style="s2">connected network that a person is part</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.660" end="00:44:20.260" style="s2">of that provides their sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.310" end="00:44:22.359" style="s2">apparatus yeah I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.260" end="00:44:25.060" style="s2">wholeheartedly and I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.359" end="00:44:26.770" style="s2">the thing you talk about there I also in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.060" end="00:44:28.810" style="s2">my own conference lightning talk that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.770" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">gave a couple years back I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.810" end="00:44:33.460" style="s2">the difference between a human network</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:36.790" style="s2">forces a computer network and a human</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.460" end="00:44:39.400" style="s2">network the intelligence actually is in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.790" end="00:44:41.290" style="s2">the network in in that it&#39;s a trusted</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.400" end="00:44:43.060" style="s2">network there is there&#39;s trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.290" end="00:44:46.119" style="s2">connection so your friend if they got an</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.060" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">email from me or from you know Joe Schmo</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.119" end="00:44:49.960" style="s2">saying yeah this thing is real they</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:51.430" style="s2">would discount it completely but if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.960" end="00:44:53.619" style="s2">get it from you they believe you right</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.430" end="00:44:55.810" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s you that connection</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.619" end="00:44:57.099" style="s2">itself you know trusted connection is 90</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.810" end="00:44:59.740" style="s2">percent of the signal doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.099" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">what it says on that wire actually right</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.740" end="00:45:04.030" style="s2">it so strongly modulates the signal</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:06.040" style="s2">going down that connection but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.030" end="00:45:07.810" style="s2">Internet is very interesting right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.040" end="00:45:10.119" style="s2">says you know as well or probably better</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.810" end="00:45:12.010" style="s2">than most the Internet is just this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.119" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">ossified frozen you call it frozen</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.010" end="00:45:15.130" style="s2">accident i think is great term it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:17.140" style="s2">frozen accident of a command-and-control</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.130" end="00:45:18.970" style="s2">computer network where the network&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.140" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">supposed to be dumb where trust was not</p>

<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:27.160" style="s2">network right back in the day and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:29.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve overlaid our expectations and our</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.890" end="00:45:34.710" style="s2">network we use is a human network but</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.089" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">very very hard to surface in a scalable</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.970" end="00:46:03.960" style="s2">way you know the human networks are very</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.960" end="00:46:07.349" style="s2">so I think in the long run we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:09.480" style="s2">sense-making networks that look more</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.349" end="00:46:11.790" style="s2">like these organic human networks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.480" end="00:46:13.580" style="s2">my hope and just as a sidebar I have</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.790" end="00:46:15.750" style="s2">talked about this a lot that our</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.810" end="00:46:31.320" style="s2">were all designed for you know</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.500" end="00:46:53.640" style="s2">and again this is where I come back to</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.310" end="00:47:02.580" style="s2">about it as a fractal Network where it</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.070" end="00:47:04.080" style="s2">can scale in smaller nodes right so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.580" end="00:47:07.020" style="s2">know let&#39;s say it&#39;s a community of a</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.030" end="00:47:12.270" style="s2">amongst them but some of the members</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.589" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">that network also reached out to other</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.270" end="00:47:16.589" style="s2">Dunbar clusters right so that when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.119" style="s2">aggregate up you eventually get to the</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.660" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2">to go yeah and actually I sorta clarify</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.580" end="00:47:27.089" style="s2">when I say the word scale I think it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:28.680" style="s2">actually can scale and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.089" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">reasons I say that the biggest social</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.680" end="00:47:32.010" style="s2">network and the most resilient social</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:33.960" style="s2">network in the world is still email but</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.010" end="00:47:35.820" style="s2">actually the scale that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.960" end="00:47:38.280" style="s2">about there I should have err quoted it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.820" end="00:47:40.830" style="s2">what I mean is scalable in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.280" end="00:47:43.109" style="s2">modern like vc-backed to scale</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.830" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">monetization model kinds of things I</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.109" end="00:47:47.500" style="s2">think that these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:49.300" style="s2">it may very well be the case that really</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.500" end="00:47:52.450" style="s2">good is humane communication</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.300" end="00:47:55.210" style="s2">technologies almost by design cannot be</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.210" end="00:47:58.600" style="s2">monetized now they the business models</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.340" end="00:48:00.850" style="s2">around them are not scalable even though</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.600" end="00:48:03.010" style="s2">the networks and the meaning making is I</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.850" end="00:48:05.650" style="s2">love that distinction and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.010" end="00:48:07.960" style="s2">actually that may point us in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.650" end="00:48:09.580" style="s2">of where to be thinking right don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.960" end="00:48:11.350" style="s2">think in terms of yeah I gotta build</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.580" end="00:48:12.970" style="s2">another unicorn that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.350" end="00:48:15.100" style="s2">this week I built it let me build a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.970" end="00:48:17.110" style="s2">third one you know them unicorns</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.100" end="00:48:21.190" style="s2">right instead let&#39;s solve the actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.110" end="00:48:23.320" style="s2">human problem of how can people do sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.190" end="00:48:25.360" style="s2">making of reasonable high fidelity even</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.320" end="00:48:27.700" style="s2">if they personally don&#39;t have huge sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.360" end="00:48:30.490" style="s2">making skills how do we allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.700" end="00:48:33.780" style="s2">find their advisers or how they create a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.490" end="00:48:36.280" style="s2">virtual set of advisers from a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.780" end="00:48:38.260" style="s2">relatively small number may be Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.280" end="00:48:40.360" style="s2">number ish set of network connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.260" end="00:48:42.490" style="s2">how they discover how they knit that up</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.360" end="00:48:44.290" style="s2">yeah and I think the closest we got to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.490" end="00:48:45.400" style="s2">something like this was in the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.290" end="00:48:48.040" style="s2">kind of this like a period of a few</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.400" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">years you know I think the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.040" end="00:48:53.170" style="s2">maybe when the Internet we got rich</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">enough to have like embedded audio and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.170" end="00:48:57.550" style="s2">video kinds of things and some flash</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:59.650" style="s2">animation stuff and we then had web</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.550" end="00:49:01.990" style="s2">rings we had web rings out the wazoo</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.650" end="00:49:04.320" style="s2">right I remember those are actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.990" end="00:49:06.430" style="s2">pretty cool yeah there&#39;s a evolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.320" end="00:49:08.410" style="s2">Darwinism right bring Amazon and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.430" end="00:49:11.490" style="s2">like a Babylon 5 web ring and all these</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.410" end="00:49:14.080" style="s2">things those are great that&#39;s organic</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.490" end="00:49:16.330" style="s2">socialization happening and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.080" end="00:49:18.550" style="s2">about this is I think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.330" end="00:49:20.560" style="s2">forgotten we forgotten just how</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.550" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">powerfully leveraged an activity</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.560" end="00:49:27.610" style="s2">software development really is and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:29.380" style="s2">in the last 20 years the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.610" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">software especially enterprise software</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.380" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">the fact of people get employed</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.250" end="00:49:40.180" style="s2">build like we have so much financial</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.180" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">essentially pretty crummy software that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.790" end="00:49:47.410" style="s2">we forgot that software actually is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:48.550" style="s2">quite leveraged as an activity and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.410" end="00:49:50.020" style="s2">tell two little stories about one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.550" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">them is when we talk about in the open</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.020" end="00:49:54.460" style="s2">source world the sustainability crisis</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.390" end="00:50:18.410" style="s2">part-time and so when we talk about the</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.410" end="00:50:21.500" style="s2">you know we can wring your hands about</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.500" end="00:50:24.859" style="s2">these people very well but if you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:27.290" style="s2">what the flip side of that how many</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.859" end="00:50:29.690" style="s2">billions of dollars of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.290" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">value hasn&#39;t provided by just a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:33.740" style="s2">people in their part-time like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:35.960" style="s2">kind of amazing right do you imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.740" end="00:50:38.420" style="s2">you went back to the Middle Ages again</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.460" end="00:51:10.910" style="s2">much and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.809" end="00:51:12.650" style="s2">we&#39;re building on sand well we have a</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.979" end="00:53:17.880" style="s2">terrible like you know when we look at</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.520" end="01:00:12.180" style="s2">but this is one example right when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.110" end="01:00:16.380" style="s2">because you said the mp3 file I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.180" end="01:00:18.450" style="s2">say that for me my view on economics is</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.380" end="01:00:19.740" style="s2">if from the perspective of dilettante</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.450" end="01:00:21.030" style="s2">and amateur I mean you know I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.740" end="01:00:24.420" style="s2">a degree in the stuff earning like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.030" end="01:00:27.090" style="s2">but so as far as I can tell economics as</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.420" end="01:00:28.710" style="s2">an activity for you know trade of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.090" end="01:00:31.860" style="s2">specialization around the route aspects</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.710" end="01:00:33.900" style="s2">of economics and those two fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.220" end="01:00:43.130" style="s2">give rise to non rivalries there</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.280" end="01:00:45.860" style="s2">dynamics that it&#39;s almost worth asking</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.130" end="01:00:48.260" style="s2">is the term non-rival risk economics is</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.860" end="01:00:50.570" style="s2">that term itself an oxymoron that is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.260" end="01:00:53.000" style="s2">say you know is economics really as we</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.570" end="01:00:54.980" style="s2">think about it fundamentally only useful</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.000" end="01:00:58.250" style="s2">we have these rival as scarce or</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.980" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">scarcity mentality things and if we move</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.250" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">into the metaphysical space where non</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">rival as things can happen and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.300" style="s2">predominantly it&#39;s non rival really is</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:06.650" style="s2">happening is that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.300" end="01:01:08.330" style="s2">economics at all is it more about</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.650" end="01:01:11.870" style="s2">coherence and resonance is it more about</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.330" end="01:01:13.130" style="s2">you know phase resonance and phase you</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.870" end="01:01:14.690" style="s2">know constructive and destructive</p>

<p begin="01:01:14.690" end="01:01:18.200" style="s2">you know maybe those are better terms</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.190" end="01:01:19.910" style="s2">frankly I guess I don&#39;t really care what</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.200" end="01:01:22.730" style="s2">we call it right I would still say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.910" end="01:01:25.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the technology or to the toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.730" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">for creation and distribution and yes we</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.700" end="01:01:31.100" style="s2">call it economics in game a but there</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:34.970" style="s2">has to be an analogous toolkit that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.100" end="01:01:37.700" style="s2">coherent for an alternative mechanism to</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.970" end="01:01:39.530" style="s2">emerge and whether you call it economics</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.700" end="01:01:41.030" style="s2">you call it something else I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.530" end="01:01:42.410" style="s2">really care you know there are some</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.030" end="01:01:44.930" style="s2">people have done some you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.410" end="01:01:47.720" style="s2">interesting work on analogues to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.930" end="01:01:49.190" style="s2">economics in you know the game be or an</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.720" end="01:01:50.930" style="s2">alternative world in for instance you</p>

<p begin="01:01:54.320" end="01:01:58.940" style="s2">future economics is a good place for</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.540" end="01:02:01.640" style="s2">people to start right yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.940" end="01:02:04.310" style="s2">the reason I bring that up is just</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.640" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">because the way I see it viscerally kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.310" end="01:02:07.640" style="s2">of where I have to deal with the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:10.190" style="s2">on a very practical level is in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.640" end="01:02:12.770" style="s2">intersection of the open-source software</p>

<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:21.590" style="s2">the business world still thinks about</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.610" end="01:02:24.380" style="s2">software artifacts as being valuable it</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.590" end="01:02:28.030" style="s2">still thinks about its employees on the</p>

<p begin="01:02:28.030" end="01:02:33.740" style="s2">when we look at what&#39;s made the open</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.580" end="01:02:35.390" style="s2">source software movement successful the</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.740" end="01:02:37.640" style="s2">values are completely different the</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.940" end="01:02:44.300" style="s2">values so I think if we really want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.460" end="01:02:46.820" style="s2">pull this</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.300" end="01:02:49.460" style="s2">to the metaphysical basis there&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:03:09.170" end="01:03:12.620" style="s2">interaction dynamics we can abstract</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.310" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">outside of that then maybe we have the</p>

<p begin="01:03:18.320" end="01:03:22.310" style="s2">that is a very deeply human interview</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.450" end="01:03:24.290" style="s2">man kind of activity currently I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.310" end="01:03:26.300" style="s2">talking about open source you know one</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.290" end="01:03:28.910" style="s2">signal and it&#39;s not a fungible signal</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.300" end="01:03:31.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a completely differentiated signal</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.910" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">is the reputational signal from working</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.850" end="01:03:35.810" style="s2">on an important or even an unimportant</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">open source project you know as part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.810" end="01:03:38.540" style="s2">a part of your resume and I certainly</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:40.610" style="s2">impresses me when I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.540" end="01:03:42.950" style="s2">somebody you know I was a contributor to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.610" end="01:03:44.840" style="s2">Project X for the last seven years right</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.950" end="01:03:46.580" style="s2">not only does that show that they know</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.840" end="01:03:48.440" style="s2">how to you know deal with other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.580" end="01:03:50.150" style="s2">but I they&#39;ve actually pointed me to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.440" end="01:03:52.040" style="s2">significant body of their work that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.150" end="01:03:54.410" style="s2">can go take a look at so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.040" end="01:03:56.810" style="s2">example of signaling but does not use a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.410" end="01:03:59.180" style="s2">fungible token maybe that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.810" end="01:04:02.300" style="s2">forward is thing is realizing that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.180" end="01:04:04.940" style="s2">signaling may not be in terms of simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.300" end="01:04:06.650" style="s2">tokens yeah I mean because at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.940" end="01:04:09.440" style="s2">the day bunch of the fungible token</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.650" end="01:04:11.630" style="s2">aspect of economics is just there to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.440" end="01:04:14.380" style="s2">scale transactions beyond the zone of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.630" end="01:04:17.030" style="s2">trust right because if you&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.380" end="01:04:19.160" style="s2">cows and chickens for fishes and fish</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.030" end="01:04:21.290" style="s2">nets your zone of trust is like your</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.160" end="01:04:23.060" style="s2">clan or a tribe level but if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.290" end="01:04:24.920" style="s2">trade you know silks with people across</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.060" end="01:04:28.070" style="s2">the mountains you got to have something</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.920" end="01:04:29.570" style="s2">else right so the tokenization is way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.070" end="01:04:32.840" style="s2">scaling transactions beyond trust</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.570" end="01:04:35.150" style="s2">barriers is fine but that&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.840" end="01:04:36.500" style="s2">useful when it comes to these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.150" end="01:04:38.840" style="s2">activities it&#39;s almost like every</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.500" end="01:04:40.460" style="s2">project has its own kind of token every</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.840" end="01:04:42.800" style="s2">person has their own kind of token right</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.460" end="01:04:45.260" style="s2">if you get a thumbs up and it actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.800" end="01:04:47.060" style="s2">our software systems they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.260" end="01:04:48.350" style="s2">don&#39;t create affordances</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.060" end="01:04:50.210" style="s2">for this actually it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.350" end="01:04:51.710" style="s2">unfortunate like you look at a project</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.210" end="01:04:54.560" style="s2">like oh this get a project only has</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.710" end="01:04:57.080" style="s2">three stars another one has 10,000 stars</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.560" end="01:04:58.340" style="s2">right but the ones the what 10,000 stars</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.080" end="01:05:00.110" style="s2">some professors taught a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.340" end="01:05:02.390" style="s2">students they all thumbs up his project</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.110" end="01:05:04.280" style="s2">but this one three stars it&#39;s like guido</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.390" end="01:05:05.960" style="s2">van rossum and linus torvalds and like</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.280" end="01:05:07.700" style="s2">you know somebody else you know some big</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.960" end="01:05:08.930" style="s2">computer science person well guess what</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.700" end="01:05:10.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the restart project it&#39;s worth a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.930" end="01:05:12.200" style="s2">whole lot more right so these</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.190" end="01:05:14.060" style="s2">reputational systems are I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.200" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">certainly a way forward but I wonder you</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.060" end="01:05:18.950" style="s2">know I do wonder if there&#39;s better ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:20.540" style="s2">that we can scale interactions you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.950" end="01:05:23.420" style="s2">beyond the simple naive web of trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.540" end="01:05:25.310" style="s2">model but I don&#39;t know it&#39;s early an</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.420" end="01:05:27.950" style="s2">area where there&#39;s a crying need for</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.310" end="01:05:29.870" style="s2">innovation think about an emergent</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.950" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">bottom-up filter that could be there on</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.870" end="01:05:34.100" style="s2">Facebook one of the things that drives</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:38.090" style="s2">me crazy is that Facebook provides no</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.100" end="01:05:40.460" style="s2">real tools for nuance full response to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.090" end="01:05:42.980" style="s2">content that flows by you know I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.460" end="01:05:44.810" style="s2">to put every piece of code on everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.980" end="01:05:47.210" style="s2">that either pissed me off or I really</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.810" end="01:05:49.370" style="s2">liked I&#39;d like to place them in you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.210" end="01:05:52.550" style="s2">some two-dimensional space of quality</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.370" end="01:05:54.830" style="s2">and importance right and if Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.550" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">just allowed that and then use a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.830" end="01:06:00.200" style="s2">bit of tools for smartly aggregate them</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:02.660" style="s2">and doing some commutative structure</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.200" end="01:06:04.820" style="s2">across those we could tune up a much</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.660" end="01:06:06.350" style="s2">better flow of what we saw than this</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.820" end="01:06:10.040" style="s2">current crazy world where the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.350" end="01:06:13.910" style="s2">signal is like like all right oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.040" end="01:06:15.740" style="s2">I mean I this could be a whole series of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.910" end="01:06:20.020" style="s2">podcasts because the thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.740" end="01:06:23.570" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand just how much a</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.020" end="01:06:26.660" style="s2">little bit of a software tweak can have</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.570" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">an absolutely massive impact on the</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.570" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">infrastructure is such an odds thing is</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.330" end="01:06:36.050" style="s2">such a nuance thing and then we just</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2">have like interns go and try this and</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.050" end="01:06:39.380" style="s2">try that it&#39;s absolutely it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.000" end="01:06:40.700" style="s2">know what kind of malpractice it is but</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.380" end="01:06:42.290" style="s2">it&#39;s some kind of malpractice I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.700" end="01:06:43.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s ridiculous you talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.290" end="01:06:45.500" style="s2">things that we all like to see on</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.130" end="01:06:47.150" style="s2">Facebook there&#39;s so many things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.500" end="01:06:48.800" style="s2">so many things we can do on Twitter or</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.150" end="01:06:50.090" style="s2">Facebook that would you know they took</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.800" end="01:06:52.790" style="s2">Twitter was still talking about hiding</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.090" end="01:06:54.050" style="s2">retweets and likes right as a thing you</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.790" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">think about that right or if</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.050" end="01:06:59.420" style="s2">you added a downvote button or a dislike</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:07:01.790" style="s2">button right or if you had simply</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.420" end="01:07:03.320" style="s2">socialized k files so every single</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.790" end="01:07:05.570" style="s2">person on Twitter has the ability to add</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.320" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">block lists and turn on essentially some</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.570" end="01:07:10.250" style="s2">weight of all of the people they follow</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:12.620" style="s2">their block lists that would instantly</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.250" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">instantly change dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.620" end="01:07:16.520" style="s2">virality on Twitter but of course it</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:17.510" style="s2">would screw up their evaluation but it</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.520" end="01:07:19.040" style="s2">would create a much better</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.510" end="01:07:20.540" style="s2">conversational space and all these</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.040" end="01:07:22.430" style="s2">different tools all these tweaks free</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.540" end="01:07:24.770" style="s2">but we might use they what what they</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.430" end="01:07:27.800" style="s2">would do is they would give the end user</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.770" end="01:07:29.870" style="s2">the ability to participate in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.800" end="01:07:32.390" style="s2">conversation around the norms of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.870" end="01:07:33.620" style="s2">communication space so you know what one</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.390" end="01:07:36.170" style="s2">of the things that I talked about is</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.620" end="01:07:38.060" style="s2">that every interaction between two</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.170" end="01:07:41.210" style="s2">people is a space every conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.060" end="01:07:42.950" style="s2">a space and the space has norms and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.210" end="01:07:44.510" style="s2">problem with the social media platforms</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.950" end="01:07:47.540" style="s2">that we build we call social media there</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.510" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">really attention marketing and virality</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.540" end="01:07:53.090" style="s2">platforms but they&#39;re there too they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:54.980" style="s2">completely unarmed they&#39;re unknown</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.090" end="01:07:58.310" style="s2">spaces which is why it&#39;s so screwed up</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.980" end="01:07:59.570" style="s2">and it&#39;s just deeply again I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.310" end="01:08:01.880" style="s2">what kind of malpractice is I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.570" end="01:08:03.890" style="s2">the term to use in the future we might</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.880" end="01:08:05.870" style="s2">have some you know someone write a PhD</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.890" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">thesis about the nature of harm and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.870" end="01:08:10.730" style="s2">communications and the way that these</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:13.940" style="s2">things are perfect examples of bad</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.730" end="01:08:15.260" style="s2">design but I I don&#39;t know how to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.940" end="01:08:16.940" style="s2">have the worst for right now but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.260" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">something I feel very deeply and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.940" end="01:08:21.740" style="s2">viscerally I had this idea actually last</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:24.049" style="s2">year about putting in a concept of like</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.740" end="01:08:26.030" style="s2">equal time right so we used to have this</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.049" end="01:08:27.470" style="s2">cost of equal time on the airwaves and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.030" end="01:08:28.940" style="s2">now you have places like Twitter and</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.470" end="01:08:30.350" style="s2">people on Twitter with larger followings</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.940" end="01:08:32.420" style="s2">then the broadcast networks used to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.350" end="01:08:34.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s no equal time concept but</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.420" end="01:08:35.450" style="s2">they have the same kind of reach how is</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.160" end="01:08:38.780" style="s2">that right how is that gonna be a good</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.450" end="01:08:42.200" style="s2">thing so you know all these UI&#39;s systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.780" end="01:08:43.819" style="s2">that we build they have so many millions</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.200" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">of variables that we get tune and tweak</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.819" end="01:08:47.630" style="s2">to make for much better for meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:49.310" style="s2">human interaction but none of them are</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.630" end="01:08:51.710" style="s2">incentivized to do this none of them are</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.310" end="01:08:53.510" style="s2">monetized in a way that would be aligned</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.710" end="01:08:56.810" style="s2">with that it&#39;s a really terrible</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.510" end="01:08:58.220" style="s2">situation the unspoken attractor is the</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.220" end="01:09:04.030" style="s2">is selling ads right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.240" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">the world went down that route this kind</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.240" end="01:09:17.230" style="s2">eyeballs times attention times</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.890" end="01:09:17.590" style="s2">excitability and then sell that to</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.590" end="01:09:22.720" style="s2">purse which basically the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.830" end="01:09:24.370" style="s2">model i thought about this a lot but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.720" end="01:09:27.730" style="s2">world really just seems to reject it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.370" end="01:09:29.710" style="s2">suppose we had a discourse platform that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.730" end="01:09:31.720" style="s2">we you had to pay for a little bit five</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.710" end="01:09:33.490" style="s2">dollars a month ten dollars a lot three</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.720" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">offerings essentially a trivial amount</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.490" end="01:09:39.100" style="s2">and it was built on the principle that</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.100" end="01:09:43.060" style="s2">eyeballs or maximize your twitchiness</p>

<p begin="01:09:43.060" end="01:09:47.020" style="s2">from the system what a concept right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.250" end="01:09:49.660" style="s2">will and we would build in many of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.020" end="01:09:52.120" style="s2">clever networks smart tools so that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.660" end="01:09:53.770" style="s2">all have a better experience and because</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.120" end="01:09:55.390" style="s2">the company is paid by the monthly</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.770" end="01:09:57.460" style="s2">subscription it actually has the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.390" end="01:09:59.680" style="s2">incentive to keep you off the system as</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.460" end="01:10:02.380" style="s2">much as possible so long as you got the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.680" end="01:10:06.040" style="s2">maximum amount of value isn&#39;t that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.380" end="01:10:08.020" style="s2">correct incentive well I think again the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.040" end="01:10:09.880" style="s2">in terms of leverage of software we</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.020" end="01:10:11.410" style="s2">think now very much on the internet one</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.880" end="01:10:13.060" style="s2">of the legacy sort of things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.410" end="01:10:15.070" style="s2">heritage from the success of the frozen</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.060" end="01:10:16.420" style="s2">accident of the internet is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.070" end="01:10:18.730" style="s2">thinking that these must intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.420" end="01:10:20.740" style="s2">the client-server and they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.730" end="01:10:23.560" style="s2">be we can create very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.740" end="01:10:25.750" style="s2">peer-to-peer communication networks now</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.560" end="01:10:27.910" style="s2">we still need some level of transport</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.750" end="01:10:29.710" style="s2">levels decentralisation for each</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.910" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">optimize for low latency and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.710" end="01:10:32.860" style="s2">resilience and things like that but at</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:34.750" style="s2">the end of the day people are talking to</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.860" end="01:10:36.520" style="s2">each other people don&#39;t have to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.750" end="01:10:38.980" style="s2">a server and so a lot of the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.520" end="01:10:41.530" style="s2">behind the decentralized web are really</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.980" end="01:10:44.140" style="s2">around creating these tools that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.530" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t impose a client-server model</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.140" end="01:10:47.050" style="s2">and the reason that&#39;s so important is</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:49.620" style="s2">because the instant you have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.050" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">client-server software architecture</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.620" end="01:10:52.690" style="s2">obviously as the app maker or the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:56.380" style="s2">developer you&#39;re gonna run the server</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.690" end="01:10:58.660" style="s2">for everyone and now as you scale you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.380" end="01:11:00.850" style="s2">naturally carry this drag with you right</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.660" end="01:11:03.250" style="s2">every every user you get is another</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.850" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">liability and you&#39;ve got to keep a</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.250" end="01:11:06.160" style="s2">session alive you gotta back up their</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:07.510" style="s2">data you got to delete if they ask you</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.160" end="01:11:10.450" style="s2">to if you&#39;re complying with gdpr</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.510" end="01:11:11.909" style="s2">all those nonsense so the pernicious</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.450" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">thing about client-server are</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.909" end="01:11:18.179" style="s2">is that they force successful businesses</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:20.100" style="s2">in that environment must have scaling</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.179" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">problems they must need to then monetize</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.100" end="01:11:26.130" style="s2">every users use because they&#39;re taxed by</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.000" end="01:11:29.130" style="s2">bandwidth costs so then you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.130" end="01:11:30.810" style="s2">at putting either monthly charge in or</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.130" end="01:11:32.580" style="s2">selling ads or something like that but</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.810" end="01:11:34.469" style="s2">what if you actually just create a</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.580" end="01:11:36.330" style="s2">system that didn&#39;t do it that way what</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.469" end="01:11:37.949" style="s2">if you create a system that just had</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.330" end="01:11:38.909" style="s2">users have their own data if they wanted</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.949" end="01:11:41.280" style="s2">backup their data somewhere else they</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.909" end="01:11:42.360" style="s2">can and to share they share their data</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.280" end="01:11:44.280" style="s2">at one time with someone else the data</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.360" end="01:11:46.739" style="s2">moves over there and and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.280" end="01:11:48.239" style="s2">that&#39;s a very natural system no server</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.739" end="01:11:49.620" style="s2">needs to be up I don&#39;t need to if I need</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.239" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">if I&#39;m sitting next to you at dinner</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.620" end="01:11:52.500" style="s2">I&#39;ll share a picture with you doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">have to round-trip to Cupertino or</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.500" end="01:11:57.449" style="s2">Mountain View you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:59.639" style="s2">model dramatically increases the amount</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.449" end="01:12:02.010" style="s2">of bandwidth available it dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.639" end="01:12:04.679" style="s2">decreases the the cost to build new</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.010" end="01:12:07.520" style="s2">innovative types of software and so I</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.679" end="01:12:09.960" style="s2">think that is why I&#39;m so gung-ho on</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.520" end="01:12:12.560" style="s2">pursuing the decentralized web</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.960" end="01:12:14.850" style="s2">technologies as the next generation of</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.639" end="01:12:20.760" style="s2">decentralized Facebook it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:22.920" style="s2">creating better better Wikipedia&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:12:22.920" end="01:12:27.929" style="s2">notebooks it&#39;s better everything when we</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.020" end="01:12:30.179" style="s2">don&#39;t force decentralized surveillance</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.929" end="01:12:31.530" style="s2">we&#39;re ad-supported kinds of companies</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.179" end="01:12:33.690" style="s2">and i don&#39;t believe because these</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.530" end="01:12:35.480" style="s2">companies are now hugely public worth</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.690" end="01:12:37.920" style="s2">fifty hundreds of billions of dollars</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.239" end="01:12:49.469" style="s2">a basically deeply pessimistic outlook</p>

<p begin="01:12:58.199" end="01:13:02.239" style="s2">but I want to make a little sidebar here</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.820" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">maybe it is feasible to have</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:09.870" style="s2">these days and when did the numbers and</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.870" end="01:13:12.840" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s revenue per month per user is</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.870" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">a dollar ninety-nine and built into that</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.840" end="01:13:16.120" style="s2">dollar ninety nine is a bunch of profit</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:19.390" style="s2">they have a very high</p>

<p begin="01:13:21.640" end="01:13:26.740" style="s2">operate probably as a profitable</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.710" end="01:13:55.090" style="s2">think it&#39;s something like 15 to 25</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.230" end="01:13:57.130" style="s2">dollars per quarter so it&#39;s much more</p>

<p begin="01:13:59.170" end="01:14:03.910" style="s2">on average keep in mind Facebook is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.630" end="01:14:06.820" style="s2">targeted advertising platform so the</p>

<p begin="01:14:26.470" end="01:14:30.700" style="s2">just they had a big old campaign of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.570" end="01:14:32.380" style="s2">Facebook just a charges and I was like</p>

<p begin="01:14:33.700" end="01:14:37.600" style="s2">dynamic and second of all because you</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.640" end="01:14:50.110" style="s2">tied to that then is their market cap at</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.100" end="01:14:52.300" style="s2">the end of the day they are one of a</p>

<p begin="01:15:17.410" end="01:15:20.260" style="s2">Libre stuff is because they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.970" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">pivot to see if maybe that&#39;s another</p>

<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:25.500" style="s2">the end of the day I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.470" end="01:15:28.650" style="s2">fundamentally philosophically</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.500" end="01:15:30.990" style="s2">inappropriate to be the central entity</p>

<p begin="01:15:36.390" end="01:15:39.660" style="s2">way and I agree with you that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.250" end="01:15:41.850" style="s2">incumbents can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.660" end="01:15:45.240" style="s2">but I would just hold out to you young</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.850" end="01:15:48.270" style="s2">entrepreneur wannabes that maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.240" end="01:15:50.490" style="s2">time is right because if you can get $2</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.270" end="01:15:53.970" style="s2">a month from people and you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.490" end="01:15:56.040" style="s2">if they&#39;re poor or rich right then you</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.970" end="01:15:57.960" style="s2">can support a service that has the level</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.040" end="01:16:00.390" style="s2">of complexity of Facebook at least its</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.960" end="01:16:01.560" style="s2">scale where the scale transform is I</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.390" end="01:16:03.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know but I bet it&#39;s a shitload</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.560" end="01:16:05.070" style="s2">lower than it used to be now that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.570" end="01:16:06.900" style="s2">can actually build your back-end on</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.070" end="01:16:08.670" style="s2">cloud services and don&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.900" end="01:16:11.820" style="s2">high fixed costs or running your own</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.670" end="01:16:13.880" style="s2">data center it might just work so the</p>

<p begin="01:16:13.880" end="01:16:18.480" style="s2">might bring them down particularly</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.860" end="01:16:20.910" style="s2">because it would preferentially I would</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.480" end="01:16:22.590" style="s2">posit strip away their most valuable</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.910" end="01:16:24.180" style="s2">customers you know it&#39;s the people that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.590" end="01:16:25.680" style="s2">are willing to pay two dollars or five</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.180" end="01:16:28.110" style="s2">dollars a month that as you point out</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.680" end="01:16:30.690" style="s2">might be worth $50 a month and as those</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.110" end="01:16:33.960" style="s2">people migrate to the cheap paid</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.690" end="01:16:36.480" style="s2">platform that has a pro consumer rather</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.960" end="01:16:38.730" style="s2">than an exploitive business model that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.480" end="01:16:40.410" style="s2">could be very destabilizing just the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.730" end="01:16:42.300" style="s2">thought for you young entrepreneurs out</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.410" end="01:16:44.040" style="s2">there go get them well it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.300" end="01:16:45.780" style="s2">other thing to keep in mind is there is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.040" end="01:16:46.440" style="s2">a hysteresis to this or a past</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.780" end="01:16:48.120" style="s2">dependence</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.440" end="01:16:49.590" style="s2">it took Facebook a lot of effort to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.120" end="01:16:51.480" style="s2">everyone onto Facebook now that</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.590" end="01:16:53.070" style="s2">everyone&#39;s on Facebook you know when the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.480" end="01:16:55.110" style="s2">next platform comes along all it has to</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.070" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">do is hey click here to invite your</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.110" end="01:16:58.800" style="s2">Facebook friends button right or click</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:00.360" style="s2">this you know share this link on</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.800" end="01:17:02.850" style="s2">Facebook to have your friends join you</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.360" end="01:17:04.770" style="s2">on this new network that&#39;s doable like</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.850" end="01:17:06.660" style="s2">that kind of thing is doable and so you</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.770" end="01:17:08.040" style="s2">people can bootstrap the next Network</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.660" end="01:17:09.330" style="s2">off of Facebook the way that Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.040" end="01:17:12.030" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have boots dropped off of</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.330" end="01:17:14.250" style="s2">MySpace or you know like classmates.com</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.030" end="01:17:15.510" style="s2">god forbid so so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.250" end="01:17:16.680" style="s2">definitely the opportunity there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.510" end="01:17:17.640" style="s2">again I wouldn&#39;t be investing in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.680" end="01:17:20.160" style="s2">space if I didn&#39;t think it was possible</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.640" end="01:17:22.590" style="s2">to change it but it is going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.160" end="01:17:25.290" style="s2">process let&#39;s move on to the next item</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.590" end="01:17:27.180" style="s2">and that is as you hinted at you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.290" end="01:17:29.310" style="s2">a significant player in thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.180" end="01:17:30.750" style="s2">an alternative distributed network</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.310" end="01:17:32.220" style="s2">architecture and now you and I have</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.750" end="01:17:35.430" style="s2">talked about some really radical stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.220" end="01:17:38.469" style="s2">ideas of yours so go riff on the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.430" end="01:17:39.639" style="s2">a distributed internet a distributed web</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.469" end="01:17:42.760" style="s2">all the cool things that could be done</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.639" end="01:17:44.619" style="s2">on it okay so the basic idea actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.760" end="01:17:46.150" style="s2">came to me not because I&#39;m a you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.619" end="01:17:47.559" style="s2">crypto anarchist from the 90s or</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.150" end="01:17:49.449" style="s2">anything but actually was a few years</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.559" end="01:17:52.179" style="s2">ago that I had this realization that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.449" end="01:17:53.979" style="s2">almost all of the data that I get in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.179" end="01:17:56.139" style="s2">space of a year that I download read</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.979" end="01:17:58.630" style="s2">consume whatever all the content that I</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.139" end="01:18:00.489" style="s2">get could fit on a flash ship the size</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.630" end="01:18:02.320" style="s2">of my pinky nail that pretty much hold</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.489" end="01:18:03.999" style="s2">all you know maybe barring like</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:06.369" style="s2">streaming 4k movies and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.999" end="01:18:08.619" style="s2">but most everything else to news the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.369" end="01:18:10.900" style="s2">fake news everything all of it can fit</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.619" end="01:18:13.630" style="s2">on a physical device the size of my</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.900" end="01:18:15.519" style="s2">pinky nail so I thought about wow now</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.630" end="01:18:16.780" style="s2">that&#39;s of course getting it all once</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.519" end="01:18:19.659" style="s2">it&#39;s different than you know getting it</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.780" end="01:18:21.610" style="s2">on demand but still you know it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.659" end="01:18:23.229" style="s2">got me thinking about you know we put a</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.610" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">lot of infrastructure in place to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.229" end="01:18:28.269" style="s2">this client-server stuff when really the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:31.090" style="s2">content sharing piece can be done in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.269" end="01:18:32.229" style="s2">way that&#39;s orthogonal to you know lots</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.090" end="01:18:33.789" style="s2">of these other things I sort of went</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.229" end="01:18:35.380" style="s2">down this rat hole of like looking at</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.789" end="01:18:37.210" style="s2">things like IP FS looking all this other</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.380" end="01:18:39.880" style="s2">stuff and I emerged out the other end</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.210" end="01:18:42.610" style="s2">realizing that there&#39;s a few pieces that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.880" end="01:18:44.650" style="s2">we need to actually create we create a</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.610" end="01:18:47.650" style="s2">radically different kind of approach</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.650" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">which is basically to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.650" end="01:18:53.409" style="s2">client-server approach of HTTP is busted</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:55.920" style="s2">it inherits all of the the problems of</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.409" end="01:18:58.360" style="s2">tcp/ip primarily IP itself and</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.920" end="01:19:01.239" style="s2">client-server architecture fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.360" end="01:19:02.679" style="s2">creates a asymmetry the user does not</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.239" end="01:19:05.050" style="s2">have control and access over their own</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.679" end="01:19:06.519" style="s2">data so then I also realized that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.050" end="01:19:07.900" style="s2">lack of an identity system on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.519" end="01:19:09.699" style="s2">Internet has been a problem since day</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.900" end="01:19:12.909" style="s2">one right since we started getting in</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.699" end="01:19:14.769" style="s2">spam problems and so we use email we use</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.909" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">phone numbers which all these are</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.769" end="01:19:18.099" style="s2">identities that we rent from various</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:21.400" style="s2">centralized services very few people can</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.099" end="01:19:22.929" style="s2">run their own email server anymore so it</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.400" end="01:19:24.190" style="s2">sort of got me thinking I came to this</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.929" end="01:19:26.110" style="s2">realization that we can create a</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.190" end="01:19:28.269" style="s2">radically different architecture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.110" end="01:19:29.800" style="s2">actually very powerful that maintains</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.269" end="01:19:32.199" style="s2">all the modern sort of things that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.800" end="01:19:34.869" style="s2">like to see in our web apps of stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.199" end="01:19:36.909" style="s2">it separates out the interaction of an</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.869" end="01:19:39.280" style="s2">application with the data and then the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.909" end="01:19:40.389" style="s2">transfer of that data to is sharing it</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.280" end="01:19:42.579" style="s2">with other people so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.389" end="01:19:43.780" style="s2">point-to-point system for people to</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.579" end="01:19:46.300" style="s2">share their data with each other</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.780" end="01:19:48.729" style="s2">we then use some modern techniques like</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.300" end="01:19:50.499" style="s2">CR DTS and some other sort of hash</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.729" end="01:19:50.910" style="s2">blockchain myrtle trees sort of based</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.499" end="01:19:53.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.910" end="01:19:55.350" style="s2">we can create decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.400" end="01:19:57.420" style="s2">infrastructure for running apps that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.350" end="01:19:59.010" style="s2">eventually consistent that&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.420" end="01:20:00.390" style="s2">you know imagine if this is maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.010" end="01:20:02.700" style="s2">best way to put it is is imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.390" end="01:20:03.990" style="s2">visiting a website to view you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.700" end="01:20:05.940" style="s2">going to someone else&#39;s server to be a</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.990" end="01:20:07.770" style="s2">webpage instead of what we did is we</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.940" end="01:20:10.380" style="s2">made a two-step so that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.770" end="01:20:11.700" style="s2">Dropbox and I share my Dropbox folder</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.380" end="01:20:14.430" style="s2">with you so they&#39;re synchronized</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.700" end="01:20:15.900" style="s2">whenever we they can be but I then point</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.430" end="01:20:18.150" style="s2">my web browser to just look at my local</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.900" end="01:20:19.560" style="s2">Dropbox if I want to edit a file and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.150" end="01:20:21.180" style="s2">save it saves it to local storage it</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.560" end="01:20:23.160" style="s2">saves in the Dropbox eventually I get</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.180" end="01:20:25.620" style="s2">synchronized to your Dropbox and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.160" end="01:20:27.210" style="s2">you open up and look at it and just by</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.620" end="01:20:29.610" style="s2">separating out that application</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.210" end="01:20:33.240" style="s2">interaction with the state and then the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.610" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">transfer and merge of State down the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.240" end="01:20:38.160" style="s2">road we can create a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:39.900" style="s2">different architecture that then doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.160" end="01:20:42.630" style="s2">put a Google or Facebook in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.900" end="01:20:44.940" style="s2">of things and furthermore if we separate</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.630" end="01:20:47.640" style="s2">transport of data from the application</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.940" end="01:20:49.590" style="s2">communication to data we can create mesh</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.640" end="01:20:50.820" style="s2">networks and local things for instance I</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.590" end="01:20:53.280" style="s2">had this incredibly frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.820" end="01:20:55.590" style="s2">experience when I was on a flight in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.280" end="01:20:58.050" style="s2">international flight with my family and</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.590" end="01:21:00.120" style="s2">I had a video file on my phone that my</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.050" end="01:21:02.220" style="s2">kids wanted to watch I was on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.120" end="01:21:04.580" style="s2">Android device there on an iPad and</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.220" end="01:21:07.350" style="s2">between these two devices I could not</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.580" end="01:21:08.700" style="s2">without you know there&#39;s no Wi-Fi there</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.350" end="01:21:11.790" style="s2">was no internet</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.700" end="01:21:13.710" style="s2">I could not transfer like actually it</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.790" end="01:21:14.700" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a video file it was like 30 Meg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.710" end="01:21:16.350" style="s2">of mp3s</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.700" end="01:21:18.510" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t transfer these songs from</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.350" end="01:21:19.740" style="s2">this one thing to another without being</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.510" end="01:21:22.290" style="s2">connected to some centralized data</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.740" end="01:21:24.630" style="s2">center and that was just absurd but if</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.290" end="01:21:27.330" style="s2">we were to use local mesh based</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.630" end="01:21:30.180" style="s2">technologies my phone and the iPad could</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.330" end="01:21:32.130" style="s2">communicate i gigabit speeds and I could</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.180" end="01:21:33.660" style="s2">just transfer that to the device there</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.130" end="01:21:34.890" style="s2">and they could just play it so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.660" end="01:21:36.630" style="s2">completely different way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.890" end="01:21:38.060" style="s2">about applications about thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.630" end="01:21:40.560" style="s2">the relationships between output</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.060" end="01:21:42.690" style="s2">application authors and the data and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.560" end="01:21:45.180" style="s2">the users and their data and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.690" end="01:21:47.460" style="s2">i support i&#39;ve been funding the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.180" end="01:21:50.280" style="s2">beaker and the dot projects and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.460" end="01:21:52.620" style="s2">alternative way of building a browser</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.280" end="01:21:54.780" style="s2">and application structures and user</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.620" end="01:21:56.190" style="s2">authentication and all these things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.780" end="01:21:57.450" style="s2">an alternative way of building</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.190" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">essentially an internet infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.450" end="01:21:59.989" style="s2">let&#39;s tell the people where they can</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:02.090" style="s2">find out more</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.989" end="01:22:04.580" style="s2">beaker will say the other one was debts</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.090" end="01:22:08.630" style="s2">he asks us the dat project org I believe</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.580" end="01:22:10.070" style="s2">in beaker browser comm that dat dat can</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.630" end="01:22:12.620" style="s2">tell us a little bit about those project</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.070" end="01:22:14.540" style="s2">what do they do well so that is you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.620" end="01:22:17.510" style="s2">think about it as essentially like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.540" end="01:22:20.989" style="s2">peer-to-peer BitTorrent like protocol</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.510" end="01:22:23.570" style="s2">for doing decentralized Dropbox so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.989" end="01:22:25.880" style="s2">a blockchain based system and you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.570" end="01:22:27.860" style="s2">create a data archive of anything on</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.880" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">your drive is basically a shared folder</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.860" end="01:22:32.330" style="s2">that automatically syncs with other</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:34.580" style="s2">people have a copy of your shared folder</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.330" end="01:22:36.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the DAT project so kind of works</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.580" end="01:22:38.300" style="s2">like ipfs but there&#39;s not an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.560" end="01:22:40.010" style="s2">monetize there&#39;s no file coin</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.300" end="01:22:41.719" style="s2">monetization model built onto it and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.010" end="01:22:43.700" style="s2">then the second thing that beaker</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.719" end="01:22:46.040" style="s2">browser it&#39;s a browser from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.700" end="01:22:48.710" style="s2">decentralized web so it looks at your</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.040" end="01:22:49.969" style="s2">local data archive it runs a full I</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.710" end="01:22:52.910" style="s2">means a full flash browser so it can</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.969" end="01:22:54.440" style="s2">speak to HTTP colon slash slash standard</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.910" end="01:22:55.910" style="s2">internet sites you can load up Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.440" end="01:22:58.700" style="s2">you can go to Twitter everything works</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.910" end="01:23:01.550" style="s2">great it&#39;s just a web browser but it can</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.700" end="01:23:05.330" style="s2">also load dat colon slash slash URLs</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.550" end="01:23:08.020" style="s2">which then are you know 32 byte hashes</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.330" end="01:23:11.090" style="s2">or 64 byte hashes that basically go and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.020" end="01:23:14.510" style="s2">create or than they create on your local</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.090" end="01:23:17.000" style="s2">machine a mirror of a particular you</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.510" end="01:23:18.860" style="s2">know shared archive and then it opens it</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.000" end="01:23:20.330" style="s2">up on the local machine and you can make</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.860" end="01:23:22.250" style="s2">your own copy of it you can edit the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.330" end="01:23:24.050" style="s2">code you know to the source code of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.250" end="01:23:25.790" style="s2">application that&#39;s being served up and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.050" end="01:23:27.020" style="s2">they&#39;ve built chat apps on top of this</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.790" end="01:23:29.390" style="s2">they built like a slack like thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.020" end="01:23:31.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve built decentralized Twitter even</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.390" end="01:23:32.600" style="s2">a basic decentralized Facebook like</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.040" end="01:23:35.480" style="s2">thing and the whole idea here is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.600" end="01:23:36.980" style="s2">websites now become central the websites</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.480" end="01:23:39.350" style="s2">again becomes central to the experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.980" end="01:23:41.090" style="s2">the data itself becomes central to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.350" end="01:23:42.650" style="s2">experience and applications just</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.090" end="01:23:43.640" style="s2">lightweight things that sit on top and</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.650" end="01:23:45.770" style="s2">give you different kinds of you eyes</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.640" end="01:23:47.239" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer walled garden</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.770" end="01:23:49.340" style="s2">platforms that you for call your</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.239" end="01:23:51.320" style="s2">activity and data into you your data</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.340" end="01:23:52.610" style="s2">still your data and apps are just</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.320" end="01:23:53.570" style="s2">lightweight things that manipulated to</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.610" end="01:23:55.520" style="s2">show it to you in different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.570" end="01:23:57.010" style="s2">ways it&#39;s a really wonderful system and</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.520" end="01:23:58.750" style="s2">have you have there been</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.010" end="01:24:00.940" style="s2">some winners yet you know again this way</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.750" end="01:24:02.980" style="s2">we know each one of these new platforms</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.940" end="01:24:05.949" style="s2">to take off usually there&#39;s a single</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.980" end="01:24:09.579" style="s2">winner you know the Apple took off with</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.949" end="01:24:13.510" style="s2">busy calc and the IBM PC took off with</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.579" end="01:24:15.610" style="s2">Lotus 1-2-3 the Mac took off with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.510" end="01:24:18.400" style="s2">various graphics tools that were created</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.610" end="01:24:20.590" style="s2">for it sir in your mind a application</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.400" end="01:24:23.230" style="s2">that has done so well on these new</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.590" end="01:24:25.059" style="s2">platforms that it&#39;s compelling no not</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.230" end="01:24:26.829" style="s2">yet it&#39;s still early stages on the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.059" end="01:24:28.510" style="s2">it&#39;s so early days take a look at I</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.829" end="01:24:30.639" style="s2">would encourage other people you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.510" end="01:24:33.280" style="s2">who are thinking about something new I</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.639" end="01:24:36.219" style="s2">mean I remember how exciting it was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.280" end="01:24:38.590" style="s2">web in 1992 I can&#39;t even make myself</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.219" end="01:24:41.110" style="s2">think about the web anymore it&#39;s so old</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.590" end="01:24:42.579" style="s2">and horrifying so it&#39;d be fun to</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.110" end="01:24:44.380" style="s2">actually spend a few cycles looking at</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.579" end="01:24:45.880" style="s2">something entirely fresh I&#39;m sure there</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.380" end="01:24:48.280" style="s2">are a lot of other people out there who</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.880" end="01:24:50.469" style="s2">feel the same way well it is nice to</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.280" end="01:24:52.630" style="s2">have had a privilege and it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.469" end="01:24:55.510" style="s2">privilege to have ringside seats</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.630" end="01:24:58.179" style="s2">watching a generative open collaborative</p>

<p begin="01:25:06.730" end="01:25:10.269" style="s2">something fascinating to watch but you</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.860" end="01:25:13.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s a long conversation to talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.269" end="01:25:14.920" style="s2">about the OS technical debt which of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.210" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">operating systems that led us to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.920" end="01:25:19.179" style="s2">browser winning as essentially the</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.179" end="01:25:22.360" style="s2">this kind of thing happening but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:24.280" style="s2">maybe a different conversation for a</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.360" end="01:25:26.199" style="s2">different time yep I think in fact we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.280" end="01:25:28.750" style="s2">come near to the end of our time do you</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.199" end="01:25:30.010" style="s2">have any final thoughts I just wanna say</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.750" end="01:25:31.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a privilege to have this</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.010" end="01:25:32.949" style="s2">conversation with you and thank you very</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.150" end="01:25:35.349" style="s2">much for having me on the show and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.949" end="01:25:39.099" style="s2">say I had high high expectations you</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.349" end="01:25:42.040" style="s2">exceeded them this has been an amazingly</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.099" end="01:25:44.020" style="s2">broad and deep conversation which is the</p>
