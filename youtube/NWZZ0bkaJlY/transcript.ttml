<p begin="00:20:02.930" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">last-minute questions here&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.430" end="00:20:18.560" style="s2">if you lose the flow should you just go</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:22.340" style="s2">through these points again you&#39;ll tend</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.560" end="00:20:24.560" style="s2">to lose the flow in general because</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.340" end="00:20:27.220" style="s2">you&#39;re beginning to learn I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.560" end="00:20:30.800" style="s2">recommend just doing a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.220" end="00:20:33.740" style="s2">reconnecting with the Dante abdomen area</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.800" end="00:20:36.170" style="s2">the heart the shoulders the body just</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.740" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">try and get that reengaged of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.170" end="00:20:44.930" style="s2">thing but get back to the breath sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">as quickly as as you can what do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.930" end="00:20:50.360" style="s2">think about using audio aids this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:51.860" style="s2">from Marc in meditation I use this all</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.360" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">the time myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.860" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">the difficulty with audio aids it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:20:58.340" style="s2">called encoding specificity this is from</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:01.550" style="s2">cognitive science your brain is always</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.340" end="00:21:04.460" style="s2">storing the context in addition to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.550" end="00:21:05.690" style="s2">information it&#39;s storing and you can use</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.460" end="00:21:09.260" style="s2">this to your advantage if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.690" end="00:21:10.580" style="s2">remember something for an exam you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.260" end="00:21:11.900" style="s2">our tests play some music while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.580" end="00:21:14.390" style="s2">studying that material then imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.900" end="00:21:15.680" style="s2">music when you are studying it but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.390" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">reverse is also the case that also</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.680" end="00:21:21.560" style="s2">limits you so what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:23.510" style="s2">with audio aids especially things like</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.560" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">music is your brain is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.510" end="00:21:27.830" style="s2">encoding specificity and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">always be looking for that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:32.030" style="s2">trying to get into the mindfulness State</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">which means when you are places where</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.030" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">those aids in meditation or more much</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.810" style="s2">more importantly when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:42.390" style="s2">bring mindfulness into your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.810" end="00:21:43.830" style="s2">life you won&#39;t have those aids available</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.390" end="00:21:45.870" style="s2">and you&#39;ll your brain will find it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.830" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">difficult to transition into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.870" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">mindfulness you need so I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:52.440" style="s2">recommend as soon as you can gradually</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:55.140" style="s2">because you probably have built up a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.440" end="00:22:00.390" style="s2">habit weaning yourself off of any of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.140" end="00:22:02.760" style="s2">those kinds of auditory aids the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.390" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">one is from Andre Ferrer in the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.760" end="00:22:06.390" style="s2">video you said about getting to feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:09.150" style="s2">your pulse in the thumb how do I do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.390" end="00:22:11.250" style="s2">without pinching it too hard yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.150" end="00:22:12.840" style="s2">have to sort of move it around and play</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.250" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:19.080" style="s2">it takes quite a bit of practice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">sensitivity to get it so you try it I</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.710" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">leave it off go back to the centering</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.660" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">and rooting and then gradually work your</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:37.650" style="s2">way back in to the practice if I start</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:40.770" style="s2">to slow to this because I have not</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.650" end="00:24:42.210" style="s2">rooted properly it can be this is from</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.880" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">begin with you doing this so you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.890" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">tell you&#39;re falling asleep if it feels</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:56.130" style="s2">like sort of your mind is the scope of</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.049" end="00:25:02.010" style="s2">comfortable and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a sign</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.450" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">that what you need to do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.010" end="00:25:07.770" style="s2">more flow make sure your baby breathing</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.870" end="00:25:12.990" style="s2">many of you consider taking up I</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.340" end="00:25:14.429" style="s2">recommended this yesterday I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.990" end="00:25:17.250" style="s2">mindfulness practice like pi Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.429" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">or yoga because right before you sit</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.250" end="00:25:21.720" style="s2">because that will help actually energize</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:24.630" style="s2">you while getting you properly routed</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.720" end="00:25:26.010" style="s2">and flowing so that you will not tend to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.630" end="00:25:30.840" style="s2">slouch or fall asleep when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.010" end="00:25:32.730" style="s2">sitting and again when I&#39;m centered and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.840" end="00:25:34.110" style="s2">rooted all I feel and I focus on my</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.730" end="00:25:35.940" style="s2">breathing I feel like losing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.110" end="00:25:37.500" style="s2">consciousness like following to sleep my</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.940" end="00:25:40.350" style="s2">head is not tilted forward anything is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.500" end="00:25:41.820" style="s2">this is this normal it can be because</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.350" end="00:25:43.590" style="s2">what&#39;s typically happening as I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.820" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">mentioned your brain is getting very</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.590" end="00:25:48.809" style="s2">powerful signals that your to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:51.299" style="s2">interception awareness and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.809" end="00:25:54.419" style="s2">relaxing and it can miss read those</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.299" end="00:25:57.150" style="s2">single those signals as falling asleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.419" end="00:25:58.710" style="s2">so just reengage maybe even your breath</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.150" end="00:26:00.510" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.710" end="00:26:04.500" style="s2">you know we engage flow a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.510" end="00:26:09.540" style="s2">more but also like I said you may want</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.500" end="00:26:12.330" style="s2">to take some kind of moving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.540" end="00:26:14.490" style="s2">practice that you can engage just before</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.330" end="00:26:17.910" style="s2">you sit because that will help energize</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.490" end="00:26:19.410" style="s2">you in the appropriate manner</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.910" end="00:26:21.510" style="s2">this is Alexei how long do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.410" end="00:26:22.980" style="s2">personally do rooting for I do not quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.510" end="00:26:24.990" style="s2">understand it and doing it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.980" end="00:26:26.790" style="s2">takes me further for my state so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.990" end="00:26:28.740" style="s2">if I don&#39;t do it or do it briefly my</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.790" end="00:26:30.840" style="s2">practice is better you may be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.740" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">it briefly I don&#39;t know you individually</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.840" end="00:26:35.160" style="s2">this is one of the difficulties with the</p>
