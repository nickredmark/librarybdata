<p begin="00:00:07.029" end="00:00:10.700" style="s2">Averell until i recently brought out a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.900" end="00:00:12.620" style="s2">few films about david icke and london</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.700" end="00:00:15.170" style="s2">real and there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.620" end="00:00:18.730" style="s2">topics that they raise censorship free</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.170" end="00:00:21.590" style="s2">speech the growth in conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.730" end="00:00:23.660" style="s2">the recent planned emic film blew up a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.590" end="00:00:26.060" style="s2">few days ago and that&#39;s even even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.660" end="00:00:27.680" style="s2">than the david icke interview so I felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.060" end="00:00:29.899" style="s2">kind of overwhelmed with all of those</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.680" end="00:00:31.399" style="s2">different threads to follow I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.899" end="00:00:34.519" style="s2">the best thing to do would be to talk it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.399" end="00:00:36.730" style="s2">through with my friend Peter Limburg who</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.519" end="00:00:40.070" style="s2">he&#39;s done a lot on this topic with his</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.730" end="00:00:42.589" style="s2">intellectual Explorers podcast and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.070" end="00:00:45.379" style="s2">recently we put out the film culture war</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.589" end="00:00:46.929" style="s2">2.0 with him on rebel wisdom so we look</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:49.579" style="s2">at all of these different topics and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.929" end="00:00:53.030" style="s2">especially kind of try and dig into what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.579" end="00:00:55.399" style="s2">is good journalism good sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.030" end="00:00:57.890" style="s2">in this environment this kind of liminal</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.399" end="00:01:01.190" style="s2">space that we&#39;re all in which peter has</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.890" end="00:01:02.989" style="s2">called the liminal war just just for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.190" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">topology of the conversation what what</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.989" end="00:01:12.020" style="s2">are your what are your thoughts I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:14.420" style="s2">my first question would be what are you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.020" end="00:01:17.719" style="s2">hoping to get from a conversation like</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.420" end="00:01:21.229" style="s2">this yeah I put out those three films</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.719" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">last week and there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.229" end="00:01:25.909" style="s2">angles to them there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:28.430" style="s2">kind of questions about sense-making in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.909" end="00:01:30.500" style="s2">the liminal space that we&#39;re in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.430" end="00:01:31.869" style="s2">the massive topic of conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:36.170" style="s2">that is kind of exploding right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.869" end="00:01:37.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this sense of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.170" end="00:01:41.229" style="s2">reaction of like the big tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.700" end="00:01:43.909" style="s2">there&#39;s the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.229" end="00:01:45.049" style="s2">conspiracy and sense making and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.909" end="00:01:46.729" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve been talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.049" end="00:01:51.140" style="s2">the channel for a very long time like</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.729" end="00:01:53.270" style="s2">how we use discernment in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.140" end="00:01:56.119" style="s2">digitalized age to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.270" end="00:01:59.539" style="s2">rather than relying on truth and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.119" end="00:02:02.210" style="s2">sort of the broadcast mainstream blue</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.539" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">church apparatus to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.210" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">and all of these different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:07.130" style="s2">making sense kind of in cut in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:09.320" style="s2">competition and clashing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.130" end="00:02:10.730" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know what the answers are I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.320" end="00:02:12.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the solution is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.730" end="00:02:15.140" style="s2">think anyone knows what the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.320" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">finding truth in the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.140" end="00:02:20.040" style="s2">decentralized environment is I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">about this kind of interregnum period</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:26.060" style="s2">where we&#39;ve lost the sense making blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:28.820" style="s2">church apparatus and we were basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.060" end="00:02:31.400" style="s2">whether we realized it or not we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.820" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">offloading a lot of our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">capacity to that structure so blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:39.380" style="s2">church being the establishment that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">constructed after 1945 that includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.380" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">hierarchical Authority it&#39;s a generally</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">broadcast model it obviously includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">all of the the main media organizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">and now we&#39;re having to reboot from from</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">scratch but we&#39;re doing it in a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">kind of haphazard way and and really</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.110" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">like rebel wisdom has been about at</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">least from the the middle of last year</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">rather than the content itself it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:10.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the process that we come to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">making sense of the world and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.440" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">improve that how can we improve our</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">discernment how can we how can we catch</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">ourselves lot locking into like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:23.640" style="s2">certainty and certain explanations how</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:25.830" style="s2">can we rest in uncertainty and weigh</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.640" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">things up and this area of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.830" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">theory more than any other seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:34.019" style="s2">that quality of like this is the truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:37.769" style="s2">and then and then a real attachment in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.019" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">sort of pseudo religious way and I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.769" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">feel it really difficult to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:44.190" style="s2">it because there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">things like the word conspiracy is such</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">an overloaded term there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:53.130" style="s2">alternative narratives of which some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">them have more truth than others and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.130" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">it&#39;s used as a way of kind of dismissing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">anything that it sort of deviates from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">mainstream narrative but then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:04.470" style="s2">another factor in there as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2">where I feel like there&#39;s a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.470" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">difference between alternative</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">narratives of things that have happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:14.930" style="s2">like the Kennedy assassination but</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:18.979" style="s2">particular events and then this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.930" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">all-consuming explanation for everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.979" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">which a friend of mine was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">recently and he said and I it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:28.740" style="s2">a qualitative difference to me like</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:30.539" style="s2">those two things and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.740" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">can slip into the other very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.539" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">very easily but why I wanted to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:37.349" style="s2">into this conversation with you is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.430" end="00:04:39.330" style="s2">I know you you&#39;ve run the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.349" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">Explorers Club you&#39;ve dealt with these</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.330" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">topics a lot you&#39;ve probably gone more</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">deeply into it than I have and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">sense that the right way to proceed is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:55.319" style="s2">in this inquiry rather than a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:57.539" style="s2">this is what I think modality one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.319" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">criticisms of the piece that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.539" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">was was right the Brian Rose piece was</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:06.389" style="s2">look fuller is just trying to set</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">himself up as the as the judge and jury</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.389" end="00:05:11.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">obviously not a that&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:15.240" style="s2">like even though even when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:17.699" style="s2">that kind of talking to camera it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.240" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">a definitive statement but there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.699" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">something about the nature of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">of YouTube the nature of of broadcast at</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:28.380" style="s2">feels like it feels like a definitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.940" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">statement and as soon as you make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.380" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">definitive statement you open yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">up to be criticized and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:37.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the process and that&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:40.440" style="s2">of coming to truth but it also feels off</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.020" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">in some way I think we have to find a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.440" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">new way of of sense-making in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:49.530" style="s2">particularly in this liminal space what</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:53.880" style="s2">we need is some kind of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.530" end="00:05:56.280" style="s2">rules of engagement or some kind of some</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.880" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">kind of I don&#39;t know decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.280" end="00:06:03.659" style="s2">method of like I don&#39;t know maybe like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">yeah like a code of conduct or like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.659" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">set of principles or something that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:11.789" style="s2">more people can sign up to if I have any</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">any any sort any kind of certainty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.789" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">that certainty is wrong like anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">has any kind of certainty about what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:23.550" style="s2">going on right now and who&#39;s behind it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.240" end="00:06:26.599" style="s2">and what&#39;s really like that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.550" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">an all encompassing explanation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.599" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">immediately suspicious of because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:33.509" style="s2">just get into this let how do they know</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">that if you actually listen carefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.509" end="00:06:36.810" style="s2">and with discernment when lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:39.389" style="s2">are speaking and lots of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.810" end="00:06:40.949" style="s2">getting massively kind of up regulated</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.389" end="00:06:42.540" style="s2">right now and you listen with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.949" end="00:06:44.640" style="s2">discernment you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.540" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">how do they know that okay they may have</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:49.320" style="s2">expertise in this particular area but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:51.540" style="s2">they&#39;re asserting things about Bill</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.320" end="00:06:53.700" style="s2">Gates Falchi like these vast</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.540" end="00:06:56.100" style="s2">conspiracies it&#39;s like they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:06:59.160" style="s2">they have no greater insight into that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.100" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">than anyone else so that was delicious</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.160" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">everything you said there&#39;s like so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.030" style="s2">threads that are coming to mind right</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:10.440" style="s2">now that we can go down I first wanted</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:12.900" style="s2">to say two things that came to mind when</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.440" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">I watched your latest three videos or</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.900" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">rebel wisdoms latest your videos is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.300" style="s2">one that when you&#39;re talking to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:19.560" style="s2">camera that one were you&#39;re talking the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.300" end="00:07:22.320" style="s2">cameras like the first one you did that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.560" end="00:07:23.880" style="s2">I got fired up saying that I got there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.320" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">like I got through most like kink my</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:26.130" style="s2">body that&#39;s when I reached out to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:27.600" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been like away from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.130" end="00:07:29.940" style="s2">rebel ISM family for like the last two</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.600" end="00:07:31.650" style="s2">months cuz of my own project but I got</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.940" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">inspired to get plugged back in after</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.650" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">seeing that and then that&#39;s why when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:37.100" style="s2">reach out to you yesterday that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.910" style="s2">we&#39;re here we just want a you see like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.100" end="00:07:40.440" style="s2">said let&#39;s do this as had this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.910" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s one thing I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.440" end="00:07:44.340" style="s2">wanted to mention the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">wanted to mention was that how I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.340" end="00:07:49.950" style="s2">appreciated your approach because it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.430" end="00:07:51.660" style="s2">like hyper nuanced and there&#39;s no easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.950" end="00:07:53.400" style="s2">answer that you presented like you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.660" end="00:07:56.460" style="s2">the big tech companies like Brian Brian</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.400" end="00:07:57.930" style="s2">rose and like the tension that you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.460" end="00:08:01.110" style="s2">because you like him on one extent but</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.930" end="00:08:03.240" style="s2">then you see his personal faults and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.110" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">actually felt your tension there</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.240" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">I felt the nuance when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:10.200" style="s2">about it and it felt authentic to me so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">I just wanted to appreciate that and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.200" end="00:08:16.950" style="s2">think we need more of that so that being</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:22.350" style="s2">said I have I have a desire to like kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.950" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">of just go down the the confusion your</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.350" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">confusion the unknowingness there just</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:29.490" style="s2">get the color and taste of it but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">that a more prudent question is why</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.490" end="00:08:33.570" style="s2">like let&#39;s maybe go down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.020" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">more though why the conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.570" end="00:08:39.540" style="s2">stuff captured your attention initially</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2">and you already touched on it but as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.540" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of battlefronts in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">the culture war what I&#39;m kind of dubbing</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">the little war now and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.770" style="s2">there about like the potency of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">certainty that the conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.770" end="00:08:54.330" style="s2">narrative has so maybe you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.770" end="00:08:55.870" style="s2">speak a little bit more on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.330" end="00:09:01.150" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.870" end="00:09:03.910" style="s2">the simple answer is that they are like</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.150" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">I&#39;m a journalist and they are as far as</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.910" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">I can tell the most newsworthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:10.540" style="s2">phenomenon right now like if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.810" style="s2">know anything about the way we make</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.540" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">sense of the world you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.810" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">especially right now where we have an</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:20.650" style="s2">almost infinite amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:23.980" style="s2">you can kind of make note pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.650" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">any narrative that you want and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.980" end="00:09:27.220" style="s2">follow these rabbit holes down and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:30.730" style="s2">kind of either persuade it by something</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.220" end="00:09:32.650" style="s2">or not persuaded by something so just as</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.730" end="00:09:35.470" style="s2">a phenomenon it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.650" end="00:09:37.570" style="s2">extraordinary and then it also plays</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.470" end="00:09:40.900" style="s2">into all of these wider topics of how we</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.570" end="00:09:42.279" style="s2">make sense of the world at all why we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.900" end="00:09:44.200" style="s2">think something is true rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.279" end="00:09:47.500" style="s2">something else being true</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:52.170" style="s2">the psychological basis for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.500" end="00:09:54.850" style="s2">this stuff and then why I feel it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.170" end="00:09:56.680" style="s2">difficult to talk about is one that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.850" end="00:09:59.260" style="s2">there&#39;s so much charge around it like</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.680" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">people are really charged up about these</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.260" end="00:10:04.600" style="s2">topics and there&#39;s a kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:07.000" style="s2">dimension to them like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.600" end="00:10:08.920" style="s2">religious dimension to it on some level</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.000" end="00:10:10.120" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t to say again that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.920" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">to make any judgment about the truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.120" end="00:10:15.940" style="s2">claims and so you you get so my</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:19.000" style="s2">uncertainty is tied to this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.940" end="00:10:22.120" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to talk about with</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.000" end="00:10:24.839" style="s2">nuance because if you if you can fall on</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.120" end="00:10:27.070" style="s2">one side of sounding like you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.839" end="00:10:28.420" style="s2">you just need to sort of trust the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.070" end="00:10:30.310" style="s2">mainstream narratives and any</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.420" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">alternative explanations are bullshit or</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.310" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">on the other side of giving too much</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:39.490" style="s2">credence to stuff that is kind of has</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">seems to have very little basis in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.490" end="00:10:46.060" style="s2">reality so you&#39;ve got that kind of knife</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">edge thing so I think that the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.060" end="00:10:51.580" style="s2">place to sort of the right place to hold</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:54.040" style="s2">is like how are we making sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.580" end="00:10:57.209" style="s2">what is our how is a discernment being</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.040" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">challenged where are we collapsing into</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.209" end="00:11:01.750" style="s2">certainty and fixed narratives rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">than holding a balance of probabilities</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.750" end="00:11:06.520" style="s2">a lot of things that sort of frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:09.250" style="s2">themselves as searching for truth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.520" end="00:11:11.080" style="s2">I&#39;d say like the planned emic film</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.250" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">is the most obvious example of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.080" end="00:11:17.140" style="s2">recently is sort of framed as revealing</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:20.380" style="s2">the truth is also like highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.140" end="00:11:24.190" style="s2">manipulative highly partial highly is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.380" end="00:11:25.870" style="s2">this weird sort of dynamic of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.190" end="00:11:28.960" style="s2">going to help you find the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.870" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">it&#39;s our truth it&#39;s this truth like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.960" end="00:11:36.130" style="s2">that feels like a very complex thing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">to unpack like it doesn&#39;t feel the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.130" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">thing on all sides feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:43.660" style="s2">taking people&#39;s agency and people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.630" end="00:11:46.870" style="s2">discernment away because it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.660" end="00:11:50.460" style="s2">part of the as we&#39;ve talked about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.870" end="00:11:54.430" style="s2">on the channel this sort of sense of</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:09.430" style="s2">especially in the field of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.540" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing is like the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.430" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">sticky the most powerful mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.220" end="00:12:22.300" style="s2">artifacts being accelerated increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.190" end="00:12:25.900" style="s2">fast it feels like the pandemic is a is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.300" end="00:12:29.770" style="s2">a catalyst for all of the worst things</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.900" end="00:12:32.350" style="s2">about the game a society weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.770" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">attention selecting for the most</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.070" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">discernment is really under threat while</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.960" end="00:12:52.330" style="s2">at the same time you&#39;ve got this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.790" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">mainstream perspective which actually to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.330" end="00:12:55.330" style="s2">me doesn&#39;t really feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.620" end="00:12:57.010" style="s2">mainstream anymore it feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.330" end="00:12:59.890" style="s2">just one thing among many and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.010" end="00:13:03.310" style="s2">mainstream perspective is being</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.890" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">challenged hugely because lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.310" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">that from the beginning of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:08.680" style="s2">have been sort of like well that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:10.510" style="s2">a conspiracy theory the idea it could</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.680" end="00:13:13.750" style="s2">have come from a lab is a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.510" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">theory right now there&#39;s really for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.750" end="00:13:19.390" style="s2">quite compelling circumstantial evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:21.490" style="s2">at least that it did like it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.390" end="00:13:23.230" style="s2">at least as probable that it came from a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.490" end="00:13:25.030" style="s2">lab as it came from a wild</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.230" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">origin and that&#39;s what that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.030" end="00:13:29.800" style="s2">example but you&#39;ve got this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:31.210" style="s2">sense of the mainstream like that when</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.210" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">like a conspiracy theory right now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">it&#39;s true the mainstream does feel a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:38.260" style="s2">like it comes like if you&#39;re just accept</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:39.880" style="s2">like the blue church is really buckling</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.260" end="00:13:44.380" style="s2">under the strain of novelty and under</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.880" end="00:13:47.770" style="s2">the strain of the this sort of sense</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:56.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like all it&#39;s a it&#39;s a incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.050" end="00:14:00.130" style="s2">difficult to hold picture and I think as</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.530" end="00:14:03.730" style="s2">I kind of tried to unpack in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.130" end="00:14:06.460" style="s2">first film I think our way as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.730" end="00:14:07.690" style="s2">certainties of making sense just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.460" end="00:14:10.060" style="s2">up to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.690" end="00:14:13.410" style="s2">free speech absolutism in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.060" end="00:14:15.940" style="s2">where attention is finite and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:18.070" style="s2">distraction is infinite while the</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.770" end="00:14:27.850" style="s2">while also the necessity of challenging</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.450" end="00:14:29.500" style="s2">some of those narratives as well is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">important and then you&#39;ve got this kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.500" end="00:14:35.380" style="s2">of simplistic collapse of for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2">YouTube saying we will only accept stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.380" end="00:14:39.190" style="s2">now that goes along with the w-h-o</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">guidelines and it&#39;s like have you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.190" end="00:14:43.090" style="s2">you not seem like what the w-h-o has</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:45.100" style="s2">been doing like how in hop to China</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.090" end="00:14:47.710" style="s2">they&#39;ve been saying that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.100" end="00:14:50.200" style="s2">wear masks I mean the whu-oh is has said</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.710" end="00:14:52.810" style="s2">some pretty crazy things yeah when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.200" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">were talking the the word dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.810" end="00:14:56.650" style="s2">comes to mind and actually like kaffir</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">kind of just went through my body a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.650" end="00:14:59.320" style="s2">little bit talking about this knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">that this potentially could be broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.320" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">and the rebel wasn&#39;t channel it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.650" style="s2">oh how&#39;s this gonna be interpreted and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">like that kind of distinction where</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.650" end="00:15:10.510" style="s2">there&#39;s like you know the conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:12.460" style="s2">aspects of the blue church and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.510" end="00:15:13.960" style="s2">whole kind of kind of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.460" end="00:15:14.590" style="s2">narrative q and on all the stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.960" end="00:15:19.530" style="s2">coming online</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.590" end="00:15:22.960" style="s2">and how do you talk with nuance there</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.530" end="00:15:25.420" style="s2">without pissing either of them off like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.960" end="00:15:27.580" style="s2">for me with the the stuff I used to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.420" end="00:15:29.260" style="s2">with the culture war analysis it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:31.060" style="s2">I really like to take the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.260" end="00:15:32.830" style="s2">charity writing where I passed that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.060" end="00:15:36.610" style="s2">ideological Turing test in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.830" end="00:15:38.649" style="s2">where I can map out a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.610" end="00:15:40.390" style="s2">of a memetic tribe or a person in such a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.649" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">way that they feel completely understood</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.390" end="00:15:44.260" style="s2">and then so you just you just be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:48.220" style="s2">method actor with their ideology so to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:49.959" style="s2">speak and also kind of to sink in what</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.220" end="00:15:52.089" style="s2">do they feel like on a felt sense level</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.959" end="00:15:53.620" style="s2">when they believe to be true what they</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.089" end="00:15:55.089" style="s2">believe to be true right and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.620" end="00:15:58.300" style="s2">do both of those things you can really</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.089" end="00:16:00.149" style="s2">talk to someone most people don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.300" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.149" end="00:16:05.740" style="s2">so I like having the Omega rule and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:08.019" style="s2">that type of stuff with a Medic tribe</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.740" end="00:16:09.339" style="s2">but if you do that you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.019" end="00:16:10.450" style="s2">trouble with the blue church if you do</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.339" end="00:16:11.740" style="s2">that with the conspiracy theory stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.450" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">because then you&#39;re just one of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.740" end="00:16:15.250" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s not good at you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.079" style="s2">canceled the big tech companies could</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.250" end="00:16:20.260" style="s2">ban you and YouTube all the type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.079" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">stuff alternatively criticism is</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.260" end="00:16:22.779" style="s2">important you know those just being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">performative agnostic is not a panacea</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.779" end="00:16:25.810" style="s2">you got to actually challenge people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:28.930" style="s2">truth claims because people are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.810" end="00:16:30.910" style="s2">and if you do that with the people with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.930" end="00:16:33.430" style="s2">the conspiratorial because there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.910" end="00:16:35.260" style="s2">is signal in the noise but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.430" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">of noise but if you challenge it with</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.260" end="00:16:39.640" style="s2">this sort of like religious intensity</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the bad guys you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.640" end="00:16:43.810" style="s2">the shells you know then they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">come after you so it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.810" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">damned if you do damned if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:49.810" style="s2">hear and it feels like a very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:51.550" style="s2">dangerous game to play especially when</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.810" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">you&#39;re sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.550" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">in a broadcast sort of way which rebel</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.410" style="s2">wisdoms doing so I feel what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:00.579" style="s2">feeling right now we&#39;re potentially</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.410" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">feeling all right I think I feel what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.579" end="00:17:06.189" style="s2">you&#39;re potentially feeling yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:08.020" style="s2">it feels like I try to personally put</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.189" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">out stuff that I feel that I can defend</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.020" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">that I can agree with and I can stand</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:17.949" style="s2">behind but what I feel like my</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:20.439" style="s2">particular perspective on this is is how</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.949" end="00:17:24.910" style="s2">do you how do you retain the best of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.439" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">values of the the existing structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.910" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">which at its best was was functional</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">like journalism at its best where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">really aiming at truth and it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:37.510" style="s2">to get both sides of the story and is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">offering people the right to reply so</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.510" end="00:17:40.809" style="s2">you&#39;re not putting out stuff without</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">putting it to them first which I tried</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.809" end="00:17:45.370" style="s2">to model in the in the it was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:46.630" style="s2">sort of show don&#39;t tell well I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:48.280" style="s2">tell people like this is how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.630" end="00:17:49.960" style="s2">supposed to do these things but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.280" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">it&#39;s far more</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.960" end="00:17:57.309" style="s2">valuable to demonstrate what good</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:17:59.710" style="s2">truth-seeking looks like there was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.309" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">there was a functioning system that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.710" end="00:18:03.970" style="s2">became corrupt it became corrupt it</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.970" style="s2">became hollowed out like increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.970" end="00:18:08.140" style="s2">hollowed out but when it worked and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.970" end="00:18:09.460" style="s2">probably the last time it worked</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.140" end="00:18:12.730" style="s2">properly in America right so is probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.460" end="00:18:14.289" style="s2">like the 1970s you had like journalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.730" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">had a really important function of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.289" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">holding power to account and it it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:24.130" style="s2">you had a small number of media channels</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.690" style="s2">so if you were asked to go on that media</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.130" end="00:18:27.970" style="s2">channel you would have to go on it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.690" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t go on it and you as a news</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.970" end="00:18:32.350" style="s2">P as a news person would say we asked</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">the government if someone was available</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.350" end="00:18:35.980" style="s2">and they said no one was available that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:38.649" style="s2">would that would sting that would kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.980" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">of be empty chairing someone we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.649" end="00:18:41.740" style="s2">in this kind of almost infinite media</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:43.779" style="s2">environment where there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.740" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">consequence of people to go on some and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.779" end="00:18:48.669" style="s2">not go on others</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.929" style="s2">it&#39;s accelerated the point where people</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.669" end="00:18:51.549" style="s2">are not asking difficult questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.929" end="00:18:52.419" style="s2">because they&#39;re worried that that person</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.549" end="00:18:54.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to come back on their</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.419" end="00:18:56.529" style="s2">channel and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.520" end="00:18:57.850" style="s2">so that&#39;s a failure condition of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.529" end="00:18:59.409" style="s2">alternative media but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.850" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">failure of the mainstream media now</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.409" end="00:19:05.610" style="s2">because there are so many more outlets</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:08.500" style="s2">for for everyone it&#39;s very hard even</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.610" end="00:19:12.610" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.500" end="00:19:14.649" style="s2">established truth seeking environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.610" end="00:19:15.700" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard then to hold people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.649" end="00:19:18.669" style="s2">account and need to be held to account</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.700" end="00:19:20.110" style="s2">because I think good truth seeking again</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.669" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">slipping into kind of the jargon that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.110" end="00:19:24.419" style="s2">we&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:28.179" style="s2">I think journalism and academia</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.419" end="00:19:31.590" style="s2">practiced in the way they are meant to</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.590" end="00:19:37.270" style="s2">Enterprise like it is it&#39;s a truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.690" end="00:19:39.700" style="s2">seeking enterprises and game a is all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.270" end="00:19:42.100" style="s2">the forces that have captured that truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.700" end="00:19:44.289" style="s2">seeking enterprise I think Brett and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.100" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">Eric talked about in the Rubin report</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.289" end="00:19:49.590" style="s2">really well as the truth-seeking cannot</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:52.630" style="s2">survive an encounter with market forces</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.590" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">but that&#39;s why I think the a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.630" end="00:19:57.549" style="s2">conspiracy theories the instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:20:00.549" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of like Bret again talks</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.549" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">about religion being metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.549" end="00:20:05.770" style="s2">and fat and literally false I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:07.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t fully buy that I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.770" end="00:20:08.620" style="s2">Christians are very upset about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:09.850" style="s2">definition but I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.620" end="00:20:12.280" style="s2">truth in that and I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.850" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">truth in for me a lot of the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.280" end="00:20:17.130" style="s2">extravagant conspiracy theories are</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:19.480" style="s2">metaphorically true and literally false</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.130" end="00:20:22.600" style="s2">and I think they&#39;re metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:24.490" style="s2">because we are in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.600" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">dysfunctional system that has rotted</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.490" end="00:20:31.540" style="s2">from the inside out for all of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:34.120" style="s2">systemic reasons I think I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.540" end="00:20:36.790" style="s2">people use the the thinker baudrillard</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.120" end="00:20:39.790" style="s2">to explain it as kind of his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.790" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">simulation that any structure becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.790" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">becomes hollowed out once you establish</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:45.580" style="s2">it as a structure if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:46.990" style="s2">truth-seeking structure what you end</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.580" end="00:20:49.060" style="s2">what ends up happening is that you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.990" end="00:20:51.040" style="s2">people who are maneuvering within that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.060" end="00:20:52.840" style="s2">structure for other reasons other rather</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.040" end="00:20:55.420" style="s2">than truth and it becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.840" end="00:20:57.790" style="s2">hollowed out and I think that especially</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.420" end="00:20:59.070" style="s2">in America is what we&#39;re seeing and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.790" end="00:21:01.330" style="s2">think a lot of people are perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.070" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">that a lot of these structures have</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.330" end="00:21:06.130" style="s2">essentially become hollowed out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:07.810" style="s2">the civilizational threat that I think a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.130" end="00:21:09.910" style="s2">lot of people are picking up and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.810" end="00:21:14.590" style="s2">a lot of them are sort of miss miss</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.910" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">diagnosing it so you and I spoke often</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.590" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">about like playing chess with council</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.210" end="00:21:24.460" style="s2">culture mm-hmm and like cancer culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:25.750" style="s2">is usually associated with social</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.460" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">justice activists or the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.750" end="00:21:32.230" style="s2">warriors or the world purity and it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.460" end="00:21:34.690" style="s2">interesting I think they used to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.230" end="00:21:36.700" style="s2">lot of momentum in culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.690" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">before firk Ovid now they&#39;re kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.700" end="00:21:40.330" style="s2">conspiracy theory stuff I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:43.270" style="s2">the mimetic tribe that has the momentum</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.330" end="00:21:45.370" style="s2">now and I would also argue that every</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.270" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">single mimetic tribe especially like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.370" end="00:21:51.430" style="s2">would say most mimetic tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.470" end="00:21:52.750" style="s2">disembody tribes in the deepest sense I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.430" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">think they all have their version of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.750" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2">castle culture so it&#39;s like what I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:00.520" style="s2">mentioning before is like that the blue</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:22:01.870" style="s2">church tribe you know they have their</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.520" end="00:22:04.270" style="s2">castle culture so if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.870" end="00:22:05.770" style="s2">signal hard against these conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.270" end="00:22:08.020" style="s2">theory stuff then you&#39;re gonna cancel by</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.770" end="00:22:10.180" style="s2">them the conspiracy theory stuff if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.020" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">even criticize them one inch you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.180" end="00:22:14.560" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get canceled by them so</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:17.149" style="s2">there&#39;s the cancer culture threat exists</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.560" end="00:22:19.519" style="s2">across the board with all mimetic try</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.149" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">so and that&#39;s the kind of a skill set to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.519" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">have like playing chess with cancer</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:25.789" style="s2">culture and I think you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:28.129" style="s2">out of anyone pretty good at it so far</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.789" end="00:22:30.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not not like I would what I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.129" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">when I read a lot of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.399" end="00:22:37.729" style="s2">treatments of conspiracy theories is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:41.719" style="s2">this kind of necessity of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.729" end="00:22:43.999" style="s2">signaling to the audience to say like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.719" end="00:22:46.849" style="s2">every other line is this conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.999" end="00:22:49.549" style="s2">theory that has no basis in fact like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.849" end="00:22:51.559" style="s2">and you have that feeling I know if I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.549" end="00:22:55.009" style="s2">was to write something for one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.559" end="00:22:56.359" style="s2">mainstream mainstream organs if I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.009" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">put that in it would be put in by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.359" end="00:23:01.429" style="s2">editor like they have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:03.710" style="s2">signal to everyone else in that Network</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.429" end="00:23:05.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s a kind of virtue signaling to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.710" end="00:23:07.369" style="s2">say we know this is not true oh and by</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.960" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">the way we need to reinforce that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.369" end="00:23:13.099" style="s2">is no link between five gene Corona and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:14.899" style="s2">just make that absolutely clear but with</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.099" end="00:23:17.359" style="s2">that kind of old-school journalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.899" end="00:23:20.029" style="s2">there&#39;s like a felt sense level of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.359" end="00:23:21.139" style="s2">knowingness even if they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.029" end="00:23:22.519" style="s2">even if they&#39;re earnest for the truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.139" end="00:23:25.879" style="s2">there&#39;s this felt sense of knowingness</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.519" end="00:23:28.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it kind of annoys me where</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.879" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">I think in order to be this was new</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.499" end="00:23:52.399" style="s2">run into narratives that provide that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.119" end="00:23:54.379" style="s2">certainty so that&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.399" end="00:23:57.289" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up for me right now is how</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.379" end="00:24:00.200" style="s2">do you earnestly sense make as a good</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.969" end="00:24:15.559" style="s2">then I like I like Jordan halls kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.519" end="00:24:17.469" style="s2">uh I&#39;m repurposing Jordan halls kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.559" end="00:24:20.239" style="s2">phrase and putting it as the axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.469" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">goal of stoicism if you will is being in</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.239" end="00:24:24.049" style="s2">right relationship with reality and if</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.750" end="00:24:36.150" style="s2">uncertainty of unknowingness and I think</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.930" end="00:24:54.330" style="s2">I guess the if we can tease out a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.760" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">question there is how do you sense make</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.330" end="00:24:59.240" style="s2">in a broadcast medium when the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:02.180" style="s2">that are going to consume your artifacts</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.180" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">uncertainty or annoyingness well the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:12.660" style="s2">first thing that comes to mind is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:17.160" style="s2">all going to have to develop that like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.660" end="00:25:19.260" style="s2">the I think it was Jamie wheel who used</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.160" end="00:25:20.790" style="s2">the Buckminster Fuller quote at the</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.010" end="00:25:47.430" style="s2">an existential project to develop that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:50.460" style="s2">in ourselves and to to because I because</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.110" end="00:26:12.060" style="s2">questions and then we&#39;re like that sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.930" end="00:26:14.370" style="s2">of polarization and tribal ization</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.060" end="00:26:16.740" style="s2">around these fixed identities the only</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.370" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">way out of it is to be able to to pull</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.740" end="00:26:20.970" style="s2">up to another level where you can see</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">complementary truths and understand that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.970" end="00:26:26.370" style="s2">they both hold essential values like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.330" end="00:26:28.800" style="s2">right and the left which I think we both</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.370" end="00:26:30.780" style="s2">agree is kind of a not a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.800" end="00:26:33.150" style="s2">helpful framework for understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.780" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">world right now like the value of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.150" end="00:26:42.210" style="s2">responsibility and of loyalty</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">accountability self empowerment that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:46.750" style="s2">right holds</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:49.420" style="s2">has to be balanced with care empathy</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.750" end="00:26:50.800" style="s2">that that the left holds and actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.420" end="00:26:52.120" style="s2">that the right has a different form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:57.160" style="s2">care and empathy that looks different</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.120" end="00:26:58.930" style="s2">from the left so all of these but it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.160" end="00:27:01.420" style="s2">it yeah but it&#39;s more of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.930" end="00:27:03.570" style="s2">individualist like that that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.420" end="00:27:07.480" style="s2">I we have to come out of these either/or</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.570" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">situations there is a concern about kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.480" end="00:27:15.040" style="s2">of this these conversations being too</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.970" style="s2">exclusive because of the terminology</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.040" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.970" end="00:27:20.200" style="s2">I was wondering it would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.190" end="00:27:24.370" style="s2">quite good to put together a glossary of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.200" end="00:27:26.860" style="s2">terms for the sort of broader may be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.370" end="00:27:30.100" style="s2">either rebel wisdom glossary of terms or</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.860" end="00:27:32.170" style="s2">a you&#39;ve got good coinage game like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:33.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of we&#39;ve given you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.170" end="00:27:35.500" style="s2">props in the past for having good</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.550" end="00:27:37.290" style="s2">coinage game and I think you even came</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.500" end="00:27:39.490" style="s2">up with coinage game as well as one so</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.290" end="00:27:42.130" style="s2">you even got good coinage game at</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.490" end="00:27:44.740" style="s2">creating coinage game like you come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.130" end="00:27:47.380" style="s2">with some very good sticky heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.740" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">like your culture war 2.0 piece I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.380" end="00:27:53.370" style="s2">was really really useful for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:55.990" style="s2">like the liminal war gray pills and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.370" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">mimetic mediation in particular the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.990" end="00:27:58.810" style="s2">that what&#39;s required is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:00.730" style="s2">mediation between these different</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.810" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">mimetic tribes who&#39;ve coalesced around</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.730" end="00:28:08.680" style="s2">different perspectives all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:12.040" style="s2">super important and super useful and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.680" end="00:28:13.270" style="s2">think yeah if anyone&#39;s watching this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:15.280" style="s2">wants to help on putting a glossary</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.270" end="00:28:16.840" style="s2">together then I think that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.280" end="00:28:23.020" style="s2">good artifact to put out there for</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.840" end="00:28:25.240" style="s2">people to to dive into we haven&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.020" end="00:28:27.820" style="s2">up with a good like this thing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.240" end="00:28:29.350" style="s2">it is this this space that I&#39;m in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.820" end="00:28:31.930" style="s2">you&#39;re in and various other people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.350" end="00:28:34.570" style="s2">in it is a thing but none of us have</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.930" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">come up with a particularly useful word</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.570" end="00:28:41.350" style="s2">for it game B is one sense making web is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.440" end="00:28:44.740" style="s2">another probably the sense making web I</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.350" end="00:28:46.180" style="s2">think is my favorite of all of the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:47.890" style="s2">I like the sense making web as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.180" end="00:28:49.480" style="s2">there&#39;s like all these adjacent sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.890" end="00:28:51.370" style="s2">like this game be the meta modern is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.480" end="00:28:53.260" style="s2">post rationalist but the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.370" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">sense making web kind of second umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.260" end="00:28:57.649" style="s2">term for all of them in a way that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.469" style="s2">I view it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.649" end="00:29:02.749" style="s2">every every Sunday at the store we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.469" end="00:29:04.940" style="s2">a mediation campfire with Jason Snyder</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.749" end="00:29:06.409" style="s2">and Jared Jaynes they have the both end</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.940" end="00:29:08.629" style="s2">podcast and it&#39;s basically a memetic</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.409" end="00:29:10.669" style="s2">mediation podcast and so the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.629" end="00:29:12.440" style="s2">we just gather around the digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.669" end="00:29:15.669" style="s2">campfire and is just talk about magnetic</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.440" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">mediation with a bunch of people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.669" end="00:29:19.489" style="s2">last session was pretty good like poke</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:21.949" style="s2">me at the edge of my thinking they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.489" end="00:29:24.769" style="s2">thinking about mimetic mediation what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.949" end="00:29:28.819" style="s2">the goal of it really because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.769" end="00:29:31.579" style="s2">this sort of instinctual pushback from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.819" end="00:29:33.499" style="s2">lot of nomadic tribes is the both sides</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.579" end="00:29:34.489" style="s2">ism argument or the all sides ISM</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.499" end="00:29:35.869" style="s2">argument like what are you saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.489" end="00:29:37.190" style="s2">everyone&#39;s just equal you got to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.869" end="00:29:40.459" style="s2">the middle ground between the two and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.190" end="00:29:42.889" style="s2">like nope right like no so for example</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.459" end="00:29:45.229" style="s2">like one of our friends Jessica she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.889" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">like a really good faith feminist but</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.229" end="00:29:50.149" style="s2">Jessica in a conversation was some kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:50.919" style="s2">of like a woman-hating insult Melissa to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.149" end="00:29:53.449" style="s2">actually have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.919" end="00:29:55.579" style="s2">propositional II and even like like</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.449" end="00:29:58.279" style="s2">emotional harm on Jessica side hands</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.579" end="00:30:00.619" style="s2">down right so it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.279" end="00:30:04.549" style="s2">somewhere in between in my opinion if</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.619" end="00:30:06.469" style="s2">they have a conversation but if the goal</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.549" end="00:30:08.690" style="s2">of memetic mediation is to get into</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.469" end="00:30:11.239" style="s2">right relationship with each meme with</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.690" end="00:30:13.399" style="s2">each tribe then maybe you know Jessica</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.239" end="00:30:15.559" style="s2">will move down you know a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.399" end="00:30:17.029" style="s2">little bit the the inside will move up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.559" end="00:30:19.339" style="s2">lot and then maybe they&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.029" end="00:30:21.469" style="s2">themselves in the right relationship but</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.339" end="00:30:23.089" style="s2">if you can somehow figure them figure</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.469" end="00:30:25.579" style="s2">out how to get them to the table and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.089" end="00:30:27.049" style="s2">that is like you know you almost won in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.579" end="00:30:29.899" style="s2">a way if you can actually get them to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.049" end="00:30:30.979" style="s2">the table and sit down and allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.899" end="00:30:32.499" style="s2">get in that state of unknowingness</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.979" end="00:30:34.879" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.499" end="00:30:36.019" style="s2">and so why I brought that up is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.879" end="00:30:40.399" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about like what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.019" end="00:30:44.359" style="s2">good mimetic mediator and Trust you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.399" end="00:30:47.059" style="s2">it&#39;s like the capacity to not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.359" end="00:30:49.369" style="s2">appear but to be trustworthy and to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.059" end="00:30:51.769" style="s2">model a certain behavior and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.369" end="00:30:53.389" style="s2">I like what like just a circle back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.769" end="00:30:58.519" style="s2">the appreciation I had for your nuance</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.389" end="00:31:00.109" style="s2">is that that engendered trust like when</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.519" end="00:31:01.309" style="s2">I saw you I started trusting you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.109" end="00:31:03.109" style="s2">I already trusted you but like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.309" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">like I if I didn&#39;t know you I would have</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.109" end="00:31:08.269" style="s2">felt I had the felt sense of trust there</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:10.160" style="s2">and so what&#39;s coming up right now is</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.269" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.160" end="00:31:18.110" style="s2">the way in order to approach this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:23.720" style="s2">existential project is to model being</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.110" end="00:31:27.740" style="s2">trustworthy in this liminal state and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.720" end="00:31:30.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the case how to do that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.740" end="00:31:32.510" style="s2">like daniel trachtenberg have talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.140" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">about in the in the war on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.510" end="00:31:39.049" style="s2">piece doing sense making like this the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">solution for the problem of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.049" end="00:31:45.650" style="s2">the problem of sense making requires a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:49.390" style="s2">huge amount of intimacy it requires a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.650" end="00:31:53.150" style="s2">huge amount of like honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.390" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">wrestling in public and another thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.150" end="00:31:58.870" style="s2">that a few people have said is like show</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:32:02.120" style="s2">me the people who are wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.870" end="00:32:03.470" style="s2">things in public don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.120" end="00:32:05.929" style="s2">see people who are certain about</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.470" end="00:32:08.179" style="s2">anything right now I want to see people</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.929" end="00:32:11.110" style="s2">who are clearly going through the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.179" end="00:32:14.350" style="s2">process of wrestling with difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.110" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">polarities that cannot be reconciled and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.350" end="00:32:20.690" style="s2">also that the intimacy thing is putting</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:22.429" style="s2">stuff out there that is vulnerable as</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.690" end="00:32:24.350" style="s2">well as like talking about your own in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.429" end="00:32:27.460" style="s2">process of what&#39;s going on when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.350" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">coming to these conclusions or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.460" end="00:32:32.570" style="s2">conclusions and saying I feel uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:35.530" style="s2">I feel and also if you fuck things up</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.570" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">say look I fucked that up</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.530" end="00:32:40.850" style="s2">like I don&#39;t for example just taking a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">taking a an example now it&#39;s like Brian</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.850" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">Rose I don&#39;t see a way back for him</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:48.140" style="s2">unless he&#39;s prepared to say actually I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:53.960" style="s2">fucked up the the worse angels of my</p>

<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">about this I wasn&#39;t completely honest</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.409" end="00:33:02.179" style="s2">about that but I did it because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.730" style="s2">passionate about this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.179" end="00:33:06.049" style="s2">believe or whatever whether whatever we</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:13.880" style="s2">sort of stuff that you and I and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.340" style="s2">rebel wisdom and many of the other</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.629" end="00:33:34.429" style="s2">things it&#39;s like and that requires</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.820" end="00:33:35.719" style="s2">immense emotional honesty and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.429" end="00:33:38.239" style="s2">intimacy to actually have those</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.719" end="00:33:40.519" style="s2">conversations and I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.239" end="00:33:42.200" style="s2">reaching towards is some kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.519" end="00:33:46.309" style="s2">doing what we&#39;ve done in those</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.200" end="00:33:49.849" style="s2">interpersonal contexts in a public forum</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.309" end="00:33:53.419" style="s2">around some of these bigger like</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.849" end="00:33:57.070" style="s2">cultural topics so this is really good</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.419" end="00:33:59.330" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know how to do it yet so</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.070" end="00:34:01.099" style="s2">I&#39;ll share I&#39;ll be intermittent sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.330" end="00:34:02.210" style="s2">like a personal story and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.099" end="00:34:05.570" style="s2">shared it with people for well share</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.210" end="00:34:08.869" style="s2">with with this audience is that before</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.570" end="00:34:11.480" style="s2">quote covet could happen I received some</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.869" end="00:34:12.679" style="s2">like bad news personally I won&#39;t almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.480" end="00:34:15.260" style="s2">share it now but I already shared it</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.679" end="00:34:18.200" style="s2">with you and it&#39;s about two months ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.260" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">now and I was devastated right I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.200" end="00:34:22.490" style="s2">just like laying on the sofa having like</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.200" style="s2">an existential crisis and the thought I</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.490" end="00:34:26.299" style="s2">came online is like what do I do now</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.200" end="00:34:29.240" style="s2">with my life I had no idea what to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.299" end="00:34:31.940" style="s2">with my life and there is judgment</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.240" end="00:34:33.500" style="s2">around that like I read so much books</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.940" end="00:34:35.419" style="s2">that all these spiritual practices all</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.500" end="00:34:36.799" style="s2">these goal-setting methodologies and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.419" end="00:34:40.579" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to live my life right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.799" end="00:34:43.309" style="s2">and they were shamed there and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.579" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">adjacent thought emerged like hey no one</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.309" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">else knows how to live my life either</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">and then that kind of like allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:51.980" style="s2">see the shame and it&#39;s sort of like just</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:52.789" style="s2">disappeared and then being a good stoic</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.980" end="00:34:55.039" style="s2">and wanting to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.789" end="00:34:56.389" style="s2">with reality I&#39;m like okay how do I be</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.039" end="00:34:58.430" style="s2">in right relationship not knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.389" end="00:34:59.750" style="s2">live my life and this is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.430" end="00:35:01.849" style="s2">starting to build an intimacy with</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.750" end="00:35:04.010" style="s2">unknowingness and I started my journals</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.849" end="00:35:07.279" style="s2">on the letter platformer I&#39;m just being</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.010" end="00:35:10.099" style="s2">radically honest and what&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.279" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">there is maybe this is a clip I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.099" end="00:35:12.980" style="s2">John and I mentioned it in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:15.710" style="s2">conversation we had in Toronto so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.980" end="00:35:17.150" style="s2">you could play this clip as well in one</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.710" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">of our circling sessions because John</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.150" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">and I and Luba Muir and a few other</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:21.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:22.849" style="s2">Lubin readers on the channel as well we</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.319" end="00:35:24.440" style="s2">were having a biweekly circling group</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.849" end="00:35:26.059" style="s2">authentic relating practice group in</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.440" end="00:35:28.309" style="s2">Toronto and then John had this like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.059" end="00:35:31.220" style="s2">really profound insight he said that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.309" end="00:35:33.109" style="s2">order to be someone&#39;s peer you not only</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.220" end="00:35:33.980" style="s2">have to have the capacity to peer</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.109" end="00:35:35.900" style="s2">through them</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:39.950" style="s2">but you have to allow them to peer</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.900" end="00:35:41.510" style="s2">through you and that&#39;s sort of like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.950" end="00:35:44.450" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about about just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.510" end="00:35:45.980" style="s2">like modeling this this this behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.450" end="00:35:46.609" style="s2">and I think this is exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.980" end="00:35:48.980" style="s2">doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.609" end="00:35:50.780" style="s2">we you and me kind of just putting</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.980" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">ourselves at the edge of our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.780" end="00:35:54.950" style="s2">here publicly being a little messy not</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">knowing where we&#39;re gonna go what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.950" end="00:36:00.890" style="s2">gonna merge but people see this and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.900" style="s2">they&#39;re like okay I imagine people see</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.890" end="00:36:05.000" style="s2">this like okay these people aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.900" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">bad right they&#39;re not like bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.000" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">actors and another thing that came up</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:13.369" style="s2">was that I like the word of the intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:16.220" style="s2">and also let&#39;s not be shy about being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.369" end="00:36:19.030" style="s2">little seductive right because really I</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.220" end="00:36:22.369" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m up for grabs right now I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.030" end="00:36:25.010" style="s2">feel like narratives could seduce me and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.369" end="00:36:26.359" style="s2">I&#39;m open to that reality and possibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.010" end="00:36:29.000" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re truthful ones and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.359" end="00:36:31.070" style="s2">so being up for grabs while you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.000" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">radically honest and truthful unknown</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.070" end="00:36:36.740" style="s2">state is kind of seductive certainly</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">your honesty and authenticity resonates</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.740" end="00:36:44.270" style="s2">with people that for me was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:48.170" style="s2">failure conditions of this like the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.270" end="00:36:50.690" style="s2">project was a that I didn&#39;t get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.170" end="00:36:55.400" style="s2">of that authenticity or that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.690" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">sense of people really wrestling it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.400" end="00:37:01.609" style="s2">really hard to show vulnerability when</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:06.319" style="s2">you have people who either do or you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.609" end="00:37:09.170" style="s2">suspect might weaponize and use that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.319" end="00:37:12.710" style="s2">against you like it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.170" end="00:37:14.780" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of an easy thing to do when</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.710" end="00:37:16.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a huge profile it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.780" end="00:37:18.680" style="s2">harder to do when you do have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.040" end="00:37:20.210" style="s2">profile and I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:21.710" style="s2">things that attracted me and attracted a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.210" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">lot of people I think to Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.710" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">originally was this sense that you did</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:29.990" style="s2">see him wrestling in real time with</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:31.579" style="s2">things like you you got he was the in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">way that I think that was why he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.579" end="00:37:38.089" style="s2">such a perfect intellectual for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:39.650" style="s2">digital ages that you sought you felt an</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.089" end="00:37:41.930" style="s2">intimacy with him and he felt him</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.650" end="00:37:45.410" style="s2">wrestling with what was going on with</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.930" end="00:37:47.470" style="s2">him and I remember once I saw him kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.410" end="00:37:49.840" style="s2">of musing on on</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.470" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">one of his Q&amp;A is about how he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.840" end="00:37:54.070" style="s2">feeling a lot more defensive and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.300" style="s2">more reactive around some of the press</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.070" end="00:37:57.550" style="s2">interviews that he was getting and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.300" end="00:38:00.609" style="s2">talked about it as a as a corruption of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.550" end="00:38:03.010" style="s2">his soul and I was like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.609" end="00:38:05.740" style="s2">really that&#39;s the kind of honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.010" end="00:38:07.540" style="s2">the kind of personal willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.740" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">share his own personal process that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.540" end="00:38:12.580" style="s2">think was why he was so successful and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:15.190" style="s2">why a lot of people felt this real</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.580" end="00:38:18.010" style="s2">connection to him and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.190" end="00:38:20.680" style="s2">seen that I can&#39;t think of many other</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.010" end="00:38:25.270" style="s2">people who&#39;ve done that I might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.680" end="00:38:27.840" style="s2">there may be others yeah I agree I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.270" end="00:38:31.750" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s a different beast in that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.840" end="00:38:34.090" style="s2">and you know so like you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.750" end="00:38:36.490" style="s2">mentioned this on my journals now and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.090" end="00:38:37.869" style="s2">still I haven&#39;t mentioned this publicly</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.490" end="00:38:40.450" style="s2">like rebel wisdom but he was my</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.869" end="00:38:43.330" style="s2">therapist for two years before he became</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.450" end="00:38:46.150" style="s2">famous and you know so I have a great</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.330" end="00:38:49.240" style="s2">love for him he helped me out but I will</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.150" end="00:38:51.070" style="s2">I guess I will criticize him here if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.240" end="00:38:52.810" style="s2">want to call it criticism I do agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.070" end="00:38:56.770" style="s2">with you that he has this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.810" end="00:38:58.150" style="s2">radical form of truthfulness like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.770" end="00:38:59.260" style="s2">Kathy Newman interview just displayed</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.150" end="00:39:02.410" style="s2">that with brilliance and you did a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.260" end="00:39:03.580" style="s2">documentary about that and people</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.410" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen that before like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.580" end="00:39:07.330" style="s2">going on here and then the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:08.980" style="s2">she has like agents and stuff right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.330" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">so I call him like is it that Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.980" end="00:39:12.790" style="s2">bouncers that he has from the blue</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:16.180" style="s2">church I imagine they have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.790" end="00:39:17.770" style="s2">containing a guy like Peterson fully</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.180" end="00:39:22.030" style="s2">because he&#39;s so committed to his</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.770" end="00:39:23.140" style="s2">truthfulness muscle but when I have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.030" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">sense that I could be wrong here it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.140" end="00:39:26.040" style="s2">could be uncharitable but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">always come from a place of love</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.040" end="00:39:30.040" style="s2">especially when he&#39;s criticizing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">social justice activists or whether I</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:35.260" style="s2">don&#39;t feel he&#39;s coming from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2">love and those moments and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.260" end="00:39:39.310" style="s2">order to be intimate and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.020" end="00:39:40.810" style="s2">seductive there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.310" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">being so doctor especially if it comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.810" end="00:39:49.290" style="s2">about organically is being truthful in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:52.180" style="s2">this state of unknowingness with love</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:55.089" style="s2">mm-hmm and this is was it like when I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.180" end="00:39:56.890" style="s2">did the the workshop but rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.089" end="00:39:59.349" style="s2">when I was in the men&#39;s group in in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.890" end="00:40:01.300" style="s2">London which is brilliant it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.349" end="00:40:03.250" style="s2">about the mind is about the heart</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.300" end="00:40:05.860" style="s2">I want to speak from the heart just as</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.250" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking from the mind and if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.860" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">can do that then people will hear yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:14.110" style="s2">mean I I agree I think in the second</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:17.500" style="s2">interview I did with with him I did ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.110" end="00:40:21.550" style="s2">him I did push him a little bit on on</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.500" end="00:40:24.940" style="s2">that like his reactivity towards the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.550" end="00:40:29.800" style="s2">sort of social justice warriors or and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.940" end="00:40:34.540" style="s2">this this sense of also because he</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.800" end="00:40:37.210" style="s2">argues himself that I people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.540" end="00:40:40.090" style="s2">ideas ideas have people so if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.210" end="00:40:43.270" style="s2">case why why the aggression towards the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.090" end="00:40:46.330" style="s2">people can we have that compassion</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.270" end="00:40:47.650" style="s2">towards people despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.330" end="00:40:48.820" style="s2">disagreeing with their actions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.650" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">despite the fact that we may disagree</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.820" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">with that their thoughts and their</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.470" end="00:40:57.370" style="s2">beliefs so yeah I think I mean I&#39;d agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:40:59.460" style="s2">with that I feel something I think I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.370" end="00:41:06.460" style="s2">have said before I would like to put out</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.460" end="00:41:08.620" style="s2">another another film about the looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.460" end="00:41:12.850" style="s2">back on those two years of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.620" end="00:41:16.600" style="s2">the the Jordan Pederson phenomenon which</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.850" end="00:41:18.610" style="s2">we all hope is not complete but sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.600" end="00:41:21.700" style="s2">just looking on that at that trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.610" end="00:41:25.690" style="s2">some of the the people who criticized</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.700" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">him and and I&#39;d love to do it with an</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.690" end="00:41:30.660" style="s2">interview with with him I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:35.550" style="s2">whether that&#39;s possible or or not but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.660" end="00:41:40.450" style="s2">felt I have had some criticisms and some</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.550" end="00:41:46.810" style="s2">concerns and I felt that it would be in</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.450" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2">some sense I think disloyal or unfair to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.810" end="00:41:54.100" style="s2">do to put out those criticisms without</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:56.350" style="s2">putting them to him personally then we</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.100" end="00:42:00.970" style="s2">we have put out some films on honourable</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.350" end="00:42:02.830" style="s2">wisdom that have been critical and and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.970" end="00:42:04.990" style="s2">made sure I sent them to him personally</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.830" end="00:42:07.660" style="s2">I sent them to him and Tammy but this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.990" end="00:42:12.390" style="s2">a couple of years ago now but but I felt</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:12.390" style="s2">like I wanted to do that and a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:20.140" style="s2">yeah really upfront way and he responded</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.890" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">well to those like that they responded</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.140" end="00:42:25.690" style="s2">well to those and took it in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:30.340" style="s2">spirit to which it was intended as far</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.690" end="00:42:30.790" style="s2">as I know so yeah yeah I&#39;m the buter</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.340" end="00:42:33.430" style="s2">Singh</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.790" end="00:42:34.930" style="s2">you know situations another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.430" end="00:42:36.730" style="s2">is so hard to speak with nuance just</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.930" end="00:42:39.400" style="s2">like I was just a conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.730" end="00:42:41.590" style="s2">stuff you know it&#39;s hey and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.400" end="00:42:43.270" style="s2">damned if you don&#39;t take things yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.590" end="00:42:45.250" style="s2">glad we did this I felt like it was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.270" end="00:42:47.830" style="s2">the right format to start articulating</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.250" end="00:42:52.060" style="s2">some of this stuff because it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.830" end="00:42:55.110" style="s2">hard it&#39;s really hard as well to when</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.060" end="00:43:01.180" style="s2">you&#39;re articulating something difficult</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.110" end="00:43:03.610" style="s2">for the first time yourself it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.180" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">come up against like the broadcaster in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.610" end="00:43:09.880" style="s2">me and that the kind of perfectionist in</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">me wants it to be perfect and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.880" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">difficult for it to be perfect when</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:13.840" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of still in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:18.570" style="s2">thinking about what it is you actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.840" end="00:43:22.660" style="s2">think and how it needs to be framed so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.570" end="00:43:24.250" style="s2">yeah I feel I feel like just but in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.660" end="00:43:26.320" style="s2">process of articulating a lot of it kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.250" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">of lands and and you you learn what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.320" end="00:43:30.790" style="s2">think while you&#39;re speaking a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:32.290" style="s2">time so this is this is another part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.790" end="00:43:35.140" style="s2">this of this question that you asked</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.290" end="00:43:38.590" style="s2">before about what is what is the nature</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.140" end="00:43:44.100" style="s2">like the nature of this enterprise has</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.590" end="00:43:47.050" style="s2">to be real-time sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.100" end="00:43:49.270" style="s2">articulation of things that may not have</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.050" end="00:43:50.740" style="s2">been fully you certainly I mean other</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.270" end="00:43:53.230" style="s2">people probably ever have expressed it</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.740" end="00:43:56.770" style="s2">far better than then I can and have in</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.230" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">this conversation but we all need to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.770" end="00:44:00.910" style="s2">at the edge of our thinking at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.390" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">of our articulation where we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.910" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">trying to find the words for it as where</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:11.380" style="s2">we&#39;re talking that&#39;s that&#39;s the nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:14.110" style="s2">of the I&#39;m really clear that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.380" end="00:44:16.810" style="s2">nature of the exploration that we all</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.110" end="00:44:21.580" style="s2">need to go on is to bring ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.810" end="00:44:23.710" style="s2">that edge because the the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.580" end="00:44:27.600" style="s2">crisis that we are at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.710" end="00:44:27.600" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.640" end="00:44:31.640" style="s2">like I think we&#39;re all perceiving all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.110" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">us in this space of perceiving that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.640" end="00:44:39.350" style="s2">this is it this is the this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.700" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">hopefully the phase shift but</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.350" end="00:44:46.130" style="s2">potentially something more catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:48.050" style="s2">and the only what none of us know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.130" end="00:44:50.360" style="s2">the what the world on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.050" end="00:44:53.150" style="s2">it looks like the only way to get there</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.360" end="00:44:57.860" style="s2">is by articulating in real time and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.150" end="00:45:01.120" style="s2">trying to trying to yeah trying to tune</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.860" end="00:45:05.270" style="s2">in to what wants to emerge through us</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.120" end="00:45:07.010" style="s2">yeah yeah and I feel like I&#39;m sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.270" end="00:45:09.170" style="s2">it now when I was just observing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.010" end="00:45:10.850" style="s2">culture war like kinetic tribes but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.170" end="00:45:12.350" style="s2">actually want to get tribal now I want</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.850" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">to be I think I&#39;m gonna find my tribe</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.350" end="00:45:16.760" style="s2">the embody try and then the pure sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">or the fight communitas I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.760" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">where the beauty is and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.790" style="s2">have to be truthful or to get there and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:25.060" style="s2">then before we go that I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.790" end="00:45:28.610" style="s2">like just say something about well you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.060" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like that kind of like what</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.610" end="00:45:32.900" style="s2">you said about your perfectionist desire</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:34.340" style="s2">and and then you know like the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.900" end="00:45:36.830" style="s2">that you put on yourself produce really</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.340" end="00:45:38.300" style="s2">really good content it puts you in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.830" end="00:45:40.340" style="s2">position out of the sense of making</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.300" end="00:45:42.770" style="s2">web-like rebel wisdom a lot of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.340" end="00:45:45.500" style="s2">eyes with a cool standard you knows a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.770" end="00:45:47.060" style="s2">lot of good stuff out there and we know</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.500" end="00:45:49.070" style="s2">all the players in the space we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.060" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">friends with them but you guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.070" end="00:45:53.390" style="s2">you put yourself in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:56.570" style="s2">you have most eyes on you in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.390" end="00:45:59.180" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you know the cliche</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.570" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">line like with you know great power</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.180" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">comes great responsibility and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.130" end="00:46:06.620" style="s2">now you&#39;re in a situation this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:08.780" style="s2">war we&#39;re almost sacrificing that sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.620" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">of that that perfectionist tendency in</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.780" end="00:46:12.170" style="s2">front of others it&#39;s like an act of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:14.090" style="s2">sacrifice it&#39;s like the zone hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:15.650" style="s2">journey that that you&#39;re on here which</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.090" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2">at which I find quite delicious</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.650" end="00:46:25.790" style="s2">if true well who knows I mean the danger</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.150" end="00:46:28.220" style="s2">of all of this is is inflation and not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.790" end="00:46:31.820" style="s2">being held accountable and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.220" end="00:46:33.770" style="s2">these things like I mean I do feel that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.820" end="00:46:39.080" style="s2">like I certainly in myself feel that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.770" end="00:46:39.950" style="s2">sense of real okay this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.080" end="00:46:42.349" style="s2">we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.950" end="00:46:45.470" style="s2">building up - we&#39;ve all had this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.349" end="00:46:50.359" style="s2">sense of this was coming</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.470" end="00:46:51.710" style="s2">whatever this was this was coming we</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.359" end="00:46:53.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t know it&#39;s gonna be a pandemic but</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.710" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">the but this sort of sits this his</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">system was was on overload and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:00.890" style="s2">something like this was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:02.540" style="s2">and so yeah I feel that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.890" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">alignment that sense of like real</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.540" end="00:47:10.040" style="s2">urgency and that sense of kind of it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:14.900" style="s2">we all need to find that if like is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.040" end="00:47:17.210" style="s2">like if not us who really what what</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.900" end="00:47:21.579" style="s2">while also being aware that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.210" end="00:47:24.020" style="s2">risk of inflation and the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.579" end="00:47:26.420" style="s2">bullshitting ourselves and the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.020" end="00:47:28.820" style="s2">why all of those things come in as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.420" end="00:47:31.250" style="s2">well let&#39;s take Brian Rose as an example</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.820" end="00:47:33.589" style="s2">like that to me is like perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.250" end="00:47:36.890" style="s2">its inflation it&#39;s getting caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.589" end="00:47:39.589" style="s2">some kind of archetypal struggle of only</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.890" end="00:47:43.430" style="s2">seeing sort of one side of the coin and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.589" end="00:47:44.750" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a we see it he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.430" end="00:47:46.730" style="s2">the only one like it we see it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.750" end="00:47:49.579" style="s2">it&#39;s like that for me is a really tragic</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.730" end="00:47:52.940" style="s2">trajectory it&#39;s identifying oneself with</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.579" end="00:47:54.890" style="s2">one side of an archetype it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.940" end="00:47:57.980" style="s2">allowing the inflation its kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.890" end="00:47:59.569" style="s2">manic energy of the moment and being</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.980" end="00:48:02.810" style="s2">overwhelmed by the manic energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.569" end="00:48:05.150" style="s2">moment and then the ego grasping onto</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.810" end="00:48:07.910" style="s2">this rather than allowing it to pass</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.150" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">through and thinking that we like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.910" end="00:48:14.810" style="s2">messianic fervor that comes in as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">we talk to like psychedelic narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.810" end="00:48:19.930" style="s2">all these sort of things it&#39;s like being</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:23.930" style="s2">aware that that&#39;s that&#39;s a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.930" end="00:48:25.880" style="s2">territory as well and like I think if</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.930" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">you have this your primary relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.880" end="00:48:31.490" style="s2">with others is asymmetrical via</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:35.240" style="s2">broadcast media then I think you can get</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.490" end="00:48:40.819" style="s2">captured by ego very easily but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.240" end="00:48:42.290" style="s2">with with us like we&#39;ve talked about ego</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.819" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">before being captured by ego and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.290" end="00:48:45.500" style="s2">might have different conceptions of ego</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:47.510" style="s2">but I think you can get in right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.500" end="00:48:50.270" style="s2">relationship with ego in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.510" end="00:48:53.089" style="s2">you are still ambitious enough to make a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.270" end="00:48:53.960" style="s2">difference in the world but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.089" end="00:48:56.930" style="s2">identify it</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.960" end="00:48:59.780" style="s2">completely in order to be kept in check</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.930" end="00:49:02.630" style="s2">in a trust comes to mind like do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.780" end="00:49:04.490" style="s2">trust our people our tribe our audience</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.630" end="00:49:07.400" style="s2">to keep each other to keep us in check</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.490" end="00:49:09.290" style="s2">like I trust you to call me out on my</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.400" end="00:49:11.150" style="s2">bullshit and you have and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.290" end="00:49:13.250" style="s2">trust me to call you on your bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.150" end="00:49:16.430" style="s2">which I have right so we trust each</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.250" end="00:49:17.809" style="s2">other there and we&#39;re not submitting</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.430" end="00:49:19.250" style="s2">each other to each other because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.809" end="00:49:21.559" style="s2">know we want to be nice or likable or</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.250" end="00:49:25.030" style="s2">whatnot and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.559" end="00:49:27.020" style="s2">and not only modeled sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.030" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">transparency and truthfulness with</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.020" end="00:49:34.040" style="s2">ourselves but also in dialogue OHS and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">dialogue together yeah yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.040" end="00:49:38.119" style="s2">whole new I know you have to go so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:40.339" style="s2">is a whole new topic but but all I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.119" end="00:49:45.710" style="s2">say on that is like I don&#39;t think people</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.339" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">realize just how how important that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.710" end="00:49:53.630" style="s2">and how much it&#39;s required like that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:54.980" style="s2">all like the amount of work the more</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.630" end="00:49:56.599" style="s2">that I&#39;ve got into sort of personal</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.980" end="00:49:58.520" style="s2">growth work and accountability and all</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.599" end="00:50:01.670" style="s2">of that the more I&#39;ve realized like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.520" end="00:50:03.140" style="s2">never ends like in any in any good</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:05.809" style="s2">relationship and I think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.140" end="00:50:07.730" style="s2">need within the sort of I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.809" end="00:50:09.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve got anywhere near enough of it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.730" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">the in the web of people that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.500" end="00:50:17.020" style="s2">talking about I think there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:19.490" style="s2">there&#39;s way too much proxying of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.020" end="00:50:21.799" style="s2">authority to some key nodes there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.490" end="00:50:24.440" style="s2">too much lack of kind of accountability</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.799" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">and willingness to kind of test our</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.440" end="00:50:28.579" style="s2">ideas and test our own bullshit against</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.829" style="s2">each other there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.579" end="00:50:33.619" style="s2">communication there&#39;s too many people</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.829" end="00:50:35.930" style="s2">who are who just don&#39;t have any concept</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.619" end="00:50:38.900" style="s2">of what this kind of path of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.930" end="00:50:41.089" style="s2">a growth looks like and back away from</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.900" end="00:50:43.309" style="s2">from anything that feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.089" end="00:50:44.599" style="s2">challenges their their personality or</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.309" end="00:50:46.040" style="s2">their ego structure it&#39;s right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.599" end="00:50:47.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a you&#39;ve got a fucking steer</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.040" end="00:50:50.630" style="s2">into it you&#39;ve got to go into the fire</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.420" end="00:50:53.450" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s only those of us who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.630" end="00:50:55.609" style="s2">done quite a lot of that in a work that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.450" end="00:50:59.990" style="s2">realize just how difficult that is and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.609" end="00:51:01.730" style="s2">how much how much we need to to steer</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.990" end="00:51:03.140" style="s2">into that yeah that&#39;s what that&#39;s all</p>
