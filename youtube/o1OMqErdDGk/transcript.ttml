<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">jordan peterson i about six seven months</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:07.049" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve been following Jordan Peterson for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.049" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">about a year and I&#39;d been blogging about</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">him I&#39;ve had a blog for years and at</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">some point I was reading Neil postman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">rereading the book I had read in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">I&#39;m using ourselves to death which talks</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">about media and the way it changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">messages and shapes message and empowers</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">message and I thought I should probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:29.070" style="s2">do a video about Jordan Peterson and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">made a couple of them and I had had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.070" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">little I had 15 subscribers on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">youtube channel where I was doing a show</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">with Freddy Schuler who you probably met</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">this morning just something because he</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">wanted to do a TV show with me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">that&#39;s all I had done and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">there were more people watching my</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">channel and I began getting letters from</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">people talking about how helpful my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">commentary had been for them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">understand Jordan Peterson and frame him</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">within a Christian context so I kept</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">doing it and I&#39;ve continued to do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.880" style="s2">since then and I&#39;ve watched many of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">videos and very much appreciated them so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.880" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">here we are it&#39;s quite a surprise to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">yeah cuz I guess my journey with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">Peterson as well started probably about</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:15.819" style="s2">a year ago my first</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">him wrote a blog about him and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.819" end="00:02:22.940" style="s2">luckily got to interview him in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:23.930" style="s2">and since then like I I have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.940" end="00:02:25.580" style="s2">like that there&#39;s Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.930" end="00:02:28.099" style="s2">himself and then there&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.580" end="00:02:31.819" style="s2">represents and for me what I think he</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.099" end="00:02:33.260" style="s2">represents is a kind of potential for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.819" end="00:02:36.380" style="s2">the reintegration of a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.260" end="00:02:38.420" style="s2">tradition that I think the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.380" end="00:02:39.739" style="s2">world has kind of lost and potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.420" end="00:02:41.810" style="s2">kind of reintegration of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.739" end="00:02:43.250" style="s2">itself which is what I think I saw when</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.810" end="00:02:45.819" style="s2">I first saw him I&#39;m like wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.250" end="00:02:48.019" style="s2">such a vital message for the times and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.819" end="00:02:49.819" style="s2">you you&#39;re coming from over I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.019" end="00:02:51.110" style="s2">very different place in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.819" end="00:02:53.569" style="s2">live in that sacred world you live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.110" end="00:02:56.269" style="s2">that Christian world so what what does</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.569" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">he represent to you the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.269" end="00:03:02.870" style="s2">saw was their Christians Christians read</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">this book that says we live under a dome</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.870" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">and God is up and the world is down and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:12.170" style="s2">there&#39;s people under the world they live</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">in that space during church and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.170" end="00:03:14.989" style="s2">they go out into the world and we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:17.980" style="s2">a globe and we&#39;re flying through space</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.989" end="00:03:20.120" style="s2">and when I listen to Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.980" end="00:03:22.820" style="s2">church has always talked about God</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.120" end="00:03:25.190" style="s2">coming from above and that right now is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.820" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">getting nowhere with huge groups of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.190" end="00:03:30.079" style="s2">people and here I Jordan Peterson was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">coming from below and he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.079" end="00:03:34.549" style="s2">connect heaven and earth again which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">where the why the conversation always</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:39.709" style="s2">goes back to the physical nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:42.470" style="s2">resurrection so I watched this and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.709" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">thought this is and then I listened to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.470" end="00:03:46.639" style="s2">lot of people watching him saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:49.250" style="s2">interested in going to church and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.639" end="00:03:51.380" style="s2">interested in exploring this and it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.250" end="00:03:53.690" style="s2">very clear Jordan Peterson was rocketing</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.380" end="00:03:55.700" style="s2">up the hierarchy and not everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.690" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">going to get a chance to sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.700" end="00:04:02.540" style="s2">talk to him and I&#39;m available and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:05.090" style="s2">they find me and so then as a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.540" end="00:04:07.400" style="s2">minister I&#39;m a proxy that&#39;s right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.090" end="00:04:09.650" style="s2">I&#39;m down I&#39;m way down at the low end of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.400" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">the feeding chain which is okay by me</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.650" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">I like my pastor small Church I like</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:15.829" style="s2">small things what&#39;s exciting about it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">we get to do what we&#39;re doing now</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.829" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">sitting talking face-to-face this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:23.180" style="s2">what I enjoy yeah lots of things to pick</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:25.099" style="s2">up on you remind me when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.180" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">sort of Peterson talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.099" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">bottom-up nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:32.660" style="s2">I guess the bottom-up nature of religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">and religious revelation you might say</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.660" end="00:04:38.630" style="s2">there&#39;s an echo of his conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">ben shapiro when ben shapiro was talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.630" end="00:04:44.419" style="s2">about like he&#39;s obviously very into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:46.810" style="s2">kind of jewish revelation and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.419" end="00:04:49.340" style="s2">biblical stories being true and he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.810" end="00:04:51.260" style="s2">Peterson was saying yes but you can also</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.340" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">get there another way there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.260" end="00:04:55.820" style="s2">some sense in that the revelation from</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.940" end="00:04:57.860" style="s2">below like evolved morality and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.820" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">psychological reality of the stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.860" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">like a very human level also matches</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">this sort of revelation from above of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:09.110" style="s2">this is somehow divinely like I guess in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:10.850" style="s2">in the history in history it would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.110" end="00:05:13.190" style="s2">been this is these have come from God</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.850" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s a sense of them both</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.190" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">coming together in some sense very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:20.450" style="s2">so the john calvin so i&#39;m a Calvinist</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:23.979" style="s2">pastor calls the the census tamanna tata</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.450" end="00:05:28.660" style="s2">switch says that god has built into us a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:31.669" style="s2">way to hear him I hadn&#39;t heard someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.660" end="00:05:33.020" style="s2">making I hadn&#39;t heard someone making a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.669" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">compelling case like this that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.020" end="00:05:36.110" style="s2">actually getting traction with people</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:38.210" style="s2">and was clear Peterson was getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.110" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">traction and so then I said I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.210" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">listen to this guy I&#39;ve got to figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.620" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">out what he&#39;s saying and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:48.350" style="s2">working and what how I should respond to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:49.700" style="s2">what&#39;s happening around him how is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.350" end="00:05:51.140" style="s2">being as well because Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.700" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">obviously began it been getting more and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.140" end="00:05:57.080" style="s2">more controversial and I&#39;ve kind of felt</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">this as well sort of like you end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.080" end="00:05:59.960" style="s2">getting in into conversations no he</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:03.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.960" end="00:06:07.430" style="s2">how is how is that being like a people</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.710" end="00:06:10.630" style="s2">started arguing with you or judging what</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.430" end="00:06:13.130" style="s2">you&#39;re saying or how does that mean I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.630" end="00:06:15.020" style="s2">deeply suspect there are a number of</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.890" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">a long time eventually it tapered off</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:42.370" style="s2">and I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s been at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:44.770" style="s2">manageable pace and so I can both take</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">for church and it&#39;s just a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.370" end="00:13:15.730" style="s2">and my heart my heart bleeds when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:17.590" style="s2">that because what I would want as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.730" end="00:13:19.130" style="s2">Christian pastor would be that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.590" end="00:13:21.530" style="s2">would find a church</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.130" end="00:13:23.450" style="s2">that could help them sort themselves out</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.530" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">where they could find community where</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.450" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">they could without fear explore whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:34.100" style="s2">crazy idea they have and talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:35.450" style="s2">and and work that through and most</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.100" end="00:13:38.660" style="s2">churches simply aren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.450" end="00:13:40.910" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it&#39;s a tragedy mmm they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.660" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">not interested I&#39;m not capable or what</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.910" end="00:13:46.070" style="s2">do you both how many pastors listen to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:51.490" style="s2">Jordan Peterson some more than will</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:55.160" style="s2">admit to it but I have a small highly</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.490" end="00:13:57.230" style="s2">permission giving Church and so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.160" end="00:14:00.470" style="s2">have a meet up here in a few hours where</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.230" end="00:14:03.290" style="s2">you know 15 to 20 people will come</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.470" end="00:14:06.500" style="s2">together and we won&#39;t pray we won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.290" end="00:14:08.450" style="s2">communion I had one of my old-timers</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.500" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">stop in and listen once and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.450" end="00:14:13.850" style="s2">he knew what was going on but he trusts</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:14.570" style="s2">me so if the pastor&#39;s doing this it must</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.850" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">be okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.570" end="00:14:19.520" style="s2">and people are working on their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:23.300" style="s2">will they become Christians certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.520" end="00:14:26.090" style="s2">not all of them but we opened the church</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.300" end="00:14:27.740" style="s2">for a meetings all kinds of good things</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.090" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">for the community this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.740" end="00:14:32.300" style="s2">thing for the community this is really</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:36.250" style="s2">interesting to me it&#39;s like I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.300" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real tension in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.250" end="00:14:40.580" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:42.770" style="s2">Christianity and the Christian Church</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.580" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t describe himself as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.770" end="00:14:47.870" style="s2">Christian and I&#39;d love to get your kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:50.840" style="s2">of thoughts on that because he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.870" end="00:14:52.520" style="s2">a like he&#39;s pulling people towards a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.840" end="00:14:55.100" style="s2">deeper appreciation of the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.520" end="00:14:57.940" style="s2">story but it&#39;s in a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.100" end="00:15:00.110" style="s2">way to the church</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.940" end="00:15:01.700" style="s2">can you pull that apart for me because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.110" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">can sort of sense there&#39;s a tension here</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.700" end="00:15:07.460" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really understand it some</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">some of the tension some of the tension</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.460" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">is in Christianity itself what is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.620" end="00:15:13.430" style="s2">Christian if you grew up in the Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:14.930" style="s2">world and you came to North America you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.430" end="00:15:16.760" style="s2">would say almost everyone here is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.930" end="00:15:18.230" style="s2">Christian and if you pull someone off</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.760" end="00:15:20.630" style="s2">the street say are you a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.230" end="00:15:22.670" style="s2">they might say yes they might say no so</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.630" end="00:15:23.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous amount of ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.670" end="00:15:28.460" style="s2">in terms of the definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.960" end="00:15:31.250" style="s2">Christian Peterson Jonathan pooja has</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.460" end="00:15:32.900" style="s2">one of the better arguments I think he</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.250" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">says he&#39;s like Cyrus he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.900" end="00:15:38.390" style="s2">who was this Persian Emperor who in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:40.100" style="s2">Book of Isaiah Isaiah calls him the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.390" end="00:15:41.870" style="s2">servant of the Lord which is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.100" end="00:15:43.880" style="s2">tremendously high saying in the Book of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.870" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">Isaiah which then eventually gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.880" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">referred to Jesus but Cyrus is this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">pagan Persian Emperor who has hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:55.250" style="s2">of wives and you know destroys nations</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:57.620" style="s2">and all of this but God used Cyrus to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.250" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">send the Jews back to rebuild the temple</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.620" end="00:16:02.630" style="s2">and Jonathan pojo and his Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">Orthodox frame I can see where that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.630" end="00:16:07.310" style="s2">really works for him I see a John the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">Baptist vibe in Jordan Peterson John a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.310" end="00:16:10.010" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t know John the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:12.550" style="s2">Baptist had a following that extended a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.010" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">couple of centuries he was a huge deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.550" end="00:16:19.220" style="s2">but then you know what did Jesus do and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">what followed Jesus so Christians have</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.220" end="00:16:23.089" style="s2">this huge debate people write me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">praying for Jordan Peterson it becomes a</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">he&#39;d better not become a Christian now</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.690" end="00:16:30.529" style="s2">because none of the atheists will listen</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:32.900" style="s2">to him well I&#39;m content to let Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.529" end="00:16:34.520" style="s2">Peterson B Jordan Peterson and let God</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.620" end="00:16:49.490" style="s2">you might put them in a category they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.870" end="00:16:50.930" style="s2">in the Christian Reformed Church if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.490" end="00:16:54.170" style="s2">know enough Christian inform doctrine</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.170" end="00:17:00.610" style="s2">there are a hodgepodge of all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.570" end="00:17:03.140" style="s2">beliefs why isn&#39;t Jordan Peterson so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.610" end="00:17:07.339" style="s2">I&#39;m comfortable not answering the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.140" end="00:17:09.050" style="s2">question I guess I got a sense that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.339" end="00:17:11.209" style="s2">for me certainly like I always had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.050" end="00:17:13.579" style="s2">sort of spiritual leanings I studied</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.209" end="00:17:15.860" style="s2">Buddhism and Hinduism study philosophy</p>

<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t really until listening to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.319" end="00:17:25.069" style="s2">Peterson that I kind of was really able</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">to frame the Christian story in a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.069" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">way and really understand the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:33.170" style="s2">sophistication of the Christian kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:34.610" style="s2">metaphors and the idea of dying to your</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.170" end="00:17:36.860" style="s2">cert like that kind of the idea of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.750" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s a sense that he&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.480" end="00:17:53.800" style="s2">pointing away to an integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:56.410" style="s2">Christian story that points beyond it in</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.800" end="00:17:58.330" style="s2">some ways that that I wonder if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.410" end="00:18:00.700" style="s2">kind of threatening to the idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.330" end="00:18:03.640" style="s2">the Christian Church based around a set</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.700" end="00:18:05.700" style="s2">of I&#39;d an ideology as much as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.640" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">fixed idea or a dogma</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.700" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">he&#39;s almost pointing beyond that in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:13.210" style="s2">ways that is that part of the tension</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:17.470" style="s2">maybe I when I listen to him I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.210" end="00:18:19.810" style="s2">he&#39;s actually only going halfway for</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.470" end="00:18:24.340" style="s2">example if you listen closely to his</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.810" end="00:18:27.640" style="s2">Easter videos the gospel for him is pick</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.340" end="00:18:29.860" style="s2">up your very heavy cross and drag it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.640" end="00:18:32.230" style="s2">uphill and if you do so you will</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.860" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">experience meaning and you&#39;ll sort out</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.230" end="00:18:37.390" style="s2">your life and you&#39;ll make the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:41.680" style="s2">better there&#39;s a there&#39;s a stoicism to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.390" end="00:18:43.390" style="s2">Peterson and as I then one of the person</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.680" end="00:18:44.680" style="s2">one of the people who watches me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.390" end="00:18:46.120" style="s2">of people who watch me then they go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.680" end="00:18:47.860" style="s2">his things and they ask him questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.120" end="00:18:50.380" style="s2">they ask him questions that I&#39;m playing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.860" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">with and they write me back and so one</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.380" end="00:18:55.570" style="s2">person at one of his at one of his book</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">tours got the question through that said</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.570" end="00:19:00.970" style="s2">okay what&#39;s at the top of the hill</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:03.010" style="s2">you&#39;re pulling the cross up and I&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.970" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">tired I would need too much time to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.010" end="00:19:09.850" style="s2">unpack that I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a Dodge</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:12.820" style="s2">I think Peterson is working as hard as</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.850" end="00:19:17.620" style="s2">he can to figure out what&#39;s at the top</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.820" end="00:19:20.440" style="s2">of the hill in Christianity none of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.620" end="00:19:22.360" style="s2">know that you know Paul says well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.440" end="00:19:25.060" style="s2">been to the third heaven and we have</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.060" end="00:19:31.330" style="s2">and they&#39;re all built into this rich</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:28.230" style="s2">understand it Christianity is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">that we need faith because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.230" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">there must be doubt and doubt must</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:38.490" style="s2">making himself vulnerable I have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.910" end="00:21:40.890" style="s2">of knowing that could I be wrong you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.490" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">know I could be wrong but you live with</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.890" end="00:21:47.490" style="s2">what you know you don&#39;t have any other</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:50.130" style="s2">choice so I was raised by great parents</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.490" end="00:21:52.110" style="s2">and I was I learned to love Jesus as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.130" end="00:21:54.570" style="s2">child and I&#39;ve seen no reason to give it</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.110" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">up now now if you ask me if I trust</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.570" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">Jesus more than I trust myself no way</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">I&#39;m a you know part of what&#39;s nice about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:03.180" style="s2">being a Calvinist as I can say I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">wretched sinner and I&#39;m a really lousy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.180" end="00:22:08.810" style="s2">Christian and you can still be a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.220" end="00:22:08.810" style="s2">and be that in the Calvinist Church</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.130" end="00:22:17.630" style="s2">yeah cuz after the service today I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.070" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">talking to some of the people who came</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.630" end="00:22:21.500" style="s2">and one guy I was talking to for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:24.650" style="s2">little while and then he said I you a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.500" end="00:22:27.410" style="s2">believer and I couldn&#39;t answer I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.650" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">know what he meant I was like I I just</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.410" end="00:22:32.180" style="s2">and he obviously wanted me to say yes or</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:36.070" style="s2">no and I didn&#39;t know like what that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.180" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">question means and I guess I came to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.070" end="00:22:41.210" style="s2">what did I say I think I said something</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:42.800" style="s2">like I&#39;ve got a deeper appreciation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.210" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">the Christian stories I&#39;ve got a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.800" end="00:22:45.830" style="s2">appreciation of the essential</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:49.010" style="s2">metaphorical rightness of a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.830" end="00:22:51.650" style="s2">and it became quite a long answer how</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.010" end="00:22:53.330" style="s2">should I answer that question this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.650" end="00:22:57.530" style="s2">part of the insularity</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.330" end="00:22:59.300" style="s2">of the Christian bubble because people</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.530" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">say Peterson is copping out by saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.300" end="00:23:02.690" style="s2">you know do you believe in God what do</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:04.730" style="s2">you mean by belief what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.690" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">God when Peterson says that I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.730" end="00:23:09.020" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s a hundred percent correct</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">when this guy asked you are you believer</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.020" end="00:23:15.170" style="s2">he&#39;s out he&#39;s doing code talk within a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:17.630" style="s2">little bubble you could have said yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.170" end="00:23:19.970" style="s2">and a whole bunch of things he would</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:21.500" style="s2">have imagined that I don&#39;t know you very</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.970" end="00:23:23.240" style="s2">well but probably aren&#39;t true for your</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.500" end="00:23:24.920" style="s2">life you don&#39;t go to church every week</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.240" end="00:23:27.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t tithe you there&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.920" end="00:23:30.710" style="s2">these practices built into you but to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.050" end="00:23:32.330" style="s2">say no well believer in what so as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">Christian pastor often when people</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.330" end="00:23:36.050" style="s2">engage in code talk I pause them and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:39.050" style="s2">can do this because I&#39;m a pastor and say</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.050" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">what do you mean by saved well then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.050" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">find out what they mean and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:44.570" style="s2">say okay and move it around a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:46.340" style="s2">see what you can do with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.570" end="00:23:48.200" style="s2">conversation so I think you answered</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.340" end="00:23:50.390" style="s2">very well actually he&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.200" end="00:23:52.610" style="s2">confused and went on with his life</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.390" end="00:23:54.290" style="s2">because he was he was looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.610" end="00:23:56.420" style="s2">secret handshake and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.290" end="00:23:57.980" style="s2">happens in Christian churches and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.420" end="00:23:59.570" style="s2">people listening to Jordan Peterson come</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.980" end="00:24:03.050" style="s2">into a Christian Church they get asked a</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:04.340" style="s2">question like that well right away now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.050" end="00:24:08.660" style="s2">know I don&#39;t belong I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.340" end="00:24:11.020" style="s2">handshake so that&#39;s a hard thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.660" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">a really interesting topic because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.020" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">guess how does the Christian Church</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.920" end="00:24:25.670" style="s2">absorb deal with and they capitalized</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.220" end="00:24:28.550" style="s2">but at least kind of Italy find a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.670" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">of making use of the kind of what seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.550" end="00:24:31.940" style="s2">to be a bit of an awakening going on of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">people who are watching these biblical</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.940" end="00:24:37.130" style="s2">stories and getting an awful lot from it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:40.160" style="s2">because at the moment isn&#39;t they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.130" end="00:24:43.280" style="s2">really receptive or able to receive how</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.160" end="00:24:47.570" style="s2">do they do it I don&#39;t know that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.280" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">will which is sad so well I started a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.570" end="00:24:53.390" style="s2">meet-up and in some ways that meetup for</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:55.070" style="s2">me is is it a church plant no cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.390" end="00:24:57.590" style="s2">not a church we don&#39;t have sacraments we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:25:00.410" style="s2">don&#39;t have all those things of Church is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.590" end="00:25:04.070" style="s2">a a church that&#39;s a really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.410" end="00:25:08.120" style="s2">question because look at what a look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">how a a started look at what people have</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.120" end="00:25:12.980" style="s2">to do to get into it I&#39;ve had people</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:16.430" style="s2">join this church because they&#39;re in naa</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.980" end="00:25:18.800" style="s2">25 years and they said I need something</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.430" end="00:25:22.850" style="s2">my higher power needs a better</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.800" end="00:25:26.810" style="s2">definition okay well let&#39;s keep let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.850" end="00:25:29.300" style="s2">keep talking so I it may be and this it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.810" end="00:25:31.700" style="s2">may be that there is a revival of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.300" end="00:25:34.010" style="s2">that happens in Jordan Peterson&#39;s wake</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.700" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">but this is the history of the church if</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:39.140" style="s2">you look at the church and see all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">tiny little sub movements or they all</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.140" end="00:25:45.020" style="s2">started because something happened that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:48.770" style="s2">put a twist on everything and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.020" end="00:25:50.330" style="s2">community came in look at Methodism this</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.770" end="00:25:52.790" style="s2">has happened again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.330" end="00:25:54.740" style="s2">in history will there be another little</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.790" end="00:25:57.830" style="s2">group of churches that&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.740" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">because Jordan Peterson brought a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.830" end="00:26:02.600" style="s2">new thing to people and it didn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:04.430" style="s2">into the regular Church and so here it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.600" end="00:26:09.740" style="s2">begins I don&#39;t know could happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.430" end="00:26:11.300" style="s2">Peterson ISM Peterson I am gonna get in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">trouble for that for saying what I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.300" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">said I know but I&#39;m old enough to not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:17.390" style="s2">care too much I was actually raised a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.440" style="s2">Methodist</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.390" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">my parents were Methodists which</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.440" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">probably only up until I was sort of 10</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:30.130" style="s2">that but so I don&#39;t know what it means</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.470" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">so much except except that it was more</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.130" end="00:26:35.720" style="s2">about trying to understand how Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">would have lived but it&#39;s more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.720" end="00:26:38.830" style="s2">what I understood of Methodism it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.220" end="00:26:41.980" style="s2">more about looking looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.830" end="00:26:45.460" style="s2">him him as a as a guide mm-hmm was that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.980" end="00:26:49.299" style="s2">that be right yeah almost every new</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.460" end="00:26:53.649" style="s2">church movement and heresy starts</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.299" end="00:26:56.289" style="s2">because a group of people say I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.649" end="00:26:58.179" style="s2">know the real Jesus and and you guys</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.289" end="00:26:59.289" style="s2">have lost your way right yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.179" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">then they start their own little thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.289" end="00:27:05.559" style="s2">and then that goes for religions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:07.240" style="s2">very long things goes for a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.559" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">years and then I regularly have</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.240" end="00:27:11.559" style="s2">Jehovah&#39;s Witness come to my door and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">I have enough time I&#39;ll sit them down</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.559" end="00:27:15.460" style="s2">and I&#39;ll start asking them questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:17.169" style="s2">about what they really believe and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.460" end="00:27:20.230" style="s2">they&#39;re heretics for the jobs witnesses</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.169" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">because other stuff is coming into them</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.230" end="00:27:26.860" style="s2">and that process is always happening so</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:29.049" style="s2">well I&#39;m not God and I&#39;m happy to not be</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.860" end="00:27:31.649" style="s2">him at the moment Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.049" end="00:27:34.120" style="s2">going into some debates for Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.649" end="00:27:37.570" style="s2">if you listen to the Vancouver ones I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.120" end="00:27:39.909" style="s2">have yeah what was your impression of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.570" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">the Vancouver debates I thought they</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.909" end="00:27:48.669" style="s2">were helpful in terms of I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:52.450" style="s2">optics of those debates are as important</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.669" end="00:27:55.029" style="s2">as the as the content of them I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.450" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">hear anything out of Peter almost his</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.029" end="00:27:59.889" style="s2">axioms were new and I wish he&#39;d put them</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:02.200" style="s2">on his website but most of what I heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.889" end="00:28:05.500" style="s2">out of Sam Harris you could hear on many</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.200" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">many of his podcasts but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.500" end="00:28:10.929" style="s2">these two individuals are sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:16.059" style="s2">talking engaging in a productive way</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.929" end="00:28:19.240" style="s2">that&#39;s to me that&#39;s a win and I that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.059" end="00:28:21.850" style="s2">what happens at our meetups this is what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.240" end="00:28:24.730" style="s2">I&#39;d love to see more as a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.850" end="00:28:27.370" style="s2">minister I long for the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.730" end="00:28:29.980" style="s2">sit down with people and just hear what</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.370" end="00:28:32.139" style="s2">they think and talk about it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.980" end="00:28:34.360" style="s2">not nearly enough of that happening in</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.139" end="00:28:36.700" style="s2">churches or outside of churches and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.360" end="00:28:39.460" style="s2">to watch that happen and that people pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.700" end="00:28:44.260" style="s2">to hear it that&#39;s I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.460" end="00:28:47.529" style="s2">terrific and do you think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.260" end="00:28:48.940" style="s2">any flexibility on either side o do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.529" end="00:28:51.580" style="s2">think sam Harris might kind of turn</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.940" end="00:28:52.710" style="s2">around and just and say actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.580" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">right there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.710" end="00:28:57.670" style="s2">truth has to be embedded in stories I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.810" end="00:29:00.010" style="s2">realized that this whole atheism</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.670" end="00:29:04.150" style="s2">rationality thing is is actually only a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.010" end="00:29:05.680" style="s2">partial truth and you&#39;re right there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.150" end="00:29:08.920" style="s2">too far up the hierarchy to let that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.680" end="00:29:12.220" style="s2">happen but what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.920" end="00:29:13.510" style="s2">why so some people come to my meetup and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.220" end="00:29:16.780" style="s2">they say I used to be right there with</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.510" end="00:29:19.390" style="s2">Sam Harris now I&#39;m not so sure why</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.780" end="00:29:21.820" style="s2">because our mental minions are in there</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.390" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">listening and our conscious self is only</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:26.680" style="s2">this little part of it and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.950" end="00:29:29.140" style="s2">used Jonathan heights the elephant is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.680" end="00:29:33.460" style="s2">making decisions the rider is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.140" end="00:29:35.800" style="s2">giving rationale so Harris&#39;s way up the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.460" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">hierarchy some high profile people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.800" end="00:29:41.050" style="s2">flipped both ways so is it possible he</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:43.180" style="s2">could in the future yeah is it likely no</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.050" end="00:29:45.310" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what the point is about</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.180" end="00:29:47.110" style="s2">the point is let&#39;s hear your argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.310" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">let&#39;s hear your argument what do I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.110" end="00:29:51.550" style="s2">of it so I started making videos because</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.270" end="00:29:54.310" style="s2">I&#39;m watching these conversations and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.550" end="00:29:56.680" style="s2">I want to butt in I want to have a part</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.310" end="00:29:58.180" style="s2">I want to be a part of it and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.680" end="00:30:00.520" style="s2">kind of let me be a part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.180" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.520" end="00:30:05.040" style="s2">since now I&#39;m having these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:08.200" style="s2">with dozens of people and it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.040" end="00:30:10.360" style="s2">well what&#39;s happened is Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.200" end="00:30:14.230" style="s2">getting incorporated I mean it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.360" end="00:30:16.930" style="s2">brain here why do I start studying</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.230" end="00:30:19.780" style="s2">people like Peterson it&#39;s to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.930" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">him and when he says things in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.780" end="00:30:24.250" style="s2">way I think play it&#39;s a lot better way</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:26.770" style="s2">to say it so what am I gonna do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.250" end="00:30:28.510" style="s2">gonna use it pastors are thieves we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.770" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">not just Liars we&#39;re thieves and when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.510" end="00:30:32.220" style="s2">hear something that works well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:35.380" style="s2">grab that I&#39;m gonna work that forever</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.220" end="00:30:37.660" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s whole says it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.380" end="00:30:39.670" style="s2">finally gets into my thick skull</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.660" end="00:30:42.160" style="s2">you know our values stack up in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.670" end="00:30:44.200" style="s2">hierarchies well in my Sunday School</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.160" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">class I said right now in our culture we</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.200" end="00:30:47.500" style="s2">have a confusion between love and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:49.960" style="s2">kindness love is higher in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.500" end="00:30:51.790" style="s2">than kindness as well it should be when</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.960" end="00:30:54.850" style="s2">kindness is at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.790" end="00:30:56.770" style="s2">that&#39;s the permissive parent who gives</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.850" end="00:30:58.990" style="s2">their kid whatever he wants the loving</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.770" end="00:30:59.530" style="s2">parent sometimes will say no to their</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.990" end="00:31:02.070" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.530" end="00:31:04.660" style="s2">so kindness is lower on the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.070" end="00:31:05.800" style="s2">the whole story of Jesus a number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.660" end="00:31:06.130" style="s2">years ago when I was studying the book</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.800" end="00:31:08.560" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.130" end="00:31:10.630" style="s2">Peter I realized the New Testament is</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.560" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">all about status and hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.630" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2">it&#39;s got this crazy story where Jesus on</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:18.930" style="s2">one hand says you&#39;re all equal and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:21.970" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s radically egalitarian and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.930" end="00:31:24.580" style="s2">then he says but I&#39;m at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.970" end="00:31:27.720" style="s2">hierarchy and Jesus is about to serve</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.580" end="00:31:29.560" style="s2">Jesus gathers his disciples together and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.720" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">everybody in their mind has this</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.560" end="00:31:34.660" style="s2">hierarchy and Jesus at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:38.170" style="s2">they&#39;re about to celebrate the the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.660" end="00:31:40.390" style="s2">Exodus dinner and Jesus stands up he</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.170" end="00:31:41.740" style="s2">takes off his clothes I told my Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.390" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">School class said imagine if I step up</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.740" end="00:31:47.290" style="s2">and take off my clothes here we&#39;d call</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.310" style="s2">nine-one-one stood up take off his you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.290" end="00:31:49.630" style="s2">know stripped down his underwear I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.310" end="00:31:51.910" style="s2">wrapped a towel around him and starts</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.630" end="00:31:53.350" style="s2">washing his disciples feet and his</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.910" end="00:31:56.260" style="s2">disciples they&#39;re all work in the house</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.350" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">no no no Jesus says if you don&#39;t let me</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.260" end="00:31:59.980" style="s2">wash your feet you can have no part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:03.340" style="s2">me Peter says well wash my whole body</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.980" end="00:32:04.150" style="s2">just like the feet are enough and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.340" end="00:32:05.260" style="s2">washes their feet</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.150" end="00:32:07.510" style="s2">what what&#39;s jesus doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.260" end="00:32:12.010" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s just he&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.510" end="00:32:14.020" style="s2">servant and almost every text has this</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.010" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">dynamic so the top becomes the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.020" end="00:32:18.190" style="s2">and because the top becomes the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">he&#39;s really at the top we have this in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.190" end="00:32:21.730" style="s2">our national conversation who is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:26.050" style="s2">president&#39;s supposed to be the servant</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.730" end="00:32:28.900" style="s2">of all and the president so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.050" end="00:32:31.420" style="s2">captain of the Titanic go down with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.900" end="00:32:34.420" style="s2">ship why make sure everyone else is off</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.420" end="00:32:37.210" style="s2">and then you and we all know this this</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.420" end="00:32:39.940" style="s2">is deep within us now you might ask well</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.210" end="00:32:40.540" style="s2">this is this only Christianity or listen</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.940" end="00:32:43.920" style="s2">to Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.540" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">well maybe it&#39;s even deeper still so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.920" end="00:32:50.650" style="s2">what does that mean the Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:52.900" style="s2">actually an outgrowth of of the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.650" end="00:32:55.150" style="s2">principles that&#39;s right which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.900" end="00:32:57.790" style="s2">what CS Lewis says in the line in which</p>
