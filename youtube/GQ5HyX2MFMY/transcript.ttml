<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:21.170" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.460" end="00:00:29.270" style="s2">and people thank you very much Peter for</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.170" end="00:00:30.800" style="s2">that handsome introduction so I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.270" end="00:00:32.949" style="s2">to invite people to just close their</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:32.949" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.019" end="00:00:52.760" style="s2">and I&#39;m aware of my heart rates elevated</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:01:02.510" style="s2">and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.050" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2">starts.this slightly slow down when</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.510" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">we&#39;re ever tingling in my hands I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.150" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">still aware of the heartbeat really</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:33.020" style="s2">there yeah and a desire to say the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:34.850" style="s2">thing to come across well I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.020" end="00:01:37.690" style="s2">feeling quite a lot of fear through my</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.850" end="00:01:39.710" style="s2">system over the last couple of days and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.690" end="00:01:42.800" style="s2">watching is that kind of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.710" end="00:01:45.490" style="s2">this space but as I&#39;m speaking it part</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.800" end="00:01:45.490" style="s2">of it fades away</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:08.979" style="s2">so the lights invite you to open your</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.970" end="00:02:10.270" style="s2">eyes and if they&#39;re know if anyone here</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.979" end="00:02:12.610" style="s2">if you know what I mean if you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.270" end="00:02:22.420" style="s2">sense for the coherence of the group</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.610" end="00:02:27.850" style="s2">space and just track when is the grip</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">more in coherence and when is it fall</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.850" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">out of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">and what I seem to have found in my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">journey with truth trauma not so much</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">technology is there are trauma for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">example that is causing the slight</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">performance anxiety in me the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">wanting to be good the way I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">holding myself that trauma stops us from</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">tapping into actual truth because trauma</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:10.460" style="s2">leads to a suppression or a dissociation</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">from our current predicament</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.460" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a fragmentation between thought and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">emotion and yeah I just wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:31.770" style="s2">this way to really kind of experiment</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">with bringing a certain level of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.770" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">into the space on one level because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">feel that it is actually the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">important part for us to start building</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">collective coherence</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:59.350" style="s2">so with that oh okay cool yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.900" end="00:04:04.360" style="s2">this is about a trauma trauma truth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.350" end="00:04:11.290" style="s2">technology the three T&#39;s and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.360" end="00:04:16.980" style="s2">that the first two are at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.290" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">what is going on or wrong in society I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.980" end="00:04:21.430" style="s2">want to speak about trauma I mean trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">on the level of the individual trauma on</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.430" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">the level of the collective and trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">intergeneric intergenerational two</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:33.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s my belief that and maybe many</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">of you share lots of these beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.290" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">the vast majority of negative or</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:41.670" style="s2">militant actions we see in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:44.790" style="s2">not the result of psychopathy much of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.670" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">them are most of them are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.790" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">consequence of unresolved developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:56.390" style="s2">and I think what Peter is done with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.200" end="00:04:58.670" style="s2">store this like invitation for us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.390" end="00:05:00.440" style="s2">bring yeah almost like girls know if</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.670" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">you&#39;d agree with us but it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.440" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">almost like trying out a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">being it&#39;s like a new way of practicing</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:09.920" style="s2">of doing things in and I strongly</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">strongly believe that a huge part of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.920" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to transcend our current</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:21.590" style="s2">predicament is how we allow trauma into</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:24.830" style="s2">our relational fields and realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.590" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">so much incoherence be it politically be</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.830" end="00:05:32.930" style="s2">it socially yet just enter subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">is a consequence of us not having the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.930" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">capacity to integrate thoughts feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">an emotion because of undigested trauma</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.710" end="00:05:48.680" style="s2">there&#39;s another piece that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.450" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">important too just so I&#39;m just putting a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.680" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">lot of little flags in the grounds here</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:55.730" style="s2">this individual trauma as the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:06:01.850" style="s2">many of our negative predicaments but</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.730" end="00:06:04.310" style="s2">there is also collective trauma and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.850" end="00:06:06.740" style="s2">could kind of go down a union pathway</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.310" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">here but I think it could be much more</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.740" end="00:06:12.740" style="s2">simple than that which is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:18.380" style="s2">have a predicament like the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.740" end="00:06:22.090" style="s2">the trauma of that time embeds and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.380" end="00:06:27.020" style="s2">manifests itself both biologically and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.090" end="00:06:29.090" style="s2">culturally and so the stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.020" end="00:06:32.510" style="s2">narratives that people tell post-war</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.090" end="00:06:36.350" style="s2">they kind of linger in the energetic</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.510" end="00:06:39.260" style="s2">cultural space and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.350" end="00:06:40.840" style="s2">intergenerational trauma which as Laura</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.260" end="00:06:44.060" style="s2">you know equal and sexual trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.840" end="00:06:49.610" style="s2">really the the epigenetic we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.060" end="00:06:53.540" style="s2">carrying the epigenetic residue of so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:55.640" style="s2">many of our ancestors and I think what a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.540" end="00:06:57.830" style="s2">lot of these could have met a modder and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.640" end="00:06:59.480" style="s2">sense making conversations lack is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.830" end="00:07:01.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a hell of a lot of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.480" end="00:07:03.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s all meta it&#39;s all sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.130" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">making and though people often</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.560" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">speak to embodiments they don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:13.370" style="s2">from embodiment and I can often also say</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">this in my own my own life right this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.370" end="00:07:16.900" style="s2">why I wanted to get a try a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:21.220" style="s2">more vulnerability than usual because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.900" end="00:07:23.660" style="s2">can track in myself when I&#39;m going meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.220" end="00:07:26.750" style="s2">because I should really be going meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:28.820" style="s2">visibly when I&#39;m going meta because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.750" end="00:07:32.480" style="s2">learned a behavioral pattern to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.820" end="00:07:34.669" style="s2">dissociate and I just want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.480" end="00:07:35.750" style="s2">and in the sense making community I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.669" end="00:07:36.979" style="s2">kind of like going in the warfighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.750" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">straight away but and this little sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.979" end="00:07:42.200" style="s2">making community will there is I deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">believe there is a lack of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.200" end="00:07:48.200" style="s2">speech and I put myself in that category</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:51.950" style="s2">of someone who struggles to them</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.200" end="00:07:55.130" style="s2">articulate from that place and again</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.950" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">like I said the consequence of that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.130" end="00:08:01.430" style="s2">consequence the result it is the symptom</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:05.720" style="s2">of trauma and the consequence of that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.430" end="00:08:10.460" style="s2">actually a lack of coherence in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.720" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">space I went to a sense-making party in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:13.370" style="s2">San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">she months ago because we cool kids do</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.370" end="00:08:18.050" style="s2">in the valley and they&#39;re almost talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.370" style="s2">the theme of the night was coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.050" end="00:08:21.140" style="s2">everyone was talking about coherence</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:23.419" style="s2">every single person was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.140" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">coherence but it was literally it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.419" end="00:08:29.320" style="s2">from the most abstract rational place</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.850" end="00:08:35.720" style="s2">the grip shifted when people started</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:37.940" style="s2">opening up from a more embodied place</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.720" end="00:08:39.260" style="s2">and you can feel that when that happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:44.590" style="s2">right can you guys like know it when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.260" end="00:08:44.590" style="s2">can like feel when like a group coheres</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.890" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">so anyway I wanted to start with that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.270" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">feel that the related development of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.130" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">trauma is the most under looked yet most</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">important aspect of us building</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">coherence building sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:08:59.060" style="s2">building collective intelligence moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:01.400" style="s2">forward and in order for us to do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.060" end="00:09:05.210" style="s2">we have to come into the discomfort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.400" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">being embodied hmm I had no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.210" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">you were gonna talk about today but like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.460" style="s2">I&#39;m pleasantly surprised because this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:13.970" style="s2">maps over to a lot of the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.460" end="00:09:16.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having personally with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.970" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">of people and at the stoah and and Raven</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.920" end="00:11:31.150" style="s2">things like that I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.140" end="00:11:31.150" style="s2">couple of things to say the first is I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.200" end="00:11:38.980" style="s2">believe that the the form of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:41.900" style="s2">that has to and is trying to emerge is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.980" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">the type of leader who is able to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.900" end="00:11:47.870" style="s2">back to those more blue-collar</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:52.280" style="s2">communities and actually try this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.870" end="00:11:54.080" style="s2">on and almost be like okay I may get</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.280" end="00:11:57.320" style="s2">ridiculed that may get shamed especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.080" end="00:11:59.800" style="s2">if you&#39;re a dude but it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.320" end="00:12:01.940" style="s2">happens if I am able to tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:04.300" style="s2">but I want to make a distinction I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.940" end="00:12:13.590" style="s2">lived in San Francisco for three years</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.300" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">with a fluffy bypass II like San Fran</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.590" end="00:12:16.620" style="s2">scene of like Lester share our feelings</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.529" end="00:12:22.650" style="s2">not what I&#39;m what I&#39;m advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.180" end="00:12:25.230" style="s2">here so I do believe there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.650" end="00:12:26.970" style="s2">synthesis between being embodied with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.230" end="00:12:30.930" style="s2">certain sense of bringing to romance a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.970" end="00:12:32.970" style="s2">relation without being am naive and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.930" end="00:12:34.950" style="s2">think on to the second point when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.970" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2">speak about naive I think my initial</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.950" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">attempts to start to articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.839" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">stuff was quite naive and to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:46.170" style="s2">may still be and this kind of links the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:49.620" style="s2">truth I believe trauma and truth are</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.170" end="00:12:51.510" style="s2">deeply interconnected I thought that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.620" end="00:12:53.100" style="s2">I were just to be able to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.510" end="00:12:55.320" style="s2">world me like telling the truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.100" end="00:12:58.650" style="s2">of my experience at all times people</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.320" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">would that would be like the cure but</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.020" end="00:15:40.200" style="s2">circling and restorative circles empty</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.740" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">circles they&#39;re really good I find in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.200" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">order to well how can you use the words</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:51.240" style="s2">artificial it&#39;s an interesting one maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:53.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like consciously manufactured maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.240" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a better phrase to put it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.460" end="00:15:55.950" style="s2">like it&#39;s like consciously designed</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:59.970" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a better way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.950" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">instead artificial because what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:05.400" style="s2">would suggest known is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;re currently doing in relation is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.400" end="00:16:10.620" style="s2">thing that&#39;s artificial yep the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">the complete suppression of what is true</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.620" end="00:16:17.790" style="s2">feels more artificial to me then these</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:20.730" style="s2">spaces where we um permission ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:24.570" style="s2">to speak more freely yeah yeah I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.730" end="00:16:26.070" style="s2">agree with that in spirit and and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.570" end="00:16:29.430" style="s2">these these kind of spaces that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.070" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">consciously designed I noticed like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:33.150" style="s2">is my sense of the two moves that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:35.250" style="s2">needed and I want to I want to see what</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.150" end="00:16:39.240" style="s2">you think there has to be like a minimal</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">viable sovereignty at play like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.240" end="00:16:41.520" style="s2">individuals involved need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.380" end="00:16:43.770" style="s2">individuated enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.520" end="00:16:45.720" style="s2">in order for this coherence or</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.770" end="00:16:48.570" style="s2">communitas to come online in a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:50.970" style="s2">felt sense way if if it&#39;s not if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.570" end="00:16:52.740" style="s2">there&#39;s more than one people that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.970" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">say are not psychologically developed</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.740" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">not away in the keygen level or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">you want to call it then the group</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:17:02.340" style="s2">collapses right yeah all it takes is one</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.140" end="00:17:03.630" style="s2">so is that your experience is that your</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.340" end="00:17:06.780" style="s2">sense of the correct movement as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.630" end="00:17:13.110" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that that seems right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.780" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">and so now like jumping to the wild you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.110" end="00:17:18.209" style="s2">know where you said the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:21.589" style="s2">are artificial and the way I interpret</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.209" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">that is that people adopt</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.589" end="00:17:27.390" style="s2">intersubjective games</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.339" end="00:17:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s our unconscious of yeah so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.390" end="00:17:29.850" style="s2">like they say if you&#39;re like with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.320" end="00:17:31.410" style="s2">disagreeable asshole and you disagrees</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.850" end="00:17:32.580" style="s2">with you and then like okay I gotta play</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.410" end="00:17:33.720" style="s2">with this game and then we&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.580" end="00:17:35.220" style="s2">gorilla comes in you start beating your</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.720" end="00:17:36.630" style="s2">chest but you know if you&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.220" end="00:17:38.520" style="s2">meta communication you can kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.630" end="00:17:40.050" style="s2">do some judo moves Aikido moves around</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.520" end="00:17:42.060" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to play that game if</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:44.460" style="s2">you&#39;re skilled to that area but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.060" end="00:17:46.410" style="s2">people adopt certain frames of inter</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:48.870" style="s2">social interactions that you know are</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.410" end="00:17:52.680" style="s2">not to service of themselves or to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.870" end="00:17:55.770" style="s2">others they&#39;re not in service but I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.680" end="00:17:57.690" style="s2">would I do I and I did believe that no</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.770" end="00:18:00.840" style="s2">matter what kind of adult behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.690" end="00:18:04.110" style="s2">game you see playing out it was one time</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.840" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">a very intelligent function at a much</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.110" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">younger age</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.210" style="s2">yeah and so this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:11.700" style="s2">development of trauma piece when you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.210" end="00:18:13.410" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of like guerrilla Varma like</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.700" end="00:18:15.330" style="s2">guy who&#39;s coming in and he&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.410" end="00:18:17.850" style="s2">a fight and a Friday night in a bar you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.330" end="00:18:19.470" style="s2">know he&#39;s he&#39;s really his six or seven</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.850" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">year old is looking for a fight after he</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.470" end="00:18:25.860" style="s2">was you know badly beaten or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:28.860" style="s2">along those lines so I think one</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.860" end="00:18:30.570" style="s2">important distinction to an important</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.860" end="00:18:31.680" style="s2">way to frame this and I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.570" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">naive with it because there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.680" end="00:18:35.010" style="s2">malevolence there is evil less less and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.410" style="s2">not pretend that that problem isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.010" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">there yeah but a lot of it is I believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.410" end="00:18:41.610" style="s2">that if we can do the development or</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:43.620" style="s2">drama work and integrate the six seven</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.610" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">eight euro part of ourselves so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.620" end="00:18:47.400" style="s2">that energy that is trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:52.380" style="s2">itself in the nervous system is able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.400" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">come to rest and we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.380" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">sistent Li compensate because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:18:59.880" style="s2">actually trying to avoid some of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.180" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">most primal emotions of sadness anger</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.880" end="00:19:08.790" style="s2">and fear and so uh just for the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.260" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">in the room like Josh and I can go all</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.790" end="00:19:11.790" style="s2">day about this type of stuff so if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:15.180" style="s2">have any questions throw them in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.790" end="00:19:17.220" style="s2">chat box and we&#39;ll take it in and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.180" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">your life work is pretty much this so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.220" end="00:19:21.300" style="s2">far or at least when you kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">that switch away from Finance and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.300" end="00:19:24.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a focus on technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:26.520" style="s2">so maybe key tell us about like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.930" end="00:19:34.530" style="s2">strategies that you&#39;re personally using</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.520" end="00:19:37.470" style="s2">or advocating for yeah as it pertains to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.530" end="00:19:42.770" style="s2">what what exact or addressing addressing</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.470" end="00:19:46.890" style="s2">trauma in an interpersonal context yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.770" end="00:19:48.630" style="s2">yeah so like I said I I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.890" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">from from my own experience that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.630" end="00:19:55.980" style="s2">pretty pretty it&#39;s pretty clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:57.570" style="s2">that being any persistent we space with</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.980" end="00:19:59.670" style="s2">the same group of people rep a long</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.570" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">period of time that has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.670" end="00:20:03.450" style="s2">transmission you can do the Luminess</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:11.630" style="s2">been the most powerful for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.440" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">there&#39;s also obviously the realms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:20.970" style="s2">psychedelics and contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:25.190" style="s2">I feel like contemplatively work on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.970" end="00:20:27.720" style="s2">trauma piece and I&#39;ll explain why I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.190" end="00:20:29.430" style="s2">thought that in order to transcend some</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:31.680" style="s2">of these most deeply held issues it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.430" end="00:20:33.210" style="s2">these were just expressions of a</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.840" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">all trauma as fundamentally relational</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.390" end="00:20:50.580" style="s2">and so trauma has to be healed in</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.800" end="00:22:12.060" style="s2">they&#39;re contracted we can theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:14.340" style="s2">begin to build tools that could help</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.060" end="00:22:17.970" style="s2">people titrate some of that trauma out</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.340" end="00:22:19.920" style="s2">of their system so for example we I</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:23.370" style="s2">believe that the consciousness hacking</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.920" end="00:22:26.040" style="s2">space will soon be able to real to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.370" end="00:22:27.720" style="s2">realize tools that for example if</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.040" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">someone is holding a trauma contraction</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.720" end="00:22:31.320" style="s2">in their belly and that contractions and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:33.150" style="s2">intelligent function because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.320" end="00:22:35.550" style="s2">stopping an overwhelming sensation that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.150" end="00:22:38.250" style="s2">was previously suppressed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.550" end="00:22:39.990" style="s2">people can access those areas right when</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.250" end="00:22:40.530" style="s2">you say what do you feel you don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.990" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.530" end="00:22:44.810" style="s2">it can take people a long long time to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.510" end="00:22:47.430" style="s2">get in touch with those core wounds I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.810" end="00:22:50.160" style="s2">think that science and technology is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.430" end="00:22:52.170" style="s2">gonna be able to help us in the distant</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.160" end="00:22:55.920" style="s2">future I don&#39;t know how long 10 15 20</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.170" end="00:22:57.510" style="s2">years to begin to come into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.920" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">those contractions that begin to release</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.510" end="00:23:01.710" style="s2">some of those deeply held emotions so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not using even though I&#39;m working in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.710" end="00:23:04.860" style="s2">the tech scene I&#39;m I was working in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.390" end="00:23:06.210" style="s2">tech scene I&#39;m not using that from my</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.860" end="00:23:11.160" style="s2">own trauma journey but I think it has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.210" end="00:23:13.980" style="s2">ton of potential moving forward yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.160" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">much so much to go down there and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.980" end="00:23:17.730" style="s2">I kinda want to inquire too about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:19.470" style="s2">sure you&#39;re familiar with Ken Wilbur&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.730" end="00:23:21.150" style="s2">integral life practice framework and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.470" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">then genre viki&#39;s ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.150" end="00:23:25.290" style="s2">how we have to have a wise balance there</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:26.610" style="s2">and I&#39;m actually adjunct researcher at</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.290" end="00:23:29.010" style="s2">Jon&#39;s consciousness of wisdom studies</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.610" end="00:23:31.350" style="s2">lab and the whole idea is to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.010" end="00:23:32.580" style="s2">bring a wisdom Jim forth that has an</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.350" end="00:23:34.260" style="s2">ecology of practices that can address</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.580" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">all these areas so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.260" end="00:23:40.169" style="s2">spiritual psychedelic Gnosticism doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.549" style="s2">come online so I&#39;m wondering even any</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.169" end="00:23:43.290" style="s2">thoughts about the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.549" end="00:23:45.330" style="s2">ecology practices and then I&#39;ll turn to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.290" end="00:23:47.549" style="s2">the questions in the chat box well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.330" end="00:23:49.980" style="s2">actually not from I&#39;m not I knew I cared</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.549" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">where Becky see that as a theme I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.980" end="00:23:55.350" style="s2">know the precise specifics it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">you have a meditative spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.350" end="00:23:58.710" style="s2">but also you do shadow work Trammell</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:23:59.970" style="s2">work then you do like weight lifting you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.710" end="00:24:01.290" style="s2">know you then you do like journal</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.970" end="00:24:02.910" style="s2">writing whatever so you have an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.290" end="00:24:04.980" style="s2">that kind of a mixture of sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.910" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">individual that Prime&#39;s you for</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.980" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2">communitas yes so the way I look at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:14.070" style="s2">as Ken Weber&#39;s wake up grow up clean up</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:15.540" style="s2">sure yeah I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll just give</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.070" end="00:24:18.630" style="s2">it a brief overview in case people</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.540" end="00:24:20.130" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard of it Ken Wilber says</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.630" end="00:24:21.929" style="s2">there are four stages to consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.130" end="00:24:25.290" style="s2">evolution the first stage is waking up</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.929" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">I&#39;m what waking up is it is the movement</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.290" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">from the gross and separate perception</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:31.770" style="s2">of reality it&#39;s a more of an</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">interdependent unit of subtle</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.770" end="00:24:39.390" style="s2">consciousness and if you are in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">of psychedelic or the tech circles how</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.390" end="00:24:43.740" style="s2">you might perceive spiritual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:45.270" style="s2">is focused on the waking up component of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.740" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">consciousness evolution it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.270" end="00:24:49.559" style="s2">getting non-jew getting there quick</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">transcending suffering there you go and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.559" end="00:24:53.010" style="s2">I see a lot of that in Silicon Valley by</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:54.570" style="s2">the way like that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.010" end="00:24:57.150" style="s2">problem with building these tools like</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a real problem now it&#39;s the waking</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.150" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">up but there&#39;s also growing up so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:02.850" style="s2">growing up refers to the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:05.190" style="s2">development stages so you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.850" end="00:25:08.220" style="s2">Keegan before you go so go spiral</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.190" end="00:25:09.929" style="s2">dynamics so 70% of the world are ethno</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.220" end="00:25:11.070" style="s2">ego or ethnocentric stages of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.929" end="00:25:13.860" style="s2">development according to a total</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.070" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">development theory that means that 70%</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.860" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">of the world are most concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:23.280" style="s2">themselves and/or their kin tribe</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:24.630" style="s2">religion community and what are well</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.280" end="00:25:25.750" style="s2">known theory suggests is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.630" end="00:25:28.690" style="s2">stages above this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.750" end="00:25:31.330" style="s2">one is able to include more complexity</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.690" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">in more perspectives so green to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.330" end="00:25:36.340" style="s2">whatever you want to call it and so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">I think is also really important to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.340" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">how are we moving along that vertical</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.750" end="00:25:44.500" style="s2">trajectory and every wants to be higher</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:46.690" style="s2">and stuff right and then there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.500" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">sorry Pete just to finish off and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.690" end="00:25:49.810" style="s2">this cleaning up which is healing trauma</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:51.220" style="s2">and doing shadow work and then showing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.810" end="00:25:52.870" style="s2">up which is how are you actually showing</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.220" end="00:25:54.760" style="s2">up in the world I was listening to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.870" end="00:25:58.230" style="s2">podcast by a Dan Brown today and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:26:02.170" style="s2">whole thing it was like the fruits is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.230" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like the fruits of awakening are</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.170" end="00:26:05.710" style="s2">seen in their action something along</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">with that like if you&#39;re having an</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.710" end="00:26:09.910" style="s2">interior experience of non-duality but</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:12.090" style="s2">it isn&#39;t manifesting itself and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.910" end="00:26:18.070" style="s2">benevolent behavior you haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.090" end="00:26:19.810" style="s2">moved up the path of awakened alright so</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.070" end="00:26:20.470" style="s2">uh let&#39;s go to the questions for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.810" end="00:26:24.220" style="s2">next thirty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.470" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">rain could you ask your question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.220" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">thanks I was just wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:34.660" style="s2">articulate more precisely what that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">relationship is between truth and drama</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.660" end="00:26:40.360" style="s2">I got there&#39;s a part you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:42.280" style="s2">something about letting your truth come</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.360" end="00:26:44.650" style="s2">out or trauma getting in the way of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.280" end="00:27:00.810" style="s2">we just love to hear more about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.650" end="00:27:00.810" style="s2">relationship between those two yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:08.259" style="s2">leave trauma does to our nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.809" end="00:27:13.210" style="s2">as it leads to a fragmentation between</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.259" end="00:27:15.090" style="s2">thoughts emotion and sensation so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.210" end="00:27:18.129" style="s2">might be telling you hey I&#39;m scared</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.090" end="00:27:20.740" style="s2">right and I&#39;m cognitively telling you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.129" end="00:27:22.990" style="s2">I&#39;m scared but if I&#39;m not actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.740" end="00:27:24.669" style="s2">feeling my fear or feeling the physical</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.990" end="00:27:27.700" style="s2">sensation of the heart beating in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.669" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">chest I&#39;m not actually in truth with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.700" end="00:27:32.409" style="s2">or I&#39;m not actually being fully truthful</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">with you I&#39;m being truthful from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.409" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">perspective of fragmentation and so when</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.860" end="00:27:40.539" style="s2">we speak about like the word integrity</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:43.029" style="s2">like integrity is us being able to speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.539" end="00:27:45.730" style="s2">from what is true cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.029" end="00:27:48.850" style="s2">emotionally and somatically at the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.730" end="00:27:50.919" style="s2">time and I think that what trauma does</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">is because it fragments our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.919" end="00:27:55.090" style="s2">system it bilko&#39;s us into the head maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">a lot of us that&#39;s our pattern my</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.090" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">pattern is to go into my head we lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:03.869" style="s2">touch with emotional and physical truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:11.889" style="s2">and I think that is what creates</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.869" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">incoherence in our relational fields so</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.889" end="00:28:22.919" style="s2">I hear in that that you value congruence</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:25.210" style="s2">and truth like being able to speak be</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.919" end="00:28:27.369" style="s2">embodied enough that you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.210" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">your truth when you&#39;re interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.369" end="00:28:34.649" style="s2">others yeah and to reframe if you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:40.149" style="s2">not embodied enough you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.649" end="00:28:42.610" style="s2">transmitting what is deeply truthful it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.149" end="00:28:48.940" style="s2">is important to transmit what&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.610" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">truthful in order to build deep and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.940" end="00:28:54.639" style="s2">is my experience that when I am able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:58.539" style="s2">touch into those three layers of truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.639" end="00:29:03.129" style="s2">in their line something seems to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.539" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">in my relations like a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.129" end="00:29:09.789" style="s2">coherence called even and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:12.909" style="s2">interesting like even if you feel into</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.789" end="00:29:15.700" style="s2">this group field right watch when our</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.909" end="00:29:18.519" style="s2">attention goes away</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.700" end="00:29:21.149" style="s2">and watch when it comes back like as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.519" end="00:29:25.720" style="s2">group and we can kind of sense that and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.149" end="00:29:28.779" style="s2">I noticed that if we move into more</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.720" end="00:29:40.389" style="s2">heady less embodied speech coherence</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.779" end="00:29:45.880" style="s2">tends to diminish yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.389" end="00:29:50.039" style="s2">raven and you had a question hi thanks</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.880" end="00:29:54.070" style="s2">Joshua for being here Weston was about</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.039" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">simply I&#39;ve I&#39;ve seen in in my world</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.070" end="00:29:58.289" style="s2">like a lot of communities that were</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:30:01.000" style="s2">centered around trauma practices and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.289" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">sometimes they seem to kind of go off</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.000" end="00:30:07.299" style="s2">the rails a little bit into this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">narcissistic cycle of everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.299" end="00:30:12.760" style="s2">becoming trauma everything like becoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:15.130" style="s2">about the process of dealing with trauma</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.760" end="00:30:17.470" style="s2">and so I guess in some way like an over</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.130" end="00:30:20.019" style="s2">application of that as a sense making</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.470" end="00:30:22.269" style="s2">tool but then there also seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.019" end="00:30:25.149" style="s2">part of this that is when a group comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.269" end="00:30:28.149" style="s2">together and like practitioners are</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.149" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">trauma oriented and that&#39;s what they do</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.149" end="00:30:34.149" style="s2">they kind of have an incentive to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:36.519" style="s2">trauma in places where maybe it may not</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.149" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">be the best thing best level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.519" end="00:30:42.760" style="s2">engagement and I see that as being a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">possible pitfall of communities coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.760" end="00:30:47.860" style="s2">around coming together for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.220" style="s2">of dealing with trauma that it may</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.860" end="00:30:52.659" style="s2">become an overly applied tool what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.220" end="00:30:57.669" style="s2">you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.659" end="00:30:59.289" style="s2">yeah yeah almost like it becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.669" end="00:31:01.299" style="s2">wind since where you see everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.289" end="00:31:03.850" style="s2">through the trauma lens right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.299" end="00:31:07.510" style="s2">hammer yeah I get that and I also get</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.850" end="00:31:10.179" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of em not all negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.510" end="00:31:11.620" style="s2">lips should be entertained like some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.179" end="00:31:12.909" style="s2">them are negative loops because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.620" end="00:31:17.049" style="s2">negative lips not because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.909" end="00:31:19.570" style="s2">undigested emotion so yeah I really I</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.049" end="00:31:21.700" style="s2">really hear you know I don&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:24.850" style="s2">did you know Roger wall she&#39;s a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:27.159" style="s2">teacher one of the kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.850" end="00:31:29.110" style="s2">like classic like fixham spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.159" end="00:31:30.910" style="s2">and he&#39;s just like far</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.110" end="00:31:31.990" style="s2">this drama stuff he&#39;s like it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.910" end="00:31:33.610" style="s2">well being and you don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.990" end="00:31:36.309" style="s2">to digest drama to cultivate positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.610" end="00:31:41.350" style="s2">night I think why I&#39;m emphasizing it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.309" end="00:31:44.020" style="s2">here is because there&#39;s so much there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.350" end="00:31:45.820" style="s2">and Peter speaks to this like the lemon</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.020" end="00:31:47.620" style="s2">of war the culture war there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.820" end="00:31:50.710" style="s2">fragmentation and our information</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:53.620" style="s2">ecology like we&#39;re needing something to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.710" end="00:31:56.679" style="s2">actually bring us back into coherence</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.620" end="00:32:00.250" style="s2">and I think that we&#39;re trying to come</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.679" end="00:32:03.309" style="s2">back into coherence through reason but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.250" end="00:32:05.350" style="s2">you know the plan Demick youtube film</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.309" end="00:32:06.910" style="s2">got halfway across the world before</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.350" end="00:32:09.730" style="s2">anyone could even argue against it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.910" end="00:32:12.630" style="s2">rationally so I think it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.730" end="00:32:15.970" style="s2">missing component of the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.630" end="00:32:18.250" style="s2">conversation but it isn&#39;t the fuel</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:23.169" style="s2">component and I totally agree that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.250" end="00:32:25.090" style="s2">can get lost in it thank you cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.169" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">actually finally wash that plane Deming</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.090" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">from last night I fell asleep halfway</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:33.100" style="s2">through so it&#39;s pretty good pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:35.110" style="s2">too much a bit Maslow&#39;s hammer comes to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.100" end="00:32:37.419" style="s2">mind you know like if you if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.110" end="00:32:38.950" style="s2">hammer everything&#39;s a nail and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.419" end="00:32:40.990" style="s2">have some kind of epistemic Authority in</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.950" end="00:32:42.130" style="s2">one domain sometimes it bleeds over to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.990" end="00:32:45.040" style="s2">other domains and you act like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.130" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">authority we really shouldn&#39;t and I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.040" end="00:32:48.010" style="s2">writing the chat box it&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.630" style="s2">difference between an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.010" end="00:32:52.450" style="s2">hierarchy versus a conscious hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.630" end="00:32:54.130" style="s2">and when you can kind of have that meta</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.450" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">communicative abilities where you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.130" end="00:32:58.450" style="s2">play with it not only the content but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.500" end="00:32:59.830" style="s2">with the agenda then you can say okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.450" end="00:33:01.450" style="s2">right now we&#39;re listening to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.830" end="00:33:03.580" style="s2">has legitimate expertise in this area</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.450" end="00:33:05.710" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to defer to them during</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.580" end="00:33:07.059" style="s2">this context during this moment it if</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.710" end="00:33:09.250" style="s2">done right I don&#39;t say think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.059" end="00:33:10.510" style="s2">anything unhealthy about that it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.250" end="00:33:11.740" style="s2">when that becomes unconscious and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.510" end="00:33:12.309" style="s2">carries over to different domains when</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.740" end="00:33:14.280" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.309" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">that&#39;s when I think it gets pathological</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.280" end="00:33:19.770" style="s2">so I&#39;m curiously it was with what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:19.770" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.340" end="00:33:26.580" style="s2">yeah I think part of the old version is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.990" end="00:33:26.580" style="s2">that kind of is a kind of like fit</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.820" end="00:33:32.360" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know when I speak a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.779" end="00:33:34.789" style="s2">masculine feminine or masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.360" end="00:33:36.440" style="s2">energy like I don&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.789" end="00:33:38.210" style="s2">them ontological II like there are these</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.440" end="00:33:40.759" style="s2">real things that are operating those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.210" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">principles but I but I kind of do and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.759" end="00:33:44.299" style="s2">think the whole notion of like the rise</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:46.190" style="s2">of the feminine we&#39;ve all heard that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.299" end="00:33:48.230" style="s2">right like we need the feminine I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.190" end="00:33:50.570" style="s2">part of that is is a quality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.230" end="00:33:55.850" style="s2">leadership that doesn&#39;t try to impose</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.570" end="00:33:57.710" style="s2">and really the quality of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.850" end="00:34:00.019" style="s2">that tries to impose like the Pharaohs</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.710" end="00:34:06.679" style="s2">all the way to CEOs all the way to mr.</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.019" end="00:34:09.290" style="s2">Trump I just think that is not it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.679" end="00:34:11.750" style="s2">longer appropriate for our current</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.290" end="00:34:15.950" style="s2">predicament which is so emergent so</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.750" end="00:34:19.639" style="s2">uncertain so fragile so adaptive that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.950" end="00:34:27.379" style="s2">we try to kind of do that thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.639" end="00:34:30.379" style="s2">gonna work so so I think if these like</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.379" end="00:34:33.649" style="s2">hierarchies do get epistemic hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.379" end="00:34:35.300" style="s2">emerge but from this emergent place</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.649" end="00:34:36.530" style="s2">rather than this idea what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.300" end="00:34:40.119" style="s2">tell everyone else what to do I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.530" end="00:34:40.119" style="s2">that is different I really do</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.379" end="00:34:48.829" style="s2">look you have a question yeah I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:52.819" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.829" end="00:34:54.409" style="s2">and then I also have like offering to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.819" end="00:34:57.619" style="s2">all of this that I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.409" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">interesting if you&#39;re up for it so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.619" end="00:35:04.130" style="s2">question is I don&#39;t know if people here</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:07.910" style="s2">are familiar with the work of Iain</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.130" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">McGilchrist and the whole idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.910" end="00:35:12.680" style="s2">know kind of the over reductionist world</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:16.310" style="s2">that we live in because of the imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.680" end="00:35:21.020" style="s2">into the like cortical structures of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.310" end="00:35:23.390" style="s2">last hemisphere of the brain and that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:27.730" style="s2">not there&#39;s like an 11-minute RSA video</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.390" end="00:35:30.530" style="s2">that speeds through a 650 page book um</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.730" end="00:35:33.500" style="s2">that to me in these conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.530" end="00:35:37.069" style="s2">trauma what can be really complicated is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.500" end="00:35:40.310" style="s2">like semantically we can start to talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.069" end="00:35:42.230" style="s2">about concepts and constructs that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.310" end="00:35:45.740" style="s2">because we may not have an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.230" end="00:35:47.810" style="s2">of the complexity of them we&#39;ll overly</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.740" end="00:35:51.560" style="s2">reduce them into like oh that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.810" end="00:35:54.260" style="s2">that&#39;s this thing and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.560" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">you know how to reconcile that and keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.260" end="00:35:59.270" style="s2">you know on the other side of that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">idea there is lots of trauma that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.270" end="00:36:08.930" style="s2">trauma operates neurobiologically below</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:10.820" style="s2">the order of language and so now that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.930" end="00:36:13.130" style="s2">use language kind of and try to top-down</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.820" end="00:36:15.320" style="s2">into an understanding of it from</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.130" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">language how do we reconcile that with</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.320" end="00:36:20.630" style="s2">the bottom of the body intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.310" end="00:36:27.890" style="s2">like we never will be able to put words</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.630" end="00:36:29.660" style="s2">- yeah yeah I&#39;ve read McGilchrist and</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.660" end="00:36:37.670" style="s2">like him well one thing one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.810" end="00:36:39.620" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily agree with Luke is</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.670" end="00:36:40.910" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to penetrate trauma</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.620" end="00:36:45.170" style="s2">through language</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.910" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">I think languages he shared it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.170" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">shared communication tool for people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:49.970" style="s2">like us in these relationships we</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite mastered the arc tool</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.970" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">apathy yet but in my own experience like</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:36:58.700" style="s2">the integration of trauma in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2">digestion of trauma is completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.700" end="00:37:07.010" style="s2">nonverbal it is actually the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:09.320" style="s2">bring undigested sensation into presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.010" end="00:37:12.380" style="s2">and this is where we lean a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.320" end="00:37:15.260" style="s2">more esoterically that bringing it into</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.380" end="00:37:16.940" style="s2">presence dissolves it and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.260" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">actually think we&#39;re I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.940" end="00:37:24.830" style="s2">think we&#39;re trying to get there through</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">language no I appreciate that and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.830" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">like for me the yeah the concern in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:33.590" style="s2">space that I have just in its this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">more to like the SF burner crowd than to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.590" end="00:37:40.280" style="s2">learn our group here but is the like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">there are people who will try to do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.280" end="00:37:44.450" style="s2">and that there&#39;s this like like what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:46.580" style="s2">mentioned at the beginning kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:50.600" style="s2">that sense making space but like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.580" end="00:37:54.290" style="s2">lack of coherence to embodied expression</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.600" end="00:37:56.060" style="s2">and that that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.290" end="00:37:58.460" style="s2">yeah for me I&#39;ve had lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.060" end="00:38:01.610" style="s2">conversations similarly or it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.460" end="00:38:05.840" style="s2">can rationalize on this very well this</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.610" end="00:38:07.910" style="s2">is not a rational process and just if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.840" end="00:38:11.570" style="s2">may so like I&#39;ve been reading a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.910" end="00:38:12.830" style="s2">Campbell recently the power of meth I</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.570" end="00:38:17.240" style="s2">kind of see it is that the power of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.830" end="00:38:19.340" style="s2">minutes yeah and there&#39;s a great he</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.240" end="00:38:21.530" style="s2">talks about metaphor and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.340" end="00:38:23.600" style="s2">like the internal experience which to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.530" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">kind of trauma as a stagnation and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.600" end="00:38:29.810" style="s2">fraction of internal experience and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:32.600" style="s2">talks about how right just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.810" end="00:38:35.180" style="s2">like the comment of the commonality of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.600" end="00:38:36.830" style="s2">these myths and is like it&#39;s utterly</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.180" end="00:38:38.840" style="s2">fascinating because they are speaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.830" end="00:38:42.110" style="s2">about the deep mystery of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.840" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">and everything else it is a mysterium a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.110" end="00:38:47.990" style="s2">mystery tremendum at Fosse nods</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:51.050" style="s2">tremendous horrific because it smashes</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.990" end="00:38:53.090" style="s2">all your fixed notions of things and at</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:55.010" style="s2">the same time utterly fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.090" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">because it&#39;s of your own nature and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.010" end="00:38:59.510" style="s2">being when you start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:39:02.840" style="s2">these things about the inner mystery</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.510" end="00:39:05.810" style="s2">inner life the eternal life there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.840" end="00:39:07.880" style="s2">too many images for you to loot use you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.810" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">begin on your own to have the images</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.880" end="00:39:13.220" style="s2">that are already present in some other</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">system of thought so I just thought that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.220" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">was really relevant to our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:21.530" style="s2">today over the like we may use somebody</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:27.380" style="s2">else&#39;s system to try and get at what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.530" end="00:39:29.960" style="s2">actually ours to reconcile with thanks</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.380" end="00:39:31.430" style="s2">like I know so just to flag that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.960" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">only book that I&#39;ve ever read back to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.430" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">cover and then started again on page one</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:47.510" style="s2">even i synchronistic choice cool so Mary</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:48.710" style="s2">you had a question is that me Mary yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.510" end="00:39:52.130" style="s2">Mary I believe you had a question oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.710" end="00:39:56.750" style="s2">okay I think Ravens question addressed</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.130" end="00:40:00.350" style="s2">it but I would say hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.750" end="00:40:03.350" style="s2">description of the we space it it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.350" end="00:40:08.069" style="s2">like we&#39;re sort of arbitrating between</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.350" end="00:40:11.819" style="s2">cerebral robots and traumatized children</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.069" end="00:40:16.529" style="s2">and trying to create safe space for it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.819" end="00:40:18.869" style="s2">and in my I don&#39;t know and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.529" end="00:40:21.869" style="s2">seeing we need in the world in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.869" end="00:40:28.680" style="s2">embracing future is getting comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.869" end="00:40:30.989" style="s2">with uncertainty and that requires not</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.680" end="00:40:35.219" style="s2">safety and kind of letting go of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.989" end="00:40:37.259" style="s2">rail and embracing what&#39;s coming and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.219" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">that maybe there&#39;s something different</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.259" end="00:40:42.809" style="s2">with what&#39;s emerging that can create</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:45.959" style="s2">coherence and truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.809" end="00:40:55.049" style="s2">looking forward if we let go of all</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.959" end="00:40:59.400" style="s2">those rails that&#39;s a thought do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.049" end="00:41:02.130" style="s2">think though that the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.400" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">uncertainties and adults is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.130" end="00:41:15.299" style="s2">echo of the fear of the child it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:18.869" style="s2">be I also think sort of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.299" end="00:41:25.130" style="s2">biology we are pattern seekers and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.869" end="00:41:30.199" style="s2">the comfort of existing patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.130" end="00:41:38.279" style="s2">that could also be causing the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.199" end="00:41:41.849" style="s2">discomfort with the new and yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.279" end="00:41:43.380" style="s2">thing with this mirror is it&#39;s not as if</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.849" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">this is this is a magic bullet right</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.380" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">like if we just saw for this like we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">suddenly would be you know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:51.630" style="s2">have to come across like fearful in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:42:00.539" style="s2">certain situations from my own</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.630" end="00:42:03.180" style="s2">experience with this as the digestion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.539" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">emotion that&#39;s such a deep layer from</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.180" end="00:42:09.539" style="s2">such an early age increases our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">systems capacity to hold more intense</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.539" end="00:42:14.759" style="s2">emotions that might come in as an adult</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:16.619" style="s2">it&#39;s more like we&#39;re creating where we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.759" end="00:42:18.470" style="s2">have a cup here and rather the cup being</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.619" end="00:42:21.380" style="s2">this size the trauma work in Laura</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.470" end="00:42:24.710" style="s2">is the cop so you get this cup and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.380" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">then your vessel is a better conduit or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.710" end="00:42:29.990" style="s2">the transmission of a of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:32.150" style="s2">emotion or energy and so that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.990" end="00:42:34.490" style="s2">think that how trauma is playing out is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.150" end="00:42:36.880" style="s2">because we don&#39;t our nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.490" end="00:42:40.010" style="s2">haven&#39;t cultivated that capacity to hold</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">the fear that inevitably comes from</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.010" end="00:42:48.849" style="s2">uncertainty in novelty totally agree I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:51.170" style="s2">guess it probably comes down to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.849" end="00:42:53.450" style="s2">responsibility were the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.170" end="00:42:56.260" style="s2">lies and I could see like creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.450" end="00:43:02.150" style="s2">spaces to have and see and explore how</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.260" end="00:43:08.420" style="s2">the color div could address that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.150" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">I&#39;d also like to see spaces that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.420" end="00:43:17.540" style="s2">manage that in a different way maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:26.180" style="s2">that&#39;s my own trauma trying to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.540" end="00:43:30.980" style="s2">pain of dealing with tricky little</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.180" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">bugger thank you thank you for this talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.980" end="00:43:38.180" style="s2">- it&#39;s been great so we&#39;re approaching</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:43.400" style="s2">the art time a lot of times let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.180" end="00:43:54.589" style="s2">one more question many you had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.400" end="00:43:57.710" style="s2">question going through this process for</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.589" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">the last two years of retraining myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.710" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">to feel the things our clock because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.720" end="00:44:03.710" style="s2">trauma so a lot of this is resonating</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">because I&#39;ve just lived it and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.710" end="00:44:10.070" style="s2">wondering because I am trying to look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:11.990" style="s2">games and things that help but what do</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.070" end="00:44:16.820" style="s2">you think in general to the group but</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.990" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">also to Joshua is I feel like we need we</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.820" end="00:44:23.089" style="s2">need a way to integrate some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:25.700" style="s2">trauma processing education at different</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.089" end="00:44:28.060" style="s2">stages for people in general like what</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:31.350" style="s2">do you think of that aspect I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.060" end="00:44:34.830" style="s2">the potential of scaling what it means</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.350" end="00:44:37.380" style="s2">to help people navigate trauma in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.830" end="00:44:40.080" style="s2">way that we use you know history and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.380" end="00:44:46.020" style="s2">geography as an education in systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.080" end="00:44:47.370" style="s2">what do you think of that yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.020" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the very question they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.370" end="00:44:50.700" style="s2">into the consciousness hacking space</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:52.890" style="s2">which is okay how do you scale higher</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.700" end="00:44:54.390" style="s2">consciousness and then when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.890" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">the word scale well what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.390" end="00:44:57.660" style="s2">about you think about technology low and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:44:59.910" style="s2">behold people are thinking about scaling</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.660" end="00:45:02.790" style="s2">consciousness higher states and stages</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.910" end="00:45:04.860" style="s2">of consciousness through technology so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.790" end="00:45:08.010" style="s2">think I think there&#39;s a couple of things</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">take any more time but yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.650" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">we do need a new language or in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:22.700" style="s2">actually mmm bitter can I just say a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:24.950" style="s2">couple of things just to please I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.700" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">the intention here was just to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.950" end="00:47:29.840" style="s2">little bit more the Arapahoe became</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">about trauma which is super but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.840" end="00:47:33.020" style="s2">there was also this thing around truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:35.270" style="s2">and truthfulness and Jacob I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.020" end="00:47:37.550" style="s2">coach mark timber as Jacobs here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.270" end="00:47:39.410" style="s2">gonna coach Maxim burger just to tease</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.550" end="00:47:40.700" style="s2">you and he makes this important</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.410" end="00:47:42.440" style="s2">distinction being truthful truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.700" end="00:47:43.609" style="s2">and so let us not deny that if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.440" end="00:47:44.780" style="s2">speaking truthfully it does not</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.609" end="00:47:51.800" style="s2">necessarily mean we&#39;re speaking the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.780" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">tryst but um I think we&#39;re in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.800" end="00:47:55.460" style="s2">making space together right and part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:57.590" style="s2">my intention for coming in here is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.460" end="00:48:00.619" style="s2">where do I see the highest input</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.590" end="00:48:03.080" style="s2">the highest output for the minimal</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.619" end="00:48:06.290" style="s2">inputs and I think it&#39;s two points it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.080" end="00:48:08.359" style="s2">developing trauma healing trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.290" end="00:48:10.910" style="s2">actually speaking truthfully in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.359" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">relationships and if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.910" end="00:48:16.790" style="s2">mass of our information ecology and all</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:18.380" style="s2">of this this the met all these competing</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.790" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">claims and narratives and illumina wars</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.380" end="00:48:24.590" style="s2">I think part of that breathing ground is</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:27.830" style="s2">a consequence of a cultural movement</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.590" end="00:48:31.430" style="s2">away from truthfulness it&#39;s been said</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.830" end="00:48:34.790" style="s2">the Asian cultures to shame at face over</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.430" end="00:48:36.050" style="s2">truth and I think in a lot of our in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.790" end="00:48:39.100" style="s2">kind of Western</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.050" end="00:48:41.450" style="s2">century Western century of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.100" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve also had this movement</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.450" end="00:48:45.380" style="s2">away from truthfulness and towards what</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:46.670" style="s2">makes our evils feel good and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.380" end="00:48:49.069" style="s2">you&#39;ve also got the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.670" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">Nietzschean postmodern slant right that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.069" end="00:48:54.349" style="s2">has definitely had a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:58.030" style="s2">trickle-down effect on their being</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.349" end="00:49:01.869" style="s2">completing competing claims for reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.030" end="00:49:06.440" style="s2">right here here&#39;s my my more esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.869" end="00:49:08.869" style="s2">thing which is that I&#39;ve believed that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.440" end="00:49:10.339" style="s2">when we align ourselves subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.869" end="00:49:14.470" style="s2">with a certain principle we&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.339" end="00:49:22.059" style="s2">truthfulness be a discipline be it love</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.470" end="00:49:22.059" style="s2">the that is how the universal ideal</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.329" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">manifests in the particular so that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:30.799" style="s2">transpersonal Plutonian like ideals</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:33.619" style="s2">reforms the way that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.799" end="00:49:35.780" style="s2">manifest in the world is through using</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.619" end="00:49:38.990" style="s2">the human individual as their expression</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.780" end="00:49:40.849" style="s2">and so that when we lean into things</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.990" end="00:49:42.500" style="s2">like truthfulness or love like we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.849" end="00:49:45.859" style="s2">actually aligning with a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.500" end="00:49:47.089" style="s2">transparent transpersonal force I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.859" end="00:49:50.390" style="s2">say this often because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.089" end="00:49:55.490" style="s2">many people like they think I&#39;m not but</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.390" end="00:49:59.270" style="s2">um this isn&#39;t just about information</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.490" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">ecology um coherency I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.270" end="00:50:05.660" style="s2">this is actually we&#39;ve lost sight of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">deeper principle of reality and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.660" end="00:50:11.329" style="s2">pacers and speaks to this right like if</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">like she told the truth like reality is</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.329" end="00:50:15.290" style="s2">on your side and you don&#39;t it&#39;s against</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:22.760" style="s2">you and then it&#39;s all an uphill battle</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.290" end="00:50:24.470" style="s2">from there yeah that&#39;s uh that should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.760" end="00:50:26.210" style="s2">another sessional and so injustice just</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.470" end="00:50:30.619" style="s2">exercising its truthfulness muscle and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.210" end="00:50:32.329" style="s2">how come it&#39;s so hard so before we close</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.619" end="00:50:35.319" style="s2">out would you have any kind of final</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.329" end="00:50:35.319" style="s2">words my friend</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.690" end="00:51:00.140" style="s2">really like a really quality coherent</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.540" end="00:51:01.640" style="s2">group that&#39;s obviously like tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.140" end="00:51:04.550" style="s2">something here that isn&#39;t the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.640" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">San Francisco stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.510" end="00:51:17.990" style="s2">of like a biased against stoicism</p>
