<p begin="00:00:05.370" end="00:00:08.050" style="s2">I&#39;d like to begin by asking you why you<br />think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.050" end="00:00:09.050" style="s2">care about animals and why our dietary choices are so important.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.800" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">Why we should care about animals is because we effect them and it&#39;s important to know how we effect</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.270" end="00:00:21.540" style="s2">them and to be able to really take<br />responsibility for that.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.540" end="00:00:25.330" style="s2">The key for me is the relationship<br />between sentience and sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.330" end="00:00:29.090" style="s2">Sentience is the capacity for something<br />to feel,</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.090" end="00:00:32.989" style="s2">to suffer, to love, to want</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.989" end="00:00:36.440" style="s2">and sovereignty is its freedom to direct<br />its own life.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.440" end="00:00:39.829" style="s2">And I think the essential insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.829" end="00:00:43.610" style="s2">on the topic of rights, whether we&#39;re<br />talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.610" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">rights of other races, rights of<br />women, rights of any group that has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:49.969" style="s2">marginalized, rights other species, </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.969" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">is that if something</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.859" style="s2">is sentient, it should be acknowledged<br />as sovereign.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.859" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">If something has the ability to suffer or<br />to experience joy, if it can feel,</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:05.830" style="s2">it should get to direct its own life<br />according to what would optimize those</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.830" end="00:01:06.730" style="s2">feelings for it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.730" end="00:01:09.880" style="s2">Earlier in human history,</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.880" end="00:01:14.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve subjugated other people in ways<br />that we no longer find okay, through slavery, </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.470" end="00:01:20.780" style="s2">through patriarchal domination and when we progressively came to recognize,</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.780" end="00:01:25.480" style="s2">women or people with another skin color or<br />kids, they feel as much as we do and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.480" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2">life matters and they should have the<br />same sovereign rights, </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:31.690" style="s2">it&#39;s really the next extension of that<br />now to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.690" end="00:01:38.030" style="s2">all the other animal species. And empathy<br />is really this progressive process of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.030" end="00:01:40.310" style="s2">recognizing that things that are<br />different than us</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.310" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">have similarities with us. At first if<br />someone had a different skin color from us,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:45.460" style="s2"> we could make them different enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.460" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">then we could torture them and think it<br />was okay and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.550" style="s2">with more awareness and empathy we start to recognize there&#39;s actually more similarity, </p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">there was enough similarity between us. <br />that we can relate to their experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:01.030" style="s2">and then it wasn&#39;t okay to inflict an<br />experience and then we wouldn&#39;t want.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.030" end="00:02:05.400" style="s2">And the truth is even though animals are<br />very different than us</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.400" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">and many ways, they share hurt</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:13.780" style="s2">and suffering and love and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.780" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">playfulness and depending upon where in<br />the evolutionary spectrum they are they, </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">show those things more less</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">but the ability to feel pain is all the<br />way down the most fundamental animals.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">Recognizing that, we need to take<br />responsibility for how effect them.</p>
