<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:15.020" style="s2">that this event right now works very</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.920" end="00:01:18.020" style="s2">well in with your general thesis about</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.020" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">the state of the world and I read to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.020" end="00:01:21.320" style="s2">your situational assessment that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:23.810" style="s2">published I put that out on my Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.320" end="00:01:24.979" style="s2">feed everybody please read that and I</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.979" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">situational assessment it is serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.409" end="00:01:31.399" style="s2">time those are your big pieces so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">like to pretty much just sort of open up</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.399" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">the floor to you Jordan what have you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:37.869" style="s2">been thinking about what&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:41.000" style="s2">what have you been doing where are we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.869" end="00:01:42.500" style="s2">who well it&#39;s interesting you point that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.000" end="00:01:46.060" style="s2">out because to be honest I thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.500" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">retired from writing things down and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.060" end="00:01:49.909" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the very first one</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:52.939" style="s2">where I was just finding myself spending</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.909" end="00:01:55.430" style="s2">a lot of time giving people more or less</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.939" end="00:01:56.600" style="s2">was in that particular piece right so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.430" end="00:01:58.100" style="s2">figured I might as well just write it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.600" end="00:01:59.630" style="s2">down and share it because it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.100" end="00:02:04.070" style="s2">it was well Franklin&#39;s gonna save me</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.630" end="00:02:06.049" style="s2">some effort but just honestly the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.070" end="00:02:07.159" style="s2">stuff because that means the best you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">you know you&#39;re doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.159" end="00:02:09.979" style="s2">people care about</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">definitely I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been in high</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.979" end="00:02:14.150" style="s2">demand in the last week or two everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:15.769" style="s2">wants to hear what you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.150" end="00:02:17.390" style="s2">this because you&#39;ve really been able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.769" end="00:02:19.820" style="s2">put together a framework that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:23.060" style="s2">people have found a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.820" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">value in so I&#39;m excited to see sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.060" end="00:02:27.739" style="s2">cautiously how this fits into everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:29.690" style="s2">yeah so the question of what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.739" end="00:02:33.820" style="s2">up to I think actually taps pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.690" end="00:02:36.350" style="s2">heavily into the maybe the key thesis</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.820" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.350" end="00:02:38.660" style="s2">more or less than see wouldn&#39;t when did</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:40.580" style="s2">this start ramping it&#39;s hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.660" end="00:02:42.620" style="s2">even recall I got in the RV and headed</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.580" end="00:02:45.860" style="s2">out here gosh about two and a half weeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.620" end="00:02:47.480" style="s2">ago maybe three okay time is compressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.860" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">but it really is is going by very</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.480" end="00:02:51.350" style="s2">quickly its coordination right its</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:53.540" style="s2">coordination it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.770" end="00:03:06.020" style="s2">its necessity in the context of what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.190" end="00:03:19.460" style="s2">real sharp a real salient and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.140" end="00:03:22.420" style="s2">big piece of it for me for the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.460" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">gosh two weeks was straight sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.420" end="00:03:26.390" style="s2">well what&#39;s what&#39;s happening here and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">more importantly what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.390" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">that are going to begin to happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:33.140" style="s2">weeks and months ahead that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:35.780" style="s2">be aware of now because it&#39;s moving so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.140" end="00:03:38.540" style="s2">quickly that our reaction times just</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.780" end="00:03:40.220" style="s2">aren&#39;t ready for it right right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.540" end="00:03:43.310" style="s2">anybody that&#39;s looking at this thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.220" end="00:03:45.710" style="s2">with data current data it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.310" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">stale data and everything that you need</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.710" end="00:03:49.550" style="s2">to really know is like already happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">so somewhere else in the future and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.550" end="00:03:53.330" style="s2">have to be thinking down the road</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:55.700" style="s2">because acting on today&#39;s data is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">going to get us anywhere is it no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.700" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit like if if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:06.590" style="s2">only driven it like 35 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:07.940" style="s2">your whole life and then all sudden</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.590" end="00:04:10.430" style="s2">somebody put an accelerator in the car</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.940" end="00:04:11.690" style="s2">and just floored it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.430" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">and so the instincts that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.690" end="00:04:17.060" style="s2">developed for how to turn and and how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:19.910" style="s2">dodge things in the road at 35 they kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.060" end="00:04:21.620" style="s2">of work at 36 and 37 and 38 and 39 but</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.910" end="00:04:24.620" style="s2">before you know it you&#39;re going 50 and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.620" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">70 and 80 and 90 and 120 and 150 you got</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.620" end="00:04:30.620" style="s2">a fancy car and that can get very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">disorienting if you&#39;re still using 35</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.620" end="00:04:33.920" style="s2">mile an hour reflexes right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">this thing is something is happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.920" end="00:04:38.450" style="s2">fast ie exponential fast and we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:40.070" style="s2">talk about that is a very specific thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.450" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s also happening happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.070" end="00:04:45.770" style="s2">complex and that&#39;s another problem I</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">think that arises in trying to grasp how</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.770" end="00:04:49.460" style="s2">to deal with it you know you&#39;re in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:49.990" style="s2">sense we&#39;re not really dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.460" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">virus</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.990" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">or to put it another way we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:56.500" style="s2">with the meta virus of which a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:04:57.730" style="s2">biological virus is just one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.500" end="00:04:59.410" style="s2">there&#39;s probably many we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.730" end="00:05:02.050" style="s2">about it very interesting way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">thinking about it now I said I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">want to get too much in the background</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:06.700" style="s2">but you&#39;ve used the word sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:08.890" style="s2">I&#39;m using this word quite a bit myself -</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.700" end="00:05:10.930" style="s2">maybe you could sort of put that into</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.890" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">context for people sense making what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.930" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">what is that and and what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:18.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re a node in a sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:19.810" style="s2">network of a an open cognition network</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:21.730" style="s2">this is very important concept for</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.810" end="00:05:23.650" style="s2">people it&#39;s nice I remember why I like</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.730" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">talking to you always make me explain</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.650" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">things in a way that makes sense there</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">you go right that&#39;s it exactly doing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">just exactly taking perception so sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:35.260" style="s2">making is perceiving right so just</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:38.380" style="s2">listening and looking and hearing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.260" end="00:05:40.870" style="s2">then and by the way as we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.380" end="00:05:42.490" style="s2">that in the past disciplining in</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.870" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">training with your entire instruments</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.490" end="00:05:45.160" style="s2">you&#39;re using everything every aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">your body or in mind to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.160" end="00:05:50.260" style="s2">really perceive what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:53.470" style="s2">reality and then be able to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.260" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">together into something that I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.470" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">you know it makes sense it hangs</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.180" end="00:06:00.850" style="s2">together there&#39;s a way of grasping of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:03.160" style="s2">presenting yourself in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.850" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">reality where you can then make good</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">choices I mean it sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:11.260" style="s2">how to say abstract but if you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">about it in a very concrete notion if</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.260" end="00:06:15.640" style="s2">like when you&#39;re shooting a basketball</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:17.170" style="s2">the way that you poised your body and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.640" end="00:06:18.970" style="s2">you bring your elbow in to the center if</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.170" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">you regret the center of your chest you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.970" end="00:06:22.030" style="s2">bring your wrist back you balance the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">ball in your hand like that&#39;s sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.030" end="00:06:25.960" style="s2">you let&#39;s bring your body into an</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">affordance into a position so then your</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.960" end="00:06:29.590" style="s2">action taking is a very fluid connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.270" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening and it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.590" end="00:06:36.730" style="s2">relationship to experience right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:39.730" style="s2">and the reason that we are having this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.730" end="00:06:41.380" style="s2">crisis of sense making is because our</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.730" end="00:06:43.180" style="s2">old sense making tools are now obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.380" end="00:06:45.190" style="s2">right those are the 35 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.180" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">ones that we had before yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.190" end="00:06:49.510" style="s2">kind of runs in two directions we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.580" style="s2">the the ones that we have as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.510" end="00:06:53.560" style="s2">you know just are our own particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.580" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">individual capabilities and faculties</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.560" end="00:06:56.980" style="s2">and that of course varies quite widely</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.760" end="00:07:00.220" style="s2">there some people may be seals for</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.980" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">example who were trained operate at a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.220" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">lot faster than 35 miles an hour and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:06.910" style="s2">when the world seems to speed up for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:09.220" style="s2">everybody else for them it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.910" end="00:07:10.389" style="s2">slow down and there&#39;s a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.220" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">people for whom that&#39;s the case but</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.389" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">broadly speaking the world that we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:19.270" style="s2">used to has been training us to operate</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">using a certain style of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.270" end="00:07:27.040" style="s2">using a certain style of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:29.290" style="s2">that is well let&#39;s just put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.040" end="00:07:31.180" style="s2">is appropriate for for a slower time a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.290" end="00:07:34.650" style="s2">simpler time right the nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.180" end="00:07:38.020" style="s2">seventies and then the flip side this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.650" end="00:07:39.550" style="s2">actually equally important is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.020" end="00:07:42.010" style="s2">institutions of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.550" end="00:07:44.590" style="s2">you know like Walter Cronkite let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.010" end="00:07:47.169" style="s2">be very very concrete Walter Cronkite</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:49.480" style="s2">and the mind the kind of mind that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.169" end="00:07:53.020" style="s2">listening to Walter Cronkite made plenty</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.480" end="00:07:56.320" style="s2">of sense in 1969 yeah and does not make</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.020" end="00:07:58.540" style="s2">any sense at all in 2020 no and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.320" end="00:07:59.979" style="s2">because we have five billion Walter</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.540" end="00:08:01.690" style="s2">Cronkite&#39;s now right and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.979" end="00:08:02.979" style="s2">talking to us and we&#39;re all listening</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.690" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">right well that&#39;s a real part of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.979" end="00:08:06.970" style="s2">meena one of the challenges one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:08.950" style="s2">upsides and the downsides I mean when</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.970" end="00:08:10.810" style="s2">the downside is there&#39;s noise everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.950" end="00:08:12.729" style="s2">a lot of that noise by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.810" end="00:08:15.850" style="s2">increasingly sophisticated intentional</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.729" end="00:08:17.320" style="s2">disinfo noise yeah a lot of dumbasses</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.850" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">same things that they should just be</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.320" end="00:08:22.270" style="s2">silent about but I make experience quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">a bit of that on Twitter lately I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.270" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">Twitter was designed for it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.490" end="00:08:31.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s the upside - yep and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.850" end="00:08:33.479" style="s2">are talking on that same exact Network</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.350" end="00:08:34.770" style="s2">so hopefully we&#39;ll do a better job than</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.479" end="00:08:38.099" style="s2">those guys we were just slurred on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.770" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">Twitter exactly right exactly right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.099" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">concepts for a while about how the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:47.640" style="s2">is now talking to itself many too many</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:49.589" style="s2">instead of one too many and the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.640" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">communication structures information</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.589" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">distribution networks of the past are</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.190" style="s2">gone and now information is flying</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:08:59.010" style="s2">around everywhere and that has pros and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.190" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">cons and in this case how do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.010" end="00:09:02.820" style="s2">pros working out like how is it working</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:04.260" style="s2">out for you personally what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.820" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">happening what are you what are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.260" end="00:09:08.310" style="s2">seeing how is it happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:10.620" style="s2">systematically for you right now to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.310" end="00:09:13.050" style="s2">participant in this open source</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.620" end="00:09:16.170" style="s2">cognition network of which you&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.050" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2">hand in sort of formulating the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.170" end="00:09:25.170" style="s2">around I think that&#39;s true well it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.170" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">do I say this right the experience that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.170" end="00:09:31.740" style="s2">I&#39;m that I&#39;m noticing is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">little bit like would it be imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.740" end="00:09:39.959" style="s2">you just had a crowd of people and music</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:41.339" style="s2">was beginning to be sung we didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.959" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">know what the song was I guess we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.339" end="00:09:45.180" style="s2">doing the Jazz metaphor again but now</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">it&#39;s much larger than people yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.180" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">the trick is you&#39;ve got a voice which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:52.490" style="s2">to say you&#39;ve got a particular piece of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:54.510" style="s2">the music that&#39;s yours to sing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.490" end="00:09:56.100" style="s2">imagine everybody in the crowd is sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.510" end="00:09:57.959" style="s2">of milling about and you listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.100" end="00:09:59.820" style="s2">people around you and you notice okay no</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.959" end="00:10:01.170" style="s2">no that&#39;s not I move here a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.820" end="00:10:03.510" style="s2">there that&#39;s my part and I&#39;m next to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.170" end="00:10:04.920" style="s2">that person until it finally it arranges</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.510" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">itself from a crowd of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.920" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">sort of trying to figure it out to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.529" style="s2">acquire this thing in Beethoven&#39;s Ninth</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:11.940" style="s2">Symphony right that&#39;s the experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.529" end="00:10:13.529" style="s2">that I&#39;m having right getting on</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.940" end="00:10:15.060" style="s2">conversations talking to people trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.529" end="00:10:17.130" style="s2">to figure out okay what piece do I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.060" end="00:10:18.690" style="s2">how can I help who can I know choose the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.130" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2">right person for me to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.690" end="00:10:22.890" style="s2">in what order what are we missing like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:24.990" style="s2">all that like really really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.890" end="00:10:26.459" style="s2">get a handle on how do we actually use</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.990" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">the possibility how do we use the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.459" end="00:10:29.459" style="s2">capability for literally anybody on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:30.899" style="s2">planet to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.459" end="00:10:33.510" style="s2">anybody else on the planet in any</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.899" end="00:10:38.310" style="s2">combination using audio video text</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.510" end="00:10:39.690" style="s2">whatever to go from noise to signal</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.310" end="00:10:41.460" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.690" end="00:10:43.880" style="s2">and how do you think that that&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.460" end="00:10:46.500" style="s2">out right now generally speaking with</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.880" end="00:10:48.330" style="s2">you know John Rob is telling me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.500" end="00:10:50.520" style="s2">everyone else that the the the answers</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.330" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">and solutions to the to the corona</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.520" end="00:10:54.390" style="s2">crisis are gonna be crowd-sourced open</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:55.950" style="s2">source it&#39;s part of the open source</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.390" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">intelligence networks open source</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.950" end="00:11:00.330" style="s2">cognition are you seeing that what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:02.370" style="s2">are you seeing and then let&#39;s try to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.330" end="00:11:03.780" style="s2">into some specifics yeah okay this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.370" end="00:11:05.670" style="s2">- there&#39;s some really powerful stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.780" end="00:11:06.870" style="s2">here so one of the challenges one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.670" end="00:11:08.250" style="s2">real challenges of what I&#39;d call the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.870" end="00:11:09.930" style="s2">blue church we talked about that a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.250" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">couple times ago of course it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.930" end="00:11:14.370" style="s2">old the old-style way of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:17.130" style="s2">you know radio stations and newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.370" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">and you know three three three increment</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.130" end="00:11:23.700" style="s2">on a dial is that it&#39;s a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">band I think an only can only tell so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.700" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">much in an hour and a half long segment</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:30.180" style="s2">and so they have to pick of all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:31.740" style="s2">stories that they could tell they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">to pick the handful of stories they can</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">tell and it&#39;s kind of one size fits all</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:40.170" style="s2">which really means one size fits more or</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">less nobody now</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.170" end="00:11:44.580" style="s2">I can&#39;t help it but you might imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:46.080" style="s2">that there was a time both of us were</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.580" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">quite young when they were doing a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.080" end="00:11:48.780" style="s2">really really good job of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:51.630" style="s2">actually figure out what was the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.780" end="00:11:55.310" style="s2">stuff to say and of course over the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.630" end="00:11:57.300" style="s2">40 years or so the necessities of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.310" end="00:11:58.830" style="s2">marketing is met they figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.300" end="00:12:00.270" style="s2">tell the most compelling stuff to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.830" end="00:12:02.130" style="s2">the most salient laughs not the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.270" end="00:12:03.780" style="s2">relevant stuff to use our friend John</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.130" end="00:12:07.140" style="s2">for Vicky&#39;s very good terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.780" end="00:12:10.520" style="s2">yeah but in this in this digital medium</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.140" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">it has infinite bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.520" end="00:12:15.580" style="s2">it&#39;s infinite which means that I can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:20.030" style="s2">in principle exactly what I need to hear</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.580" end="00:12:22.070" style="s2">one size fits you personally now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.030" end="00:12:23.240" style="s2">not easy just yet and unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.070" end="00:12:24.680" style="s2">guys who were supposed to be doing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.240" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">good job like Facebook and Twitter have</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.680" end="00:12:28.850" style="s2">been doing an absolutely abysmal job but</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:31.010" style="s2">the potential still there and I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.850" end="00:12:32.810" style="s2">it happen so let&#39;s give you an example I</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:29.510" style="s2">can distribute it all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.010" end="00:13:31.070" style="s2">edge and by the way you can make</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.510" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">absolutely sure that there is somebody</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:37.520" style="s2">actually walk it over well these days</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.580" end="00:13:46.760" style="s2">be done by self-organization but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">nobody from the government who&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.760" end="00:13:50.390" style="s2">in to say we&#39;re weird we&#39;re here to help</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:54.020" style="s2">you that was a really important solution</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.390" end="00:13:55.430" style="s2">in 1947 these days to pretty much get in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.020" end="00:13:56.420" style="s2">the way except for a rare few who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.430" end="00:14:00.140" style="s2">doing an exemplary job</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.420" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not necessarily limits in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.140" end="00:14:05.810" style="s2">just that I mean there are like people</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">are I just looked at an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.810" end="00:14:11.480" style="s2">website that takes the the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:15.110" style="s2">was being told by Johns Hopkins and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.480" end="00:14:16.970" style="s2">he uses the actual data from Wuhan so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.110" end="00:14:19.730" style="s2">the real data that described an overlay</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.970" end="00:14:21.740" style="s2">map of the number of reported cases and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.730" end="00:14:22.970" style="s2">the number of what they call the actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.740" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">cases so that the Chinese authorities</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.970" end="00:14:25.740" style="s2">went through and actually interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:27.840" style="s2">people said okay tell me one exists when</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.740" end="00:14:31.080" style="s2">your symptoms first started show it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.840" end="00:14:33.000" style="s2">right and then they said then they back</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.080" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">projected that onto a chart and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.000" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">got this really nice map that shows holy</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.940" style="s2">smokes by the time we actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:41.460" style="s2">case diagnosed in the hospital we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:43.530" style="s2">already got a thousand cases that have</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.460" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">actually got symptoms around in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.530" end="00:14:47.430" style="s2">environment that was some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:49.650" style="s2">structure they&#39;re showing so these this</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.430" end="00:14:52.170" style="s2">team and maybe it&#39;s just one one person</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.650" end="00:14:54.210" style="s2">took that model took the real-time data</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:55.590" style="s2">built a bunch of software that could</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.210" end="00:14:57.090" style="s2">take all the inputs that were coming in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.590" end="00:14:58.620" style="s2">from the world build some algorithms to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.090" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">create some variances projected it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.620" end="00:15:03.240" style="s2">against the the visualization plow from</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:04.890" style="s2">Johns Hopkins this create an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.240" end="00:15:07.080" style="s2">new way of looking at it well you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.890" end="00:15:09.180" style="s2">actually get a sense of a projected</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.080" end="00:15:10.140" style="s2">model of the number of actual cases in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.180" end="00:15:13.980" style="s2">your environment which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.140" end="00:15:15.420" style="s2">different thing and that&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.980" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a valuable resource to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.420" end="00:15:20.700" style="s2">available similarly I just spent some</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:23.070" style="s2">time today working with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.700" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">scientists and doctors who are have</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.070" end="00:15:27.930" style="s2">self-organized to curate the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.840" style="s2">literature and try to provide the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.930" end="00:15:32.280" style="s2">current up-to-date synthetic information</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.840" end="00:15:33.840" style="s2">to synthesize all the data that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.280" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">produced by all these people all over</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.840" end="00:15:37.710" style="s2">the world who are getting real-time</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">information and bring it in and provided</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.710" end="00:15:42.510" style="s2">as a resource to literally anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:44.040" style="s2">wants it and again that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.510" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">today just people can you coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.040" end="00:15:48.180" style="s2">and I think this is a thing that gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:50.220" style="s2">lost we kind of named things</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.180" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">institutions as if they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.220" end="00:15:55.950" style="s2">like like Johns Hopkins I named it as if</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:57.840" style="s2">John Hoffa the real place a real it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.950" end="00:15:59.520" style="s2">a how do I do this then it did stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.840" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">Johns Hopkins doesn&#39;t do anything if</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.520" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">there&#39;s people at Johns Hopkins which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:06.150" style="s2">good thing or a place bunch of it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">people who are doing it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.150" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the inside the inside is at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">end of day it&#39;s always been people</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:12.840" style="s2">choosing to do stuff and now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:15.090" style="s2">happening is we&#39;re discovering is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.840" end="00:16:17.310" style="s2">the right people can work with other</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.090" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">right people to do really good stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.310" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">they can do it fast and they can do it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:24.060" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say like the old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.660" end="00:16:26.370" style="s2">way which is using their own sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.060" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">making and making their own choices for</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.370" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2">what they think is exactly the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:32.499" style="s2">important thing for them to be focused</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:35.259" style="s2">on and that becomes very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.499" end="00:16:38.499" style="s2">it seems to me that this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.259" end="00:16:40.329" style="s2">engaging far more intellectual power and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.499" end="00:16:42.129" style="s2">capability than perhaps some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.329" end="00:16:45.549" style="s2">older ways of doing things you know so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.129" end="00:16:48.159" style="s2">would this in your mind accelerate any</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.549" end="00:16:51.009" style="s2">potential solutions that we can find or</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.159" end="00:16:53.889" style="s2">are we creating dead ends or obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.009" end="00:16:56.469" style="s2">or oh how are we how are we surfacing</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.889" end="00:16:58.599" style="s2">the right things out of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.469" end="00:17:01.629" style="s2">cacophony of information that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.599" end="00:17:03.039" style="s2">there this is a real problem so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.629" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">talk a little bit about the history of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.039" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">the Internet as an example because these</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:09.579" style="s2">things tend to go through very specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.939" end="00:17:11.379" style="s2">cycles and we&#39;re like halfway through</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.579" end="00:17:12.579" style="s2">one of those cycles right now and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.379" end="00:17:14.289" style="s2">imagine that as a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.579" end="00:17:16.689" style="s2">crisis we&#39;ll move all the way through it</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.289" end="00:17:20.049" style="s2">of this part of the way so back when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.689" end="00:17:24.089" style="s2">the www right the world wide web portion</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.049" end="00:17:24.089" style="s2">of the internet first started yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.310" end="00:17:27.430" style="s2">there weren&#39;t that many eight websites</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.510" end="00:17:28.690" style="s2">and so you can kind of know all of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.430" end="00:17:30.670" style="s2">we&#39;re all the ones that were relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.690" end="00:17:32.290" style="s2">you you keep them in your head you look</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.670" end="00:17:34.060" style="s2">back in the day to Mecca you need your</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.290" end="00:17:35.860" style="s2">friend&#39;s phone numbers you just know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.060" end="00:17:40.060" style="s2">that you know the URL and type the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.860" end="00:17:41.650" style="s2">thing in literally demonym eww right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.060" end="00:17:43.960" style="s2">after not too long there was just too</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.650" end="00:17:47.080" style="s2">many so you couldn&#39;t get an information</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.960" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">overload and so Jerry Yang said well</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.080" end="00:17:50.380" style="s2">I&#39;ll go ahead and just start creating a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.210" style="s2">taxon I mean categorize all the websites</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.380" end="00:17:53.890" style="s2">and I will carefully go out and create</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.210" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">bookmarks of linking to all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.890" end="00:17:57.910" style="s2">I&#39;ll publish that as a website of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:17:59.590" style="s2">own yahoo becomes an information</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.910" end="00:18:01.930" style="s2">repository to take care of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.590" end="00:18:04.360" style="s2">of information overload and that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.930" end="00:18:06.730" style="s2">that right and so that&#39;s how we cycle</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.360" end="00:18:09.850" style="s2">through and by the way blogs originally</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.730" end="00:18:11.560" style="s2">blogs were that kind of thing a blog was</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.850" end="00:18:13.270" style="s2">a collection of websites that were</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.560" end="00:18:15.130" style="s2">curated to be around a particular topic</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.270" end="00:18:16.600" style="s2">and then we had so many blogs that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.130" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">needed some sort of other architecture</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.600" end="00:18:19.690" style="s2">to be able to capture the blog&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:21.460" style="s2">happening now so it&#39;s happening now is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.690" end="00:18:23.920" style="s2">that we have so many projects for</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.460" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">example that are coming out in so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.920" end="00:18:28.090" style="s2">different dimensions that it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.520" style="s2">become information overload instead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.090" end="00:18:32.230" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to find the resources I</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.520" end="00:18:33.610" style="s2">want cuz there&#39;s they&#39;re scarce it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.230" end="00:18:35.020" style="s2">time for me from the resources that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.610" end="00:18:36.490" style="s2">need because they&#39;re they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.020" end="00:18:38.170" style="s2">abundant so we&#39;re going through a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.490" end="00:18:39.580" style="s2">process right now people seeing that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.170" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">beginning to create structure creating</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.580" end="00:18:46.060" style="s2">mechanisms to to create taxonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:47.470" style="s2">tools to categorize and simplify and by</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.060" end="00:18:49.240" style="s2">the way to curate in increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.470" end="00:18:51.850" style="s2">scalable ways so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.240" end="00:18:53.170" style="s2">ultimately get what they need and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.850" end="00:18:57.160" style="s2">building out infrastructure I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.170" end="00:19:00.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the face right there&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.160" end="00:19:03.340" style="s2">of like awareness just some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.610" end="00:19:04.930" style="s2">become aware of a possibility then</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.340" end="00:19:06.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a process of exploration they</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.930" end="00:19:08.710" style="s2">just begin playing with it and learning</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.310" end="00:19:10.540" style="s2">in it and they start working around then</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.710" end="00:19:12.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a process of skillfulness that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.540" end="00:19:13.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a okay I get how you do this and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.040" end="00:19:15.700" style="s2">they start working on it then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.810" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">emulation other people can learn very</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.700" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">quickly from the skillful individuals</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:21.700" style="s2">who are doing something and they begin</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:24.220" style="s2">doing it then there&#39;s the process of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.700" end="00:19:26.440" style="s2">infrastructure okay we&#39;ve got something</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.220" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">more or less hammered now need to turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.440" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">this into a layer like something that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.570" end="00:19:32.290" style="s2">durable that other people who come on</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">top of it more or less get it for free</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.290" end="00:19:35.320" style="s2">and they can keep make and then go</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:37.410" style="s2">through that process again from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.320" end="00:19:37.410" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.490" end="00:19:46.110" style="s2">yeah and this thing is tricky because</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.980" end="00:19:48.630" style="s2">there&#39;s so many dimensions to it you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.110" end="00:19:49.860" style="s2">know I have been spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.630" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">this is fun</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.860" end="00:19:55.380" style="s2">a lot of time trying to figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.420" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to generate a truly</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.380" end="00:20:00.540" style="s2">effective legitimate alternate currency</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.559" style="s2">model and let me tell you why so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:04.260" style="s2">here&#39;s the way it works like here&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.559" end="00:20:07.020" style="s2">a case study so I&#39;m sitting with with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.260" end="00:20:08.220" style="s2">group of people and virtually and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.020" end="00:20:10.260" style="s2">trying to think through what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.220" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">various sensitive points the points</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.260" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">where important things can happen like</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:17.040" style="s2">if you get it right it works out if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:18.210" style="s2">get it wrong so it&#39;s quite bad so what</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.040" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">are the sensitive points they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.210" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">down the pipe</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.680" end="00:20:26.270" style="s2">second or third order consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.750" end="00:20:28.910" style="s2">the virus yeah and pretty quickly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.270" end="00:20:31.100" style="s2">like okay this thing&#39;s gonna either you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.910" end="00:20:33.350" style="s2">quarantine you you don&#39;t and either way</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:34.220" style="s2">you&#39;re shutting down the economy if</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.350" end="00:20:35.420" style="s2">you&#39;re quarantined you&#39;re shutting it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:36.560" style="s2">down cuz you tell me buddy to go home if</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.420" end="00:20:37.550" style="s2">you don&#39;t you&#39;re shutting down because</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.560" end="00:20:39.080" style="s2">everybody eventually goes home because</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.550" end="00:20:40.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to get sick whether you</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:42.740" style="s2">run whether you&#39;re running Italy or</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.730" end="00:20:45.140" style="s2">you&#39;re running China either way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.740" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">shutting down the economy and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.140" end="00:20:47.930" style="s2">particular you&#39;re shutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">aspects of the economy that involve</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.930" end="00:20:51.830" style="s2">people congregated like bars and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">restaurants and musical venues and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.830" end="00:20:57.140" style="s2">things like that and a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:20:59.720" style="s2">well 70% of the population is living</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.140" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">more or less paycheck to paycheck and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.720" end="00:21:04.100" style="s2">sizable fraction of that group has about</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">$1,000 cash in the bank or less which</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.100" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">means that if you shut down the economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got people who in particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:13.220" style="s2">who are in vocations that don&#39;t pay them</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.390" style="s2">paid leave for not being at work you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.220" end="00:21:15.800" style="s2">gonna have a sizeable fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.390" end="00:21:19.400" style="s2">population you just flat out run out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.800" end="00:21:20.870" style="s2">money in two four six eight weeks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.400" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">this thing could easily run that long</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.870" end="00:21:25.430" style="s2">all right well that&#39;s a problem if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">got 70 million people who literally just</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.430" end="00:21:29.690" style="s2">ran out of cash because we had to shut</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.890" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">down the economy to deal with the virus</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.690" end="00:21:33.680" style="s2">issue now I&#39;ve got 70,000 people who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:34.820" style="s2">either choosing to well one they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.680" end="00:21:36.680" style="s2">gonna miss their rent or mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.820" end="00:21:38.030" style="s2">payments but they may actually be run</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.680" end="00:21:39.380" style="s2">out of food and water and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.030" end="00:21:41.060" style="s2">afford to get it so what do they did to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.380" end="00:21:42.260" style="s2">this starve to - did they start stealing</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.060" end="00:21:45.110" style="s2">it from other people what&#39;s that look</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.260" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">like well Stefan lis not good unless we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.110" end="00:21:47.630" style="s2">can figure out how to make it good it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:48.140" style="s2">an opportunity so we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.630" end="00:21:50.060" style="s2">figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.140" end="00:21:51.170" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of really cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.060" end="00:21:56.090" style="s2">approaches and this is the ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.170" end="00:21:57.920" style="s2">there&#39;s probably at this point 60,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.090" end="00:21:59.929" style="s2">people who are thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.920" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.929" end="00:22:03.499" style="s2">people off on the road and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:05.809" style="s2">about seven groups that are congregating</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.499" end="00:22:07.249" style="s2">and everybody there&#39;s got a unique</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.809" end="00:22:09.019" style="s2">perspective and some have some very</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.249" end="00:22:10.070" style="s2">powerful ideas our particular team was</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.019" end="00:22:12.070" style="s2">looking at it saying cuz I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.070" end="00:22:14.570" style="s2">background in the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.070" end="00:22:15.889" style="s2">you know one solution has been promoted</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.570" end="00:22:17.809" style="s2">from the top down which is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.889" end="00:22:19.009" style="s2">fine solution MIT Romney came on I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.809" end="00:22:20.840" style="s2">supporting it today</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.009" end="00:22:22.700" style="s2">well has just sent a check of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.840" end="00:22:24.049" style="s2">dollars every American family you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.700" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">just make that happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.049" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">and that could happen and I think it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:30.230" style="s2">be quite a good idea although I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:31.490" style="s2">checks are probably a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.230" end="00:22:32.899" style="s2">obsolete since you can&#39;t actually go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.490" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">the bank but any event there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.899" end="00:22:37.700" style="s2">solving it now okay but I&#39;ve got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:38.809" style="s2">got extra bandwidth there&#39;s folks who</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.700" end="00:22:39.980" style="s2">are thinking about that and I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.809" end="00:22:42.259" style="s2">to worry about that if they pull it off</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">great problem solved on to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.259" end="00:22:45.889" style="s2">but if they drop the ball we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:47.210" style="s2">have a solution in place we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.889" end="00:22:48.440" style="s2">hope that the government&#39;s gonna figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.210" end="00:22:49.700" style="s2">it out if they don&#39;t figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.440" end="00:22:51.409" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:54.259" style="s2">so one solution we&#39;ve been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.409" end="00:22:56.289" style="s2">was a dusting off a white paper that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.259" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">actually read back in like 2008</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.289" end="00:23:02.330" style="s2">peer-to-peer mutual credit system and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:05.179" style="s2">we&#39;ve literally been going through doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.330" end="00:23:06.379" style="s2">design mathematical modeling grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.179" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">folks who actually have the technical</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.379" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">skill set to build the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:10.999" style="s2">platform fortunately because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:12.710" style="s2">cryptocurrency thing was such a big</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.999" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">amount of time and energy and resources</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.710" end="00:23:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a lot of good code out</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">there and it&#39;s looking pretty good so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.450" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">is entirely feasible that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:27.559" style="s2">is this and then April shows up and for</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:29.659" style="s2">whatever reason the government decided</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.559" end="00:23:31.999" style="s2">not to pull the trigger and $1,000 in</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.659" end="00:23:33.350" style="s2">people&#39;s pockets and then and I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.999" end="00:23:34.999" style="s2">show up like patent at the Battle of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:37.869" style="s2">Bulge and say yep we already got it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.999" end="00:23:40.519" style="s2">figured out here&#39;s the solution go and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.869" end="00:23:42.499" style="s2">that&#39;s what we should be doing do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.519" end="00:23:43.730" style="s2">care to give some details on that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.499" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">sounds fascinating to me a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.730" end="00:23:47.269" style="s2">mutual credit system I&#39;m gonna get real</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:48.740" style="s2">nerdy that&#39;s gonna waste a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.269" end="00:23:50.929" style="s2">we could do it a different situation</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.740" end="00:23:52.340" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll do a different time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.929" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">talking about the financial the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.340" end="00:23:57.049" style="s2">financial effects and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:23:58.279" style="s2">what you thought about the comparison on</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.049" end="00:24:00.499" style="s2">a number of different levels between</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.279" end="00:24:02.899" style="s2">David you hope you suckered me I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.499" end="00:24:04.309" style="s2">tell you now all right dudes I am I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.899" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">little bit enthusiastic about it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.309" end="00:24:07.490" style="s2">so here&#39;s the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:10.249" style="s2">and I apologize for a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.490" end="00:24:12.499" style="s2">things are abstract but the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.249" end="00:24:13.250" style="s2">is to actually take in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.499" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.250" end="00:24:20.390" style="s2">we have a bunch of different things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:22.670" style="s2">money does we have money as a as a unit</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.390" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">of account like it&#39;s five dollars you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.670" end="00:24:25.970" style="s2">have to be able to say like how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:30.170" style="s2">units of value is this particular object</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.970" end="00:24:34.040" style="s2">it was a medium of exchange and we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.170" end="00:24:36.620" style="s2">a way of keeping track of accounting</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.040" end="00:24:38.300" style="s2">metric and typically when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.620" end="00:24:40.310" style="s2">money we think about in terms of mostly</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.300" end="00:24:42.350" style="s2">a medium of exchange right you give me a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.310" end="00:24:44.300" style="s2">loaf of bread I give you five of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.350" end="00:24:45.980" style="s2">green pieces of paper and you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.300" end="00:24:48.260" style="s2">thank you and you walk walk away right</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.980" end="00:24:50.210" style="s2">but you can also look at it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.260" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">an of an accounting ledger which is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.210" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">say that you give me the loaf of bread</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:57.680" style="s2">and I give you the IOU for that loaf of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:24:59.720" style="s2">bread and we could just say five units</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.680" end="00:25:01.160" style="s2">so five units of value has now been</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.720" end="00:25:03.350" style="s2">transferred I&#39;m in the red five and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.160" end="00:25:04.910" style="s2">you&#39;re in the green five okay so a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.350" end="00:25:07.430" style="s2">peer-to-peer mutual credit uses that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.910" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">concept everybody starts at zero just</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.430" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">imagine now the hard part here is</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">actually some slightly less autistic</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:15.620" style="s2">than me people are gonna have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:17.330" style="s2">out actually make other people feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.620" end="00:25:19.670" style="s2">really good about doing it but in the in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.330" end="00:25:21.290" style="s2">the context of crisis it might happen so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.670" end="00:25:23.060" style="s2">you show up with this with this app you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.290" end="00:25:24.380" style="s2">get a now what the app does it says okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.060" end="00:25:26.630" style="s2">who are all the people who you truly</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.380" end="00:25:28.100" style="s2">you&#39;re friends with and we may actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.630" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">have to do to run Dunbar numbers to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.100" end="00:25:31.930" style="s2">really interesting powerful reasons so</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.890" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">to solve when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.730" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">investment capital that&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:31.910" style="s2">thing so if I go to the store now and I</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.110" end="00:26:35.390" style="s2">that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.010" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">one thing is he looks at me and says oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.390" end="00:26:38.570" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re married I know you you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.250" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">happens is he gets three credits in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.950" end="00:26:46.220" style="s2">green and I get three credits in the in</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">the red but he can actually spend those</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.220" end="00:26:48.980" style="s2">three credits with somebody else or</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.410" style="s2">actually created kind of a money that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.980" end="00:26:53.390" style="s2">can move but murder he doesn&#39;t know me</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.410" end="00:26:55.400" style="s2">so in this app what happens is he gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.390" end="00:26:57.800" style="s2">to discover the people who he knows and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.400" end="00:26:59.270" style="s2">gives credit to who are in relationship</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.160" end="00:27:22.490" style="s2">the fact that hey Jack ouches for this</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:39.560" style="s2">problem and at that point we call n plus</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.590" style="s2">the farther somebody waits to be just</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:50.390" style="s2">like the way your gut tells you I mean</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.320" end="00:28:42.350" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying it needs to happen or</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.090" end="00:28:43.430" style="s2">it should happen or it&#39;s awesome but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.350" end="00:28:46.460" style="s2">just saying that&#39;s the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.430" end="00:28:47.750" style="s2">that we&#39;re capable of right now and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.460" end="00:28:49.430" style="s2">allows us to do a little belts and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:51.230" style="s2">suspenders if the government mails</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.090" end="00:29:13.190" style="s2">great place to experiment with something</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.970" end="00:29:15.530" style="s2">like this liminal order being this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.190" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">that we&#39;ve built which is also not only</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.530" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">a men&#39;s community dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:22.520" style="s2">increasing our personal sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.860" style="s2">our independence and autoregulation but</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.520" end="00:29:26.810" style="s2">it&#39;s also become a very powerful sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.860" end="00:29:29.810" style="s2">making apparatus and an intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.810" end="00:29:31.910" style="s2">network yep and we have been for the</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.430" end="00:29:50.500" style="s2">been incredible because Jordan we talked</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.170" end="00:29:53.480" style="s2">well before limo owner was ever created</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.500" end="00:29:55.310" style="s2">and it&#39;s now nine months old with 200</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.310" end="00:30:00.740" style="s2">across the world and the guys are really</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.250" end="00:30:02.780" style="s2">feeling the power of the network right</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.740" end="00:30:04.550" style="s2">now because they&#39;re all at home safe and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.780" end="00:30:05.810" style="s2">secure and stocked and their loved ones</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.810" end="00:30:09.140" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re ready and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.490" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">totally unsurprised by everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.140" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">going on in fact the corona room we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:15.650" style="s2">is slowing down in traffic now because</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:17.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of figured out what we needed</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.650" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">to do and now that time is really just</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.690" end="00:30:21.920" style="s2">to sit back and sort of wait and those</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:23.030" style="s2">check it every one was a yep curves off</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.920" end="00:30:25.640" style="s2">the curve we thought it was gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.030" end="00:30:26.990" style="s2">bright yeah and it is unfortunately on</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:29.810" style="s2">the curve that we thought it was going</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.990" end="00:30:34.100" style="s2">to be on and sort of about that and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.810" end="00:30:36.980" style="s2">wuhan data together and your own take on</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.100" end="00:30:39.320" style="s2">the virus itself I&#39;m curious to get your</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.980" end="00:30:41.150" style="s2">perception I know that the number of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.320" end="00:30:43.130" style="s2">reported cases are quite low it seems</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.150" end="00:30:44.150" style="s2">the number of reported deaths are quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.130" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">low</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.150" end="00:30:49.490" style="s2">and it takes some real thinking into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:52.280" style="s2">future to be able to act in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.490" end="00:30:54.650" style="s2">people are acting today do you what what</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.280" end="00:30:56.870" style="s2">how much confidence do you have in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.650" end="00:31:00.350" style="s2">numbers that are coming out of China how</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.870" end="00:31:03.080" style="s2">much confidence do you have in you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.350" end="00:31:06.350" style="s2">the the actual lethality of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.080" end="00:31:08.180" style="s2">does it even matter what is your take I</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.350" end="00:31:11.030" style="s2">mean obviously you&#39;re moving ahead as if</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.180" end="00:31:12.980" style="s2">as if the virus in it of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.030" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">actually a real powerful dangerous thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.980" end="00:31:18.110" style="s2">that we need to be concerned with or is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:19.580" style="s2">it I mean I&#39;m not like a naysayer by any</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.110" end="00:31:22.600" style="s2">means but I&#39;m interested to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.580" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">your interpretation of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.600" end="00:31:27.290" style="s2">epidemiology and of the well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:28.490" style="s2">unfortunate I don&#39;t have to be there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.290" end="00:31:29.570" style="s2">lot of folks we&#39;re a lot smarter than me</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.490" end="00:31:32.740" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just going to tell you what a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:35.060" style="s2">where the the people who I think are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.740" end="00:31:35.960" style="s2">well let me take a step back actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.060" end="00:31:40.330" style="s2">before we go that because I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.960" end="00:31:40.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a little order let me just sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:46.560" style="s2">sovereignty mm-hmm that&#39;s crucial right</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.660" style="s2">in times like this the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.560" end="00:31:50.250" style="s2">actually to kind of be the rock and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.660" end="00:31:51.960" style="s2">water flows around you and you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.250" end="00:31:53.580" style="s2">and then you can see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.960" end="00:31:55.290" style="s2">right you&#39;re not not just not panicking</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.580" end="00:31:58.950" style="s2">you&#39;re actually getting frosty as things</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.290" end="00:32:00.030" style="s2">get harder that&#39;s what&#39;s needed all</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.950" end="00:32:01.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s what&#39;s called for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.030" end="00:32:04.200" style="s2">what what keeps things holding together</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.680" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">and as things get even hotter it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.200" end="00:32:08.160" style="s2">more and more important so the little</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.630" style="s2">order and and the many other folks</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.160" end="00:32:11.720" style="s2">around the world who kind of discovered</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.630" end="00:32:15.060" style="s2">the responsibility of that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.720" end="00:32:18.120" style="s2">practice are actually playing a vital</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.060" end="00:32:19.740" style="s2">role in the way this thing plays out and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.120" end="00:32:21.000" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna come back to the question you</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.740" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">asked to just I just remembered sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.000" end="00:32:25.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a very important story to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:28.230" style="s2">telling here I don&#39;t know it was you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:32.220" style="s2">know came through to me gosh I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.230" end="00:32:35.940" style="s2">yesterday I actually triggered earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.220" end="00:32:43.530" style="s2">today so there&#39;s the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.940" end="00:32:46.110" style="s2">Germany 1930s why mar Germany in both</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.530" end="00:32:47.670" style="s2">cases you had a Great Depression you had</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.110" end="00:32:50.130" style="s2">a financial crisis that blew the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:32:53.010" style="s2">financial system up you had a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.130" end="00:32:55.410" style="s2">powerful economic depression that put a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.010" end="00:32:58.470" style="s2">whole lot of people out of work and with</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.410" end="00:33:01.350" style="s2">real privation starvation in bed but in</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:04.050" style="s2">the United States the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.350" end="00:33:06.210" style="s2">community the the people who are able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.050" end="00:33:08.100" style="s2">say no no this is not a an</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.210" end="00:33:10.890" style="s2">us-versus-them story this is a Wiis</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.100" end="00:33:12.600" style="s2">story and we&#39;re able to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.890" end="00:33:15.180" style="s2">to deal with the problem and come</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.600" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">together as a community was strong and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.180" end="00:33:19.530" style="s2">we had just a lot of community fabric</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:22.530" style="s2">back then and they rose to the occasion</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.530" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">and it actually became stronger as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.530" end="00:33:26.340" style="s2">consequence so of course we came out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:28.200" style="s2">the Great Depression into World War Two</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.340" end="00:33:30.909" style="s2">and out of World War two as a very</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.909" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">at the base like with footings with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.739" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">solid footing now before Germany had</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:39.999" style="s2">been handed a bad hand I World War One</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:42.129" style="s2">wreaked havoc to both her psychology and</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.950" end="00:33:53.379" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a lot of legitimacy and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.049" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">that the depression the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.379" end="00:33:57.789" style="s2">and the the economic crisis ripped right</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:04.539" style="s2">through those as well and you had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.289" end="00:34:07.090" style="s2">complete meltdown of the basic cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.539" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">fabric of Germany and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.090" end="00:34:10.569" style="s2">how you get Nazi Germany and the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">of that is also you get Venezuela right</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.569" end="00:34:14.500" style="s2">it either goes towards radical and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">thorat airiness or it goes towards chaos</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.500" end="00:34:19.329" style="s2">and those are really bad results no I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.240" end="00:34:35.109" style="s2">getting stronger as it pushes against</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.109" end="00:34:38.679" style="s2">thing this is antifragility right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.899" end="00:34:39.879" style="s2">individuals who have already made the</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.750" end="00:34:51.970" style="s2">when a it&#39;s complex and moving fast and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.299" end="00:34:53.649" style="s2">be other people are intentionally trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.970" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">to throw dense information at them and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.649" end="00:34:57.940" style="s2">they still choose that the answer is we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:34:59.529" style="s2">not us versus them and they start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.940" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">build that community fabric around them</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.529" end="00:35:03.010" style="s2">and they hold their you know they hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">their arms out and bring people under</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.010" end="00:35:05.619" style="s2">their protection and then they weave</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:07.630" style="s2">together and look at each other and say</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.619" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">okay we can take it all right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.630" end="00:35:11.160" style="s2">the moral of the story that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:14.230" style="s2">beginning in the end of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.160" end="00:35:16.420" style="s2">um now I forgot the question would</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.230" end="00:35:17.980" style="s2">you ask yeah well we were gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.420" end="00:35:19.270" style="s2">about financial crisis but you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.980" end="00:35:21.789" style="s2">come back and talk about community and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.270" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">so I think you really nailed it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.789" end="00:35:26.109" style="s2">of the ante fidelity and the we the we</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.010" end="00:35:30.339" style="s2">factor and just a commitment a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.109" end="00:35:31.960" style="s2">commitment to engaging in this way with</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.339" end="00:35:34.299" style="s2">information in the world around us and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.960" end="00:35:37.480" style="s2">the people that we have chosen to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.299" end="00:35:39.069" style="s2">commune with this this is the strength</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.480" end="00:35:41.110" style="s2">that we have and it&#39;s giving us power</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.069" end="00:35:43.390" style="s2">and it&#39;s really been</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.110" end="00:35:44.290" style="s2">markable to see everything was going</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.390" end="00:35:46.450" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.290" end="00:35:48.190" style="s2">but this Corona thing has really brought</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.450" end="00:35:49.990" style="s2">the virus that was the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.190" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve got the virus to the corona thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.990" end="00:35:53.350" style="s2">has really brought us all together but</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:55.840" style="s2">we&#39;re all are thinking about these major</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.350" end="00:35:58.750" style="s2">issues and and the financial crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.840" end="00:36:00.790" style="s2">2008 or nine was a huge hugely</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.750" end="00:36:03.220" style="s2">problematic event for the United States</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.790" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">and as you told me before you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.220" end="00:36:07.600" style="s2">the financial sector destroyed the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">economy and the economy strip-mine down</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.600" end="00:36:13.660" style="s2">into civic society in many ways do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.390" end="00:36:16.030" style="s2">but do we feel this is comparable are we</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.660" end="00:36:17.830" style="s2">facing similar risks are we faced bigger</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.030" end="00:36:21.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s big it&#39;s bigger than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.830" end="00:36:23.290" style="s2">2008 financial crisis really houses yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.340" end="00:36:25.150" style="s2">explain that because they never solved</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.290" end="00:36:27.070" style="s2">the problem in the 2008 financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:29.080" style="s2">they just get that can down the road and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.070" end="00:36:31.900" style="s2">now they can come back and kicked us so</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.080" end="00:36:33.430" style="s2">they&#39;re panicking in a big way and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.900" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">got a couple of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.430" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">going on right we&#39;ve got a big ass virus</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:39.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s happening and it&#39;s real enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:41.380" style="s2">like I don&#39;t need to sort of it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.220" end="00:36:44.530" style="s2">the flu and it&#39;s not the Black Death</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.380" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">right somewhere in between and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.530" end="00:36:48.970" style="s2">pretty straightforward that if you if</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:50.320" style="s2">you should have handled it with your</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.970" end="00:36:51.610" style="s2">with your head up and you kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.320" end="00:36:54.100" style="s2">at it it&#39;s okay we&#39;re going to just make</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.610" end="00:36:55.810" style="s2">the right choices in the right pace then</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.100" end="00:36:58.150" style="s2">you can mitigate the damage pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.810" end="00:36:59.470" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already seen a bunch of folks</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.150" end="00:37:01.720" style="s2">over in Asia to make those choices and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.470" end="00:37:07.120" style="s2">it worked out and if it looks like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.720" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">are complacent or stupid and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.120" end="00:37:09.820" style="s2">a lot of 20-year olds are stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen evidence that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.820" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">of the bigger risk factors may actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.070" end="00:37:14.920" style="s2">get real bad remember this with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:16.180" style="s2">wheat the weak point the sweet spot here</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.920" end="00:37:18.970" style="s2">at the sensitive corn is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.180" end="00:37:20.530" style="s2">overwhelming of the emergency rooms and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.970" end="00:37:22.930" style="s2">one rate one suite so it&#39;s it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.530" end="00:37:25.540" style="s2">tidal wave once we get too many of those</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.930" end="00:37:27.460" style="s2">once the the cup is filled and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:29.650" style="s2">water flowing out on the on your shoes</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.460" end="00:37:31.690" style="s2">now you actually are in real trouble the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.650" end="00:37:32.710" style="s2">mortality rates skyrockets and so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.690" end="00:37:34.270" style="s2">can look at Italy where you&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.710" end="00:37:35.860" style="s2">a five percent or a seven percent I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.270" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">think the last time I checked which is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.860" end="00:37:39.160" style="s2">real big number that&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:41.290" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good thing and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.160" end="00:37:42.610" style="s2">it&#39;s no picnic for young people if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.290" end="00:37:43.720" style="s2">get it this is not the kind of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.610" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">want to just kind of go out there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.720" end="00:37:47.740" style="s2">start licking doorknobs and see if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:49.030" style="s2">can you know show off which is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.740" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">doing actually we&#39;re still doing all</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.030" end="00:37:53.020" style="s2">right they&#39;re dumb and hopefully your</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:54.220" style="s2">choices suddenly have consequences again</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.020" end="00:37:56.060" style="s2">which is a good thing from my</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.220" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.060" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s real enough right but then you</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:03.080" style="s2">got the the financial crisis and which</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:04.580" style="s2">is super real like it&#39;s gonna be a big</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.080" end="00:38:06.080" style="s2">question and it&#39;s interested because</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.580" end="00:38:07.820" style="s2">well they didn&#39;t really fix anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.080" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">they did actually get really good at</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.820" end="00:38:12.770" style="s2">dealing fires but they didn&#39;t decide to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:15.290" style="s2">go ahead and not have fires but they got</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.770" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">really good at putting out fire and boy</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.290" end="00:38:19.970" style="s2">are they pulling out those tools these</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">days and boy is the market not impressed</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.970" end="00:38:24.500" style="s2">so right and by that you mean like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">Fed and repo actions and the Fed Funds</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.500" end="00:38:29.120" style="s2">rate at zero and yeah and would</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:30.410" style="s2">potential fiscal stimulus oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.120" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">exactly the whole kit and caboodle</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.410" end="00:38:34.790" style="s2">things that thinks the back in 2008 they</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:36.230" style="s2">had to figure out that to invent now</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.790" end="00:38:37.340" style="s2">that could just kind of push buttons now</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.230" end="00:38:38.780" style="s2">they&#39;re noticing there happened to push</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.340" end="00:38:40.730" style="s2">the buttons really really hard to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.780" end="00:38:41.960" style="s2">any effect because you know you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.730" end="00:38:45.260" style="s2">keep taking the smack if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.960" end="00:38:46.850" style="s2">keep having the feel but uh well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.260" end="00:38:48.890" style="s2">where it is but the but you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.850" end="00:38:50.630" style="s2">carrying that analogy forward a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.890" end="00:38:52.250" style="s2">bit you keep pushing the button and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.630" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">eventually you&#39;re just dead eventually</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.250" end="00:38:57.950" style="s2">do a yes got that we&#39;ve got that going</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:38:58.460" style="s2">for us that&#39;s a real thing are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.950" end="00:39:00.170" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.460" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">is there anything contemplated currently</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.170" end="00:39:04.520" style="s2">that you think is anything beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.260" style="s2">pushing that button again I mean are we</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.520" end="00:39:08.780" style="s2">kicking the can down the road again</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.260" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">oh we just do a huge financial bailout</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.780" end="00:39:12.380" style="s2">and run it negative interest rates for</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.490" end="00:39:13.610" style="s2">24 months all right let&#39;s look back to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.380" end="00:39:14.840" style="s2">that I mean I had a feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.610" end="00:39:15.830" style="s2">more fuel to the fire and then come back</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.840" end="00:39:17.660" style="s2">to that cuz I think there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.830" end="00:39:18.590" style="s2">nice pivot point there so just to make</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.660" end="00:39:19.970" style="s2">some of the difference it&#39;s difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.590" end="00:39:22.850" style="s2">between now and then so we got a virus</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.970" end="00:39:25.640" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have that bit we got China</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.850" end="00:39:28.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that then right back in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.640" end="00:39:30.680" style="s2">China is sort of the up-and-comer now</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.010" end="00:39:32.180" style="s2">China is you know pretty pretty solid</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.680" end="00:39:33.610" style="s2">bantamweight this is this who we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.180" end="00:39:36.920" style="s2">talking about a 12 year old kid anymore</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.610" end="00:39:37.940" style="s2">and they&#39;re making moves right now all</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.920" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">right they&#39;re not standing still they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.940" end="00:39:41.570" style="s2">actually looking at this same hmm looks</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">like the US may actually be looking to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.570" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">give up some territory well maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:47.510" style="s2">be happy to take it I mean obviously our</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:49.010" style="s2">friends in Russia and everywhere on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.510" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">planet unfortunately in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.010" end="00:39:53.840" style="s2">where the kind of the moral political</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.700" style="s2">and sort of de facto obvious leadership</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.840" end="00:39:57.650" style="s2">the United States is no longer so</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.700" end="00:40:01.100" style="s2">obvious everybody&#39;s kind of watching us</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.650" end="00:40:03.410" style="s2">to see if the old lions lost a step and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.100" end="00:40:05.480" style="s2">on top of that back in 2008 coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.410" end="00:40:06.320" style="s2">action across central banks and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.480" end="00:40:07.850" style="s2">governments was trivial</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.320" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">everybody got on the phone and called</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.850" end="00:40:10.520" style="s2">each other and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:12.920" style="s2">çb did this the Japanese bank did this</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.520" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">these days everybody&#39;s kind of waiting</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.920" end="00:40:16.220" style="s2">to see what&#39;s the right choice to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:18.140" style="s2">for themselves that&#39;s another difference</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.220" end="00:40:20.329" style="s2">another difference is we didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.140" end="00:40:22.520" style="s2">crypto economy and nobody was playing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.329" end="00:40:23.990" style="s2">with possibility of alternative monetary</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.520" end="00:40:25.880" style="s2">systems back then and as they are which</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.990" end="00:40:27.640" style="s2">means that we have a little bit of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.880" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">some choice you know if there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.640" end="00:40:32.450" style="s2">issue of what&#39;s the flight to safety and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:33.470" style="s2">it looks like the dollars maybe not as</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.450" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">safe as we thought it was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.470" end="00:40:36.170" style="s2">there&#39;s some other options out there</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.240" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">there&#39;s people who might actually decide</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.170" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">to do it even still other options so so</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:43.880" style="s2">far I have to say that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:45.530" style="s2">particularly impressed with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.880" end="00:40:46.790" style="s2">creativity is coming out of the top in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.530" end="00:40:48.470" style="s2">terms of the financial crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.790" end="00:40:49.880" style="s2">happening right now looks like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.470" end="00:40:50.420" style="s2">just going down to point out the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.880" end="00:40:52.609" style="s2">playbook</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.420" end="00:40:54.920" style="s2">now the PlayBook has a few more rows on</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.609" end="00:40:57.470" style="s2">it we&#39;ve got that a thing that got</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.920" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">dubbed helicopter money and I get I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:00.980" style="s2">see their finger hover it over that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">button right now and then they in fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.980" end="00:41:03.619" style="s2">need to it may be the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:04.970" style="s2">because with Mitt Romney&#39;s thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.619" end="00:41:07.010" style="s2">dollar check to just make people have</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.970" end="00:41:08.810" style="s2">cash and helicopter money are kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.010" end="00:41:11.270" style="s2">match made in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.810" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">but you know the poison is a cure that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.270" end="00:41:14.270" style="s2">may solve a couple of problems and may</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:15.319" style="s2">solve some pretty important problems it</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.270" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">all creates a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.319" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">problems down downstream so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">kicking the can down it&#39;s not the road</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:23.180" style="s2">anymore is it you&#39;re kicking the can up</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.990" style="s2">hill and it gets bigger each time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.180" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">kind of weird to sofyan problem but we</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.990" end="00:41:30.619" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have to take it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:32.119" style="s2">much anymore we don&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.619" end="00:41:34.210" style="s2">to be kind of sitting here looking up</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.119" end="00:41:36.109" style="s2">and saying please don&#39;t us again</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.210" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not a tea party issue either</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.109" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">because we can all talk to each other we</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.690" style="s2">can all coordinate and we can build</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:42.740" style="s2">stuff and we can actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.690" end="00:41:44.510" style="s2">ability to actually choose to build</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.740" end="00:41:46.339" style="s2">stuff that we like and maybe build some</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.510" end="00:41:47.930" style="s2">solutions that we prefer to see and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.339" end="00:41:50.329" style="s2">we can actually show up and say hey you</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.930" end="00:41:53.630" style="s2">know what I think maybe I ought to do B</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.329" end="00:41:55.569" style="s2">instead of a and if you don&#39;t do B we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.630" end="00:41:58.490" style="s2">gonna kind of do B anyway and off</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.569" end="00:42:00.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very different way by we</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.490" end="00:42:03.290" style="s2">you mean the people I mean the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.130" end="00:42:05.489" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a lot of that going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.290" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.489" end="00:42:10.119" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an example this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:11.769" style="s2">happening in real time and I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.119" end="00:42:14.199" style="s2">that it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s a little scary</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.769" end="00:42:17.049" style="s2">because it has it&#39;s got some potential</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.199" end="00:42:18.309" style="s2">so those at four mentioned 70 million</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.049" end="00:42:19.630" style="s2">people are gonna be an extremist in</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.309" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">about two to six weeks well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.630" end="00:42:23.709" style="s2">problems are gonna have is making merit</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:26.619" style="s2">well one of the old solutions is the old</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.709" end="00:42:28.390" style="s2">fashioned rent strike seventy million</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.619" end="00:42:30.609" style="s2">people all at once safe buck off we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.390" end="00:42:33.339" style="s2">not paying rent then they probably get</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.609" end="00:42:35.559" style="s2">away with it now there&#39;s a problem to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.339" end="00:42:37.469" style="s2">that because there&#39;s a lot of us versus</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.559" end="00:42:39.609" style="s2">them energy and that particular approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.469" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">right but there&#39;s also a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.609" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">that being a hey everybody look we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">want to go there there&#39;s a lot of better</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:45.759" style="s2">ways to solving this problem in fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">there&#39;s actually some pretty triplica</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.759" end="00:42:48.670" style="s2">trivial ways of solving the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.619" style="s2">if nobody&#39;s gonna solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.670" end="00:42:51.609" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be the ones to take a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.619" end="00:42:54.969" style="s2">hit we&#39;re gonna solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.609" end="00:42:56.499" style="s2">ourselves and you know that&#39;s it here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.969" end="00:42:58.690" style="s2">the choice it&#39;s no longer a choice of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.499" end="00:43:02.440" style="s2">what was the how did it work back in</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.690" end="00:43:05.019" style="s2">2008 it&#39;s like tells you win heads out</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.440" end="00:43:06.099" style="s2">tells you lose heads I win right yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.019" end="00:43:08.739" style="s2">no we&#39;re gonna have to go ahead ahead</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.099" end="00:43:12.190" style="s2">have a fair coin and and we&#39;ll take take</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.739" end="00:43:13.089" style="s2">our take our beds and I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.190" end="00:43:14.440" style="s2">even go further than that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.089" end="00:43:16.029" style="s2">I think we can actually start engaging</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.440" end="00:43:17.949" style="s2">those people and say you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.029" end="00:43:19.479" style="s2">hear you and I see it and it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.949" end="00:43:20.769" style="s2">and let&#39;s actually build a better design</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.479" end="00:43:22.059" style="s2">let&#39;s all work together there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.769" end="00:43:23.650" style="s2">reason for us to actually even slow down</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.059" end="00:43:25.390" style="s2">or wait we can solve these problems and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.650" end="00:43:27.489" style="s2">then flip it around the way that ought</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.390" end="00:43:30.489" style="s2">to be anyway and put the politicians in</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.489" end="00:43:31.630" style="s2">the following seat and and there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.489" end="00:43:36.249" style="s2">to be done and I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.630" end="00:43:38.739" style="s2">utilities cable that&#39;s hard I can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.249" end="00:43:40.089" style="s2">the lights turn off that is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.739" end="00:43:40.930" style="s2">serious problem we can we can work a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.089" end="00:43:42.940" style="s2">little bit on that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.930" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">solutions to it but broadly speaking we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.940" end="00:43:45.459" style="s2">need the utility companies to continue</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:48.279" style="s2">to function and continue to give people</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.459" end="00:43:51.249" style="s2">electricity so that&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.279" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">of uh let&#39;s concur ajar local mayors and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.249" end="00:43:54.549" style="s2">governors to be able to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:55.719" style="s2">clearly about what to do and we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.549" end="00:43:57.009" style="s2">support them I don&#39;t need to be this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.719" end="00:43:58.029" style="s2">isn&#39;t it be conflict well we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.009" end="00:43:59.289" style="s2">working together and all the twist</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.029" end="00:44:00.459" style="s2">makers need to be supported and getting</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.690" end="00:47:08.120" style="s2">the themes that I&#39;ve been hearing lately</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.040" end="00:47:09.800" style="s2">- is that the era I&#39;ve been pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.120" end="00:47:11.780" style="s2">one a little bit myself I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.800" end="00:47:15.710" style="s2">your thoughts the era of indiscriminate</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.780" end="00:47:18.250" style="s2">connection is ending and by that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.710" end="00:47:21.050" style="s2">you know globalization NATO expansion</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.250" end="00:47:23.000" style="s2">social media out there everybody reach</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.050" end="00:47:25.340" style="s2">put everything out there Connect connect</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.000" end="00:47:27.800" style="s2">connect and maybe now are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.340" end="00:47:31.310" style="s2">tipping towards where the smart money is</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.800" end="00:47:33.890" style="s2">on strategic disconnection and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.310" end="00:47:35.870" style="s2">that this is a theme that can be related</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.890" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">both on a personal level with social</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.870" end="00:47:41.150" style="s2">media in your communities all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:44.090" style="s2">to globalization and lack of trade</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.150" end="00:47:47.060" style="s2">barriers and capital flows and such is</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.090" end="00:47:49.820" style="s2">it do we have a trend reversal in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.060" end="00:47:52.130" style="s2">making here and if so is it wise is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.820" end="00:47:54.680" style="s2">unwise all right I just you know seeing</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.130" end="00:47:56.630" style="s2">things I think I agree with you that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.680" end="00:47:59.360" style="s2">old that old trend of indiscriminate</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.630" end="00:48:01.400" style="s2">connection is definitely do a as on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.360" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">on its way out and what I&#39;d say is as</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.400" end="00:48:09.230" style="s2">with all things there&#39;s a choice it</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:10.250" style="s2">could be bad it could be good I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.230" end="00:48:12.310" style="s2">say there&#39;s something a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.250" end="00:48:14.690" style="s2">disconnection feels a little bit angry I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.310" end="00:48:16.850" style="s2">might suggest something like discernment</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.690" end="00:48:19.550" style="s2">and right relationship oh here we go</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.850" end="00:48:20.780" style="s2">that nice yeah and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.550" end="00:48:22.190" style="s2">possibility now you have to use</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.780" end="00:48:24.230" style="s2">discernment you have to build a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.190" end="00:48:26.450" style="s2">use discernment to sense what</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.230" end="00:48:27.740" style="s2">relationships are possible and what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.450" end="00:48:30.530" style="s2">the rightness of a given relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.740" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeking and wow</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.530" end="00:48:33.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not bad that&#39;s always good right</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:35.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the exact and and and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.650" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">available and the right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.120" end="00:48:39.050" style="s2">mean might mean turn around and walk</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:40.310" style="s2">away but doesn&#39;t mean you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.050" end="00:48:43.250" style="s2">angry about it it just means that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.310" end="00:48:45.110" style="s2">right thing right now yeah so part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.250" end="00:48:46.820" style="s2">this trend would be like on</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.110" end="00:48:50.300" style="s2">showing some of our critical national</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.190" end="00:48:57.050" style="s2">like that so that we&#39;re committed mostly</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.710" end="00:48:57.830" style="s2">to taking care of ourselves self care</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.050" end="00:49:00.670" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.830" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">rather than committed to this notion of</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.410" style="s2">all the way to its natural conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.330" end="00:49:11.900" style="s2">right it&#39;s ourselves literally ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.410" end="00:49:14.030" style="s2">our physical bodies as individuals in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.900" end="00:49:16.730" style="s2">our minds and our souls and our</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:33.110" style="s2">solid foundation how do we increase our</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.440" end="00:49:35.570" style="s2">discernment because discernment is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.110" end="00:49:38.540" style="s2">key element it seems in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.570" end="00:49:40.430" style="s2">right and have we been lacking generally</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.540" end="00:49:42.320" style="s2">collectively in discernment our</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.430" end="00:49:44.690" style="s2">discernment capabilities extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.320" end="00:49:47.660" style="s2">is extraordinarily so so can you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.690" end="00:49:51.400" style="s2">why our discernment capabilities have</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.660" end="00:49:54.470" style="s2">been eroded and then how do we</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.470" end="00:49:59.600" style="s2">and a nation level increase our levels</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.050" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">of discernment and then put that into</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.600" end="00:50:06.380" style="s2">practice Jordan well first again the me</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:08.210" style="s2">say I will do my I will never my level</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.380" end="00:50:09.260" style="s2">best to share some things of value there</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.210" end="00:50:10.820" style="s2">are people who are vastly better</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.820" end="00:50:22.900" style="s2">question okay so so modest just honest</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.940" end="00:50:24.920" style="s2">let&#39;s go with integrity first okay and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.900" end="00:50:26.090" style="s2">integrity is pretty simple like think</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.920" end="00:50:28.550" style="s2">about when you&#39;re trying to build a wall</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.090" end="00:50:31.970" style="s2">with rocks or bricks does it have</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.550" end="00:50:33.500" style="s2">structural integrity do you have a solid</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.970" end="00:50:34.850" style="s2">foundation or things stacked one on top</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.500" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">of the other in the right order and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.850" end="00:50:41.080" style="s2">imbalance and that&#39;s that&#39;s integrity in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:43.430" style="s2">yourself integrity is all of you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.080" end="00:50:44.840" style="s2">connected as all of you showing up and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.430" end="00:50:47.390" style="s2">it&#39;s all about in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.840" end="00:50:49.430" style="s2">itself in a strong way again poise is an</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.390" end="00:50:50.390" style="s2">aspect of that very similar I said when</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.430" end="00:50:52.820" style="s2">I said again I was thinking about my</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.390" end="00:50:54.980" style="s2">basketball player or a dancer or a boxer</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.820" end="00:50:58.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this actually that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.980" end="00:50:58.300" style="s2">sense of being poised and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.990" end="00:51:03.010" style="s2">that sense of having capacity to connect</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.010" end="00:51:07.420" style="s2">with continuity that your future self is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.320" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">in relationship to your present self in</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.420" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">the same way that all the aspects of</p>

<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:16.390" style="s2">continuity integrity continuing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.619" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">sovereignty I ability to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.390" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">and increasingly diverse and challenging</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:25.869" style="s2">context this is like what keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:27.160" style="s2">instrument in tune now if you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.869" end="00:51:30.850" style="s2">old one of those old-fashioned TV</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.369" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">all right so it&#39;s very easily to throw</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.960" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">off a lot of the things that get thrown</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">up or on the inside you get triggered</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:52.840" style="s2">you get angry you&#39;re judgmental you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:54.790" style="s2">think you know the right answer to get</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.960" end="00:52:05.710" style="s2">with that being able to allow those</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:09.850" style="s2">things to come up and and yet at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.710" end="00:52:11.590" style="s2">same time not have them become the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.850" end="00:52:13.660" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in front of you you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.590" end="00:52:15.550" style="s2">don&#39;t want the interior view to getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.660" end="00:52:17.470" style="s2">in front of your lenses you wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.550" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">behind and that reality come through you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.470" end="00:52:24.900" style="s2">and then let your interior process that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:24.900" style="s2">and digest it and make it metabolize it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.140" end="00:52:28.680" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of things we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">want to perceive and most imposed if it</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.680" end="00:52:31.890" style="s2">is that kind of thing so discernment is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:34.440" style="s2">then first just becoming a clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.890" end="00:52:38.279" style="s2">instrument and being able to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.440" end="00:52:39.779" style="s2">clarity in as many possible constants as</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.279" end="00:52:41.099" style="s2">you can and then building your</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.779" end="00:52:42.359" style="s2">attunement right this is a real skill</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.099" end="00:52:44.849" style="s2">one of the things that really really</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.359" end="00:52:49.799" style="s2">really has harmed us a lot is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.849" end="00:52:51.809" style="s2">childhood education you know when a kid</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.799" end="00:52:53.160" style="s2">is sitting there in first grade and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.809" end="00:52:55.380" style="s2">everything around them is feeling quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.160" end="00:52:56.279" style="s2">wrong their body feels like they should</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.380" end="00:52:58.619" style="s2">be doing something else</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.279" end="00:52:59.910" style="s2">and they are required to not listen to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.619" end="00:53:01.079" style="s2">the signals coming from their body and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.910" end="00:53:04.140" style="s2">do something that is in fact I will tell</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.079" end="00:53:06.900" style="s2">you objectively obviously stupid you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.140" end="00:53:08.099" style="s2">breaking their discernment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.900" end="00:53:10.200" style="s2">breaking it you&#39;re not even betting it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.099" end="00:53:11.460" style="s2">you&#39;re just breaking it and you&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.200" end="00:53:12.690" style="s2">coding it into something else all right</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.460" end="00:53:14.609" style="s2">you&#39;re turning a human being into some</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.690" end="00:53:17.339" style="s2">kind of a machine and machines don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.609" end="00:53:18.450" style="s2">have very good discernment good ability</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.339" end="00:53:19.710" style="s2">to repeat the same thing over and over</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.450" end="00:53:21.569" style="s2">again if you&#39;re building that kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.710" end="00:53:22.980" style="s2">object you&#39;re trying to make a tool then</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.569" end="00:53:24.390" style="s2">that&#39;s you&#39;re doing a good job if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.980" end="00:53:25.349" style="s2">trying to build a human being with</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.390" end="00:53:27.450" style="s2">discernment you&#39;re doing quite a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.349" end="00:53:29.519" style="s2">disservice and it continues to build</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.450" end="00:53:31.769" style="s2">because it becomes a feedback loop right</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.519" end="00:53:33.750" style="s2">as you get out of out of connection with</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.769" end="00:53:36.029" style="s2">these signals you can very easily get</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.750" end="00:53:38.009" style="s2">out of integrity right when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.029" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">divided against yourself when one part</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.009" end="00:53:40.920" style="s2">of you definitely definitely does not</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:41.759" style="s2">believe something but another part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.920" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">you needs it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.759" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">and you sort of repressed parts of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:45.960" style="s2">yourself in order to have other parts of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:47.519" style="s2">yourself working out instead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.960" end="00:53:49.079" style="s2">mastering discernment you master</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.519" end="00:53:52.349" style="s2">repression and self delusion itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.079" end="00:53:53.789" style="s2"> and then you build it into an</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.349" end="00:53:54.809" style="s2">institutional structure where people</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.789" end="00:53:56.039" style="s2">make a whole lot of money by being</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.809" end="00:53:57.269" style="s2">really good at bringing out the P up a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.039" end="00:53:58.819" style="s2">lot of integrity and giving them stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.269" end="00:54:00.470" style="s2">they never needed in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.819" end="00:54:02.220" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.470" end="00:54:05.220" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s kind of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.220" end="00:54:08.099" style="s2">thing that we&#39;ve built but the good news</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.220" end="00:54:09.059" style="s2">is the trend is reversed and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.099" end="00:54:12.990" style="s2">heading back from the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.059" end="00:54:14.759" style="s2">discernment okay how do you say I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.990" end="00:54:16.440" style="s2">we can take this tangent if you want I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.759" end="00:54:19.799" style="s2">interested in education especially I</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.440" end="00:54:22.109" style="s2">spent 10 years turning around some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.799" end="00:54:23.670" style="s2">the underperforming charter schools in</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.109" end="00:54:27.809" style="s2">the District of Columbia I&#39;m fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.670" end="00:54:29.789" style="s2">by education running out hood and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.809" end="00:54:32.220" style="s2">you said really hit home actually that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.789" end="00:54:34.349" style="s2">were we&#39;re building tools but in doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.220" end="00:54:36.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re creating like a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.349" end="00:54:40.210" style="s2">oppression within within them</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.520" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">and you wrapped up by saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.210" end="00:54:44.830" style="s2">trend is changing I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.510" style="s2">that it&#39;s changing in our school system</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.830" end="00:54:48.100" style="s2">or in early childhood oh right so like</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.510" end="00:54:50.830" style="s2">these inputs that we&#39;re getting into our</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.100" end="00:54:52.360" style="s2">system which to speak so callously of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.830" end="00:54:55.090" style="s2">our children but you know these inputs</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.360" end="00:54:57.070" style="s2">into our system they&#39;re still coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.090" end="00:54:59.170" style="s2">with the the flaws of the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.070" end="00:55:02.050" style="s2">have existed currently right so oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.170" end="00:55:05.650" style="s2">yeah you firmer at the idea of a trim</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.050" end="00:55:06.820" style="s2">tab the trim tab I am as a Bucky fuller</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.650" end="00:55:10.270" style="s2">was talking about how when you take a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.820" end="00:55:13.120" style="s2">look at a really really big ship and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.270" end="00:55:14.350" style="s2">rudder it&#39;s huge right is pulling huge</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.120" end="00:55:15.940" style="s2">amounts while you can&#39;t turn the rudder</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.350" end="00:55:19.450" style="s2">so you don&#39;t what you do is you actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.940" end="00:55:20.680" style="s2">turn a much much smaller object all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.450" end="00:55:22.990" style="s2">way out of the end which is called a</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.680" end="00:55:24.370" style="s2">trim tab which changes the disposition</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.990" end="00:55:25.990" style="s2">of the rudder and it begins to change</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.370" end="00:55:29.650" style="s2">the fact that butter more less turn</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.990" end="00:55:30.730" style="s2">itself so the trend is changing but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.650" end="00:55:33.010" style="s2">trend is changing what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.730" end="00:55:35.080" style="s2">the most subtle ways possible like just</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.010" end="00:55:37.390" style="s2">in in the liminal order there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.080" end="00:55:39.100" style="s2">people out there hundreds right now</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.390" end="00:55:41.080" style="s2">millions who are beginning the process</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.100" end="00:55:43.150" style="s2">of grasping the reality of what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.080" end="00:55:45.820" style="s2">possible what&#39;s necessary but that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.150" end="00:55:47.260" style="s2">begins it begins things and then the old</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.820" end="00:55:49.390" style="s2">system is just getting hammered right</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.260" end="00:55:50.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a big one going on right now I</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.390" end="00:55:51.070" style="s2">just heard from my daughters that their</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.620" end="00:55:52.810" style="s2">school&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.070" end="00:55:54.090" style="s2">looking to potentially simply be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.810" end="00:55:56.620" style="s2">canceled for the rest of the school year</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.090" end="00:56:00.010" style="s2">yeah so they&#39;re having to level up on</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.620" end="00:56:01.900" style="s2">how to engage in tell education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.010" end="00:56:03.370" style="s2">just a huge opportunity it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.900" end="00:56:04.630" style="s2">terrible one they could make make a mess</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.370" end="00:56:04.990" style="s2">of it but it could also be a really good</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.630" end="00:56:07.480" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.990" end="00:56:09.010" style="s2">and what&#39;s really powerful is these kids</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.480" end="00:56:10.360" style="s2">know a hell of a lot more about how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.010" end="00:56:11.800" style="s2">do things digitally than any of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.360" end="00:56:13.960" style="s2">teachers or any of the administrators</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.800" end="00:56:15.940" style="s2">like for sure a hundred million times</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.960" end="00:56:17.380" style="s2">more like they are a powerful force and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.940" end="00:56:19.510" style="s2">they&#39;re powerful force unlike our</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.380" end="00:56:21.700" style="s2">generation which at least for me at</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.510" end="00:56:23.320" style="s2">least was was raised on a personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.700" end="00:56:25.780" style="s2">computer that was one machine that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.320" end="00:56:27.490" style="s2">dealt with are they&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.780" end="00:56:29.140" style="s2">networked continuously as a native</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.490" end="00:56:31.750" style="s2">language so to be perfectly frank I</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.140" end="00:56:33.070" style="s2">would more or less put them ask them how</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.750" end="00:56:35.350" style="s2">to solve the problem and then support</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.070" end="00:56:37.860" style="s2">them in doing it if I want if you want</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.350" end="00:56:37.860" style="s2">to go there now</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">education so in terms of discernment the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.780" end="00:56:46.260" style="s2">baseline is actually extremely easy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:48.570" style="s2">we do early childhood developments best</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.260" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">let&#39;s talk like an actual infant I</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.570" end="00:56:52.200" style="s2">actually I&#39;ll give you a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:55.020" style="s2">this is taught to me by somebody who I</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.200" end="00:56:58.080" style="s2">deeply respect when my daughter was born</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.020" end="00:57:01.710" style="s2">my youngest daughter is now 16 and a</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.080" end="00:57:03.210" style="s2">half months we did something different</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.710" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">something we did not do it&#39;s the older</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.210" end="00:57:10.710" style="s2">ones which was before anybody picked her</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:11.990" style="s2">up you would put your hands out as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.710" end="00:57:14.550" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.990" end="00:57:15.660" style="s2">and when wait and of course when she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.550" end="00:57:16.830" style="s2">really really small you might wait a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.660" end="00:57:19.620" style="s2">little while because she has no idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.830" end="00:57:23.610" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing to see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.620" end="00:57:25.590" style="s2">obvious choice on her part did she feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.610" end="00:57:27.390" style="s2">right with that you know grandma cannot</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.590" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">come in and just grab you if grandma</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.390" end="00:57:30.000" style="s2">wants to pick you up first you let you</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.130" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">decide whether or not that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.000" end="00:57:35.820" style="s2">you&#39;re into and this isn&#39;t you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">not trying to say that you&#39;re asking the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.820" end="00:57:39.510" style="s2">child to make a choice but you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:43.470" style="s2">to do is actually allow the child to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.510" end="00:57:47.940" style="s2">have the time to get a sense of their</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.470" end="00:57:49.260" style="s2">own sense right not throw them constant</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.940" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">because you know the body has all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.260" end="00:57:52.230" style="s2">of things going on and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:54.150" style="s2">constantly jerked around from one place</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.230" end="00:57:56.130" style="s2">to another and things keep happening you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.150" end="00:57:59.340" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of it so to go slow and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.130" end="00:58:02.400" style="s2">and listen and then you listen like for</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.340" end="00:58:04.350" style="s2">me like I don&#39;t know a six week old or</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.400" end="00:58:05.550" style="s2">three day old is trying to tell me in</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.350" end="00:58:06.780" style="s2">terms of whether I&#39;d they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.550" end="00:58:08.910" style="s2">picked up but I&#39;m gonna give to take the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.780" end="00:58:10.380" style="s2">time and force myself to actually build</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.910" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">my own discernment discern it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.380" end="00:58:14.310" style="s2">two-way street it&#39;s always relational</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.640" end="00:58:16.950" style="s2">always built in relationship and lo and</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.310" end="00:58:18.930" style="s2">behold my daughter very quickly learned</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.950" end="00:58:21.420" style="s2">how to very trust your own instincts</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.930" end="00:58:23.160" style="s2">unlike before more first grader was told</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.420" end="00:58:25.410" style="s2">not to trust your instincts and she gave</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.160" end="00:58:28.070" style="s2">very clear signals quite often she had</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.410" end="00:58:30.420" style="s2">no interest in a particular individual</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.070" end="00:58:32.310" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way it was you know what</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.420" end="00:58:33.390" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not gonna override her</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.310" end="00:58:34.260" style="s2">sovereign choice not to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.390" end="00:58:37.250" style="s2">relationship with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.260" end="00:58:37.250" style="s2">individual it&#39;s certainly not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.789" end="00:58:42.179" style="s2">she&#39;s gotten quite good at it here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.989" end="00:58:45.089" style="s2">interesting thing human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.179" end="00:58:47.609" style="s2">actually naturally very very good at</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.089" end="00:58:50.759" style="s2">this skill and if you allow them to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.609" end="00:58:53.489" style="s2">the space and the quiet and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.759" end="00:58:55.380" style="s2">don&#39;t put devices in front of them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.489" end="00:58:56.939" style="s2">don&#39;t jam their sensory you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.380" end="00:59:00.900" style="s2">overload their sensorium with things are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.939" end="00:59:02.699" style="s2">not prepared for you keep the home</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.900" end="00:59:04.289" style="s2">environment pretty quiet children will</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.699" end="00:59:05.549" style="s2">begin to fill those holes and then all</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.289" end="00:59:07.829" style="s2">you got to do is listen really closely</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.549" end="00:59:09.179" style="s2">and support them and then you bring the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.829" end="00:59:10.199" style="s2">opportunity to ask questions you put</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.179" end="00:59:12.299" style="s2">them in context where they have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.199" end="00:59:13.679" style="s2">opportunity to discover epiphany and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.299" end="00:59:16.919" style="s2">then become aware of what epiphany feels</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.679" end="00:59:18.749" style="s2">like and and this is maybe the last</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.919" end="00:59:20.929" style="s2">piece on this remember we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.749" end="00:59:23.400" style="s2">how in the age of broadcast television</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.929" end="00:59:25.559" style="s2">they had to sort of do one size fits</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.400" end="00:59:27.959" style="s2">nobody and education is kind of had to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.559" end="00:59:29.369" style="s2">do the same thing yeah particularly when</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.959" end="00:59:30.779" style="s2">teachers got radically disempowered and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.369" end="00:59:34.799" style="s2">just had it going to teach to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.779" end="00:59:37.529" style="s2">program one gigantic huge and completely</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.799" end="00:59:39.900" style="s2">maladjusted curriculum that maybe works</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.529" end="00:59:41.009" style="s2">for 8 kids in the entire country all</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.900" end="00:59:42.809" style="s2">right well now is we don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.009" end="00:59:46.939" style="s2">that in principle you could create any</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.809" end="00:59:46.939" style="s2">absolutely bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.240" end="00:59:52.790" style="s2">learning environment for every single</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.180" end="00:59:54.710" style="s2">individual in principle we absolutely as</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.790" end="00:59:57.500" style="s2">a civilization could do it from birth</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.710" end="00:59:58.760" style="s2">effect before birth at the moment of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.500" end="01:00:00.890" style="s2">conception you could begin the process</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.760" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">of dealing with that individual is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.890" end="01:00:04.520" style="s2">singular event in the universe and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:06.140" style="s2">giving them the resources they need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.520" end="01:00:08.450" style="s2">become precisely who they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.140" end="01:00:10.460" style="s2">becoming this is absolutely possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.450" end="01:00:12.320" style="s2">right now in the civilization that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.460" end="01:00:14.990" style="s2">live in and the returns on that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.320" end="01:00:16.520" style="s2">infinite well no in fact they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.990" end="01:00:20.750" style="s2">actually infinite in the true meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.520" end="01:00:23.330" style="s2">the term right what&#39;s interesting is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.750" end="01:00:25.910" style="s2">school system seems to be trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.330" end="01:00:28.760" style="s2">solve for scale right like we have so</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.910" end="01:00:31.610" style="s2">many people so we have to you know put</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.760" end="01:00:33.230" style="s2">the most basic thing out there to try to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.610" end="01:00:34.700" style="s2">hit the common denominator right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.230" end="01:00:35.780" style="s2">most common denominator for people and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.700" end="01:00:38.780" style="s2">you&#39;re saying effectively we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.780" end="01:00:41.930" style="s2">hitting that at all it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.780" end="01:00:44.210" style="s2">me this fits with my general you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.930" end="01:00:46.550" style="s2">trend thesis about indiscriminate</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.210" end="01:00:49.340" style="s2">connectivity and sort of yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.550" end="01:00:51.950" style="s2">disengagement is that we&#39;d no longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.340" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">need as you&#39;re saying to engage in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.950" end="01:00:56.680" style="s2">one size fits nobody system that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:59.480" style="s2">were talking about which is really about</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.680" end="01:01:01.580" style="s2">maximizing connectivity across the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.480" end="01:01:03.650" style="s2">country in the frame of the federal</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.580" end="01:01:05.930" style="s2">federal government and their their ideas</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.650" end="01:01:07.430" style="s2">for education and now you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.930" end="01:01:11.210" style="s2">about creating a bespoke learning</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.430" end="01:01:12.950" style="s2">environment that is really only possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.210" end="01:01:14.359" style="s2">because of the technology and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.950" end="01:01:16.910" style="s2">information systems that we have today</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.359" end="01:01:19.460" style="s2">right so it&#39;s an interesting way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.910" end="01:01:21.290" style="s2">the technologies has led us at first to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.460" end="01:01:24.609" style="s2">be out there everywhere with everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.290" end="01:01:26.810" style="s2">but now can lead us into smaller</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.609" end="01:01:28.670" style="s2">completely individualized customized</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.810" end="01:01:30.830" style="s2">experience as people from conception as</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.670" end="01:01:33.650" style="s2">you say Jordan yeah it&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.830" end="01:01:35.090" style="s2">and and I mean this in quite seriously</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.650" end="01:01:36.320" style="s2">because if you think about the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.090" end="01:01:38.630" style="s2">ask the question well how could you pull</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.320" end="01:01:40.280" style="s2">that off that&#39;s a lot of time it is and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.630" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">the only people who are gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.280" end="01:01:44.570" style="s2">pull it off for parents all right well</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:45.590" style="s2">to make this thing work you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.570" end="01:01:46.940" style="s2">have to actually create space for</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.590" end="01:01:48.680" style="s2">parents to do their job which is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.940" end="01:01:50.840" style="s2">parent and you have to empower the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.680" end="01:01:52.849" style="s2">parents to actually be parents but we</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.840" end="01:01:55.430" style="s2">could do it I</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.849" end="01:01:56.900" style="s2">first and you can do it and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.430" end="01:01:59.720" style="s2">resources are available and we have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.900" end="01:02:01.430" style="s2">capacity and every done this right as</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.720" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">soon as somebody chooses to start taking</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.430" end="01:02:04.579" style="s2">responsibility for themselves the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:08.569" style="s2">possibilities that live within them are</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.579" end="01:02:10.789" style="s2">enormous indeed indeed I feel like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.569" end="01:02:13.789" style="s2">opportunity I just said opportunity not</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.789" end="01:02:15.589" style="s2">crisis this crisis is creating a million</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.789" end="01:02:17.539" style="s2">opportunities we&#39;re about to see what</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.589" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">it&#39;s like when the entire country is</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.539" end="01:02:20.839" style="s2">homeschooling</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.319" end="01:02:22.700" style="s2">first of all right exactly every but</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.839" end="01:02:25.309" style="s2">everybody is at home with their kids</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.700" end="01:02:26.690" style="s2">during the days five five days a week at</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.309" end="01:02:29.059" style="s2">least for a couple weeks it could even</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.690" end="01:02:31.460" style="s2">be a lot longer than that yeah some</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.059" end="01:02:34.549" style="s2">places have already closed schools til</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.460" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">the end of April so I can&#39;t see schools</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.549" end="01:02:39.009" style="s2">opening up early compared to the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:41.210" style="s2">schools so this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.009" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">disruption that has created an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.210" end="01:02:44.900" style="s2">opportunity and an experience a</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.130" style="s2">collective experience that we&#39;ve we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.900" end="01:02:47.720" style="s2">not ever had</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.130" end="01:02:49.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t has there ever been a time where</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.720" end="01:02:51.470" style="s2">virtually every child is at home with</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.970" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">their parents for extended time where</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.470" end="01:02:54.920" style="s2">they&#39;re ordinarily supposed to be at</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.630" style="s2">squabbling summaries of human</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.920" end="01:02:59.089" style="s2">civilization up until the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.630" end="01:03:02.690" style="s2">but but not another environment no right</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.089" end="01:03:05.299" style="s2">right exactly um what what other we</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.690" end="01:03:06.410" style="s2">talked about another opportunity you</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.299" end="01:03:09.140" style="s2">said coming out of this which would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.410" end="01:03:11.390" style="s2">like looking at new peer-to-peer mutual</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.140" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">credit systems other financial solutions</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.390" end="01:03:15.410" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing now there could be an</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">opportunity for new education systems or</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.410" end="01:03:18.650" style="s2">at least a new perspective or at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:21.650" style="s2">having the door cracked open into</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.650" end="01:03:23.150" style="s2">parents Minds that hey maybe when I see</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.650" end="01:03:24.769" style="s2">I can homeschool my kid in 90 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.150" end="01:03:26.210" style="s2">and they learn more than they were there</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.769" end="01:03:28.130" style="s2">all day long and we have all this other</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.210" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">time to do all those other stuff this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.130" end="01:03:33.529" style="s2">gonna creep into people&#39;s mindsets and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">it could lead to long term changes and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.529" end="01:03:37.219" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m seeing it already just in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:39.640" style="s2">terms of people&#39;s attitudes towards home</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.219" end="01:03:43.130" style="s2">schooling do you see any other</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.640" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">opportunities trend changes that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.130" end="01:03:46.999" style="s2">coming out of this crisis slash</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:48.289" style="s2">opportunity that we may not have talked</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.999" end="01:03:49.700" style="s2">about you know it occurs to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.289" end="01:03:53.749" style="s2">probably a really good Greek word let me</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.700" end="01:03:56.509" style="s2">give me a second here all right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.749" end="01:03:58.849" style="s2">Google in things now all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.509" end="01:04:01.460" style="s2">called Kairos you&#39;re gonna use the word</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.849" end="01:04:04.609" style="s2">Kairos it&#39;s neither a crisis nor an</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.460" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">opportunity it is a Kairos and this term</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.609" end="01:04:10.450" style="s2">is from</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:13.420" style="s2">Griese sorry I lost the taps I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.450" end="01:04:14.770" style="s2">to find you yeah I have so many tabs</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.420" end="01:04:16.180" style="s2">open now I&#39;ve never had somebody tabs</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.770" end="01:04:19.840" style="s2">I&#39;ve been wondering my computer hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.180" end="01:04:22.660" style="s2">gone up this is a moment mad a Kairos is</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.840" end="01:04:25.390" style="s2">a moment it&#39;s a moment where everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.660" end="01:04:28.750" style="s2">is is rich with possibility and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.390" end="01:04:31.420" style="s2">moment where what did this was the epic</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.750" end="01:04:33.010" style="s2">Greek language where kingdoms are won</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.420" end="01:04:37.210" style="s2">and loss and a single toss of the dice</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.010" end="01:04:38.980" style="s2">we were in a Kairos and choice</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.210" end="01:04:41.620" style="s2">our capacity to make effective choices</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.980" end="01:04:43.300" style="s2">is the beginning the end of it so what</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.620" end="01:04:44.710" style="s2">kind of possibilities arise well the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.300" end="01:04:46.180" style="s2">perfectly frankly we don&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.710" end="01:04:47.590" style="s2">because the bigger the bigger the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.180" end="01:04:49.000" style="s2">momentum but bigger the possibility I</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.590" end="01:04:51.370" style="s2">was using a metaphor described this</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.000" end="01:04:55.170" style="s2">earlier so think about the world we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.370" end="01:04:59.350" style="s2">been living in is like a like a like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.170" end="01:05:03.400" style="s2">steel ball and it&#39;s rolling on a table</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.350" end="01:05:05.050" style="s2">and the table has a big groove in it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.400" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">the ball is rolling in the groove it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.050" end="01:05:07.720" style="s2">just gonna follow that groove I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:09.100" style="s2">move the ball out of the groove you push</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.720" end="01:05:11.050" style="s2">it really hard it kind of climbs up the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.100" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">side of the group drops back in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.050" end="01:05:15.660" style="s2">like trying to change the education</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:15.660" style="s2">system in the 80s and 90s but</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.349" end="01:05:24.549" style="s2">Kairos makes the groove shallower and</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.130" end="01:05:26.049" style="s2">shallower and shallower at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.549" end="01:05:27.849" style="s2">point if the groove turns into a</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.049" end="01:05:29.710" style="s2">completely smooth surface then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.849" end="01:05:31.499" style="s2">got this big steel ball riding on a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.710" end="01:05:34.420" style="s2">glass table with no groove at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.499" end="01:05:38.519" style="s2">everything is possible and that might</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.420" end="01:05:40.809" style="s2">happen as our capacity increases</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.519" end="01:05:43.420" style="s2">remember the possibility that lives</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.809" end="01:05:44.859" style="s2">right now in individual human beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.420" end="01:05:46.029" style="s2">stepping into their sovereignty into</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.859" end="01:05:47.650" style="s2">their discernment and then coming into</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.029" end="01:05:49.930" style="s2">right relationship with each other using</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.650" end="01:05:52.359" style="s2">these new network technologies and</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.930" end="01:05:55.890" style="s2">information technology capabilities the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.359" end="01:05:55.890" style="s2">possibility space of that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.310" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">possibly millions of times larger than</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.100" end="01:06:01.830" style="s2">the world we&#39;ve been living in I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:04.050" style="s2">kidding</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.830" end="01:06:06.060" style="s2">like the mathematical orders and orders</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.050" end="01:06:08.070" style="s2">of magnitude more possibility we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.060" end="01:06:09.630" style="s2">even conceive of it the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.070" end="01:06:14.760" style="s2">that&#39;s available this lateness sitting</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.630" end="01:06:16.950" style="s2">unused right now and so as the Kairos</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.760" end="01:06:19.740" style="s2">Rises our capabilities begin to build</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.950" end="01:06:23.880" style="s2">and as the Kairos becomes more intense</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.740" end="01:06:25.890" style="s2">our necessity mother of invention forces</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.880" end="01:06:27.810" style="s2">us to step out of bad habits and old</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.890" end="01:06:28.980" style="s2">habits and drop old institutions and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.810" end="01:06:30.750" style="s2">things they&#39;ve been holding us back and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.980" end="01:06:32.610" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t make it maybe we do but</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.750" end="01:06:34.560" style="s2">if we do we&#39;ve stepped into more</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.610" end="01:06:36.750" style="s2">capacity and at a certain point that</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.560" end="01:06:37.860" style="s2">capacity begins to lift off they</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.750" end="01:06:40.080" style="s2">actually begin to look around and say</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.860" end="01:06:41.430" style="s2">wow we are actually on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.080" end="01:06:45.870" style="s2">something we&#39;re in an entirely new place</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.430" end="01:06:47.790" style="s2">and at this point it becomes like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.870" end="01:06:52.680" style="s2">science fiction novel or perhaps like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.790" end="01:06:54.450" style="s2">religious story because it&#39;s real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.680" end="01:06:55.620" style="s2">there the possibility is quite simply</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.450" end="01:06:58.230" style="s2">there now I don&#39;t know what the ending</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.620" end="01:07:03.540" style="s2">is I don&#39;t know what we are truly</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.230" end="01:07:05.130" style="s2">capable of but I have tremendous right</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.540" end="01:07:07.710" style="s2">and I know that one of your goals is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.130" end="01:07:09.300" style="s2">design for emergence right like what</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.710" end="01:07:12.420" style="s2">we&#39;re working on right now is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.300" end="01:07:14.490" style="s2">create systems that will allow for these</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.420" end="01:07:17.010" style="s2">new ideas to bubble up to the surface</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.490" end="01:07:18.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very interesting approach</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.010" end="01:07:22.320" style="s2">that you&#39;re taking which is I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.840" end="01:07:24.510" style="s2">the answer but I am working on a system</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.320" end="01:07:27.270" style="s2">that hopefully will at one point</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.510" end="01:07:28.830" style="s2">generate the quote-unquote answer yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.270" end="01:07:30.840" style="s2">that&#39;s right none of us had the answer</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.830" end="01:07:33.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not how this game works right</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.840" end="01:07:35.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a decentralized agency I think you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.630" end="01:07:37.530" style="s2">were talking about as well - and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.190" end="01:07:39.900" style="s2">also thinking one thing I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.530" end="01:07:41.160" style="s2">struck by through all this as you</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.900" end="01:07:43.290" style="s2">describe all these people putting</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.160" end="01:07:45.060" style="s2">together websites and and curate and</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.290" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">creation is a huge topic we could get</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.060" end="01:07:49.560" style="s2">into as well creating all this new</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:52.050" style="s2">information doing the analysis all this</p>

<p begin="01:12:58.059" end="01:13:03.069" style="s2">it really was and if we can find a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.800" end="01:13:05.109" style="s2">to coordinate this and just and draw it</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.069" end="01:13:07.300" style="s2">out of people on a much larger scale</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.760" end="01:14:14.019" style="s2">might want to leave us with because I I</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.739" end="01:14:15.879" style="s2">feel like this is I&#39;m in a good place</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.019" end="01:14:18.099" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling really centered actually now</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.879" end="01:14:20.139" style="s2">whereas the last few weeks have been the</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.099" end="01:14:23.709" style="s2">last few days for sure have been just</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.139" end="01:14:25.209" style="s2">madness yeah I&#39;m actually feeling pretty</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.709" end="01:14:28.719" style="s2">sent at you I mean we could go on</p>

<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:34.179" style="s2">that&#39;s it this is a very weird feeling</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.489" end="01:14:36.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s a feeling where I tell my</p>

<p begin="01:14:36.550" end="01:14:40.780" style="s2">walking in the ocean you can see the way</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.050" end="01:14:42.699" style="s2">of coming and it hasn&#39;t hit yeah but you</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.780" end="01:14:45.470" style="s2">can see it and when it hits you you</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.699" end="01:14:46.580" style="s2">could feel it and this</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.470" end="01:14:48.410" style="s2">since it doesn&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.580" end="01:14:50.660" style="s2">characteristics you had these little</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.410" end="01:14:52.460" style="s2">moments where things pop through we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.660" end="01:14:53.810" style="s2">like oh wow the grocery store shells are</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.460" end="01:14:55.310" style="s2">in fact stripped bare which is something</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.810" end="01:14:58.010" style="s2">happens like something in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.310" end="01:14:59.750" style="s2">physical happen</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.010" end="01:15:01.820" style="s2">but this wave is coming there is a wave</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.750" end="01:15:03.770" style="s2">that is coming there&#39;s an exponentially</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.820" end="01:15:06.320" style="s2">expanding virus that is coming there is</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.770" end="01:15:07.850" style="s2">a fiscal crisis that is coming but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.320" end="01:15:11.270" style="s2">not the kind of thing that we&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.850" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">feeling and that&#39;s but that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.270" end="01:15:15.350" style="s2">disorienting it&#39;s a bizarre feeling from</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:17.210" style="s2">my experience I can find myself in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.350" end="01:15:19.910" style="s2">thick of it like going I think I did 10</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.210" end="01:15:21.200" style="s2">hours straight I&#39;ve just one call after</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.910" end="01:15:23.870" style="s2">another call after another after another</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.200" end="01:15:25.460" style="s2">call and then I took off my shoes and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.870" end="01:15:28.310" style="s2">took my 16 month old daughter and walked</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.460" end="01:15:30.180" style="s2">in the spring flowers and there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.310" end="01:15:32.160" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.180" end="01:15:34.410" style="s2">like whoa I don&#39;t even work what is</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.160" end="01:15:35.940" style="s2">going on like what world am I in right</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.410" end="01:15:38.280" style="s2">now how does this happen how is it</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.940" end="01:15:46.680" style="s2">possible that simultaneously we can be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.280" end="01:15:48.690" style="s2">war and peace but yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.680" end="01:15:50.220" style="s2">that&#39;s where we are that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.690" end="01:15:52.410" style="s2">we&#39;re simultaneously a war in at peace</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.220" end="01:15:54.420" style="s2">and and I was gonna ask actually on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.410" end="01:15:58.620" style="s2">way out like what are you doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.420" end="01:16:01.830" style="s2">personally as a way to deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.620" end="01:16:04.110" style="s2">chaos around us right now but I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.830" end="01:16:06.470" style="s2">you summed it up best with that take</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.110" end="01:16:09.000" style="s2">some time with your family get outside</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.470" end="01:16:09.510" style="s2">put your feet in the grass look at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.000" end="01:16:11.820" style="s2">sky</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.510" end="01:16:14.190" style="s2">smell the flowers re-engage with nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.820" end="01:16:16.890" style="s2">find that peace that is actually right</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.190" end="01:16:19.680" style="s2">there at home with you even though all</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.890" end="01:16:23.040" style="s2">around the world everywhere right now</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.680" end="01:16:24.450" style="s2">total chaos madness yeah but but you</p>
