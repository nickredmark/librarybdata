<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:17.490" style="s2">say yes to them and we also have to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">no to them so that they do not become</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.490" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">what&#39;s pathetically us of who we are so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">that they&#39;re not extensions of who we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">are because there&#39;s no point in</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">the devil and is and that&#39;s this you</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">know in a sense there&#39;s a term from</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">hurdling chelonian sobriety there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">certain distance to how we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">these things as long as they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">becoming us then the relationship of of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">master/slave is turned on its head they</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:53.630" style="s2">just become what they could be which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:59.780" style="s2">a tool right but not as they are now</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.630" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">incredibly invasive and all all in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.780" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">surrounding and seemingly powerful and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">think that&#39;s and Heidegger also says</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">what would what is happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:13.400" style="s2">is a you know uprooting and upheaval</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:16.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the history</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.400" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">for our time for the maybe the decades</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:22.430" style="s2">to come and it&#39;s probably getting a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:29.689" style="s2">first think I don&#39;t know but but within</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.430" end="00:02:33.109" style="s2">that epochal change or currents there</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.689" end="00:02:38.329" style="s2">will be there is a need for for people</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.109" end="00:02:40.340" style="s2">to come about who can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.329" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">technology in a way that it that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.340" end="00:02:47.019" style="s2">a a reground it becomes possible right</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:49.010" style="s2">right so I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.019" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">responsibility when responsive I like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.010" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">the English word responsibility because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:56.690" style="s2">it because the because it comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">verb to respond yes then responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.690" end="00:03:02.030" style="s2">we always respond to a to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:03.739" style="s2">that&#39;s challenging yeah and let actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.030" end="00:03:05.239" style="s2">demand something of us and even if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.739" end="00:03:07.430" style="s2">don&#39;t respond then we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.239" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">responding right that&#39;s not not not</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.430" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">being responsible is a response yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s going on so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:21.889" style="s2">probably you know I&#39;d rather have I you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">and me and others using technology than</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.889" end="00:03:27.319" style="s2">only Silicon Valley types who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:29.900" style="s2">think too much about it right them to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.319" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">think about it right and yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.900" end="00:03:35.959" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t probably become entertain I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">would just not to tell you what to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.959" end="00:03:40.730" style="s2">but if it I mean not maybe as</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:43.159" style="s2">entertainment but do you do it with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.730" end="00:03:46.269" style="s2">others and do you do you have circling</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.159" end="00:03:46.269" style="s2">sessions online with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">yes yes there&#39;s other there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:57.520" style="s2">organizations that have done that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:04:00.850" style="s2">more but we are we&#39;re looking at going</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.520" end="00:04:03.670" style="s2">more more online in experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.850" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">it there is the thing I add the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.670" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">that what one of the things I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">about right is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.450" end="00:04:17.000" style="s2">if I look at like there&#39;s there&#39;s ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.709" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">in which there&#39;s like the little</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.000" end="00:04:25.730" style="s2">openings like with YouTube right that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:28.700" style="s2">think are really interesting and in its</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.730" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like when technology because most</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.700" end="00:04:36.590" style="s2">of the time technology in its in its you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:39.310" style="s2">know in its mania when something comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.590" end="00:04:41.960" style="s2">out it&#39;s already by the time you get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.310" end="00:04:45.889" style="s2">it&#39;s already just leading to the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.960" end="00:04:49.790" style="s2">next technological thing it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.889" end="00:04:52.520" style="s2">a it&#39;s a mania right but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.790" end="00:04:54.260" style="s2">there&#39;s certain pockets of YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.520" end="00:04:55.220" style="s2">what which is what we&#39;re kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.260" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">certain sense we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.220" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">we&#39;re technology actually like brought</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:07.250" style="s2">up these kind of long-form conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">great which which you get to cut it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.250" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:13.779" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:16.629" style="s2">one there&#39;s there&#39;s people having just</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.779" end="00:05:20.649" style="s2">dialogues and conversations that meander</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.629" end="00:05:22.149" style="s2">for hours right that that become present</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.649" end="00:05:27.729" style="s2">so it&#39;s like I think there&#39;s ways in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.149" end="00:05:30.759" style="s2">which like technology created brought</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.729" end="00:05:33.729" style="s2">presence right conversations between</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.759" end="00:05:36.279" style="s2">people that were like the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.729" end="00:05:38.229" style="s2">technology right which actually takes</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.279" end="00:05:40.439" style="s2">something to kind of like listen to and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.229" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">you got to kind of struggle with it um</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.439" end="00:05:46.659" style="s2">that&#39;s the part when I look at my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:51.399" style="s2">phenomenological experience I notice</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.659" end="00:05:54.719" style="s2">that I actually um you know like with</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.399" end="00:05:58.029" style="s2">your videos right there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.719" end="00:06:03.969" style="s2">there&#39;s a dialogue I&#39;ve been having with</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.029" end="00:06:05.679" style="s2">you all the time right there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.969" end="00:06:08.199" style="s2">listening to it but but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.679" end="00:06:09.909" style="s2">kind of the next video that you come out</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.199" end="00:06:13.779" style="s2">with in our next conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.909" end="00:06:16.209" style="s2">there&#39;s this anticipation of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.779" end="00:06:17.769" style="s2">past video there&#39;s a there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.209" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">kind it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve been noticing</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.769" end="00:06:23.410" style="s2">that like I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:27.220" style="s2">I have people that I dialogue with in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.410" end="00:06:29.410" style="s2">mind when I go for walks and write that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.220" end="00:06:31.290" style="s2">and I&#39;m anticipating the next video and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.410" end="00:06:37.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like adding to the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.290" end="00:06:40.840" style="s2">that now did I don&#39;t think I would have</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.030" end="00:06:45.060" style="s2">without like the YouTube right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.840" end="00:06:48.810" style="s2">think I would have that in that way so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.060" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">one of the things I take solace in is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.810" end="00:06:54.970" style="s2">I think that seems to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:56.770" style="s2">measures is like where if technology can</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.970" end="00:07:00.370" style="s2">bring something that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.770" end="00:07:06.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t in frame the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:09.310" style="s2">it brings yeah but it discloses</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.280" end="00:07:11.710" style="s2">something else right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.310" end="00:07:16.500" style="s2">I think a lot to do with this this this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.710" end="00:07:20.410" style="s2">whole thing about like cuz I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.500" end="00:07:23.200" style="s2">ya dialoguing right seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.410" end="00:07:27.340" style="s2">opposite of technology right and some</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.200" end="00:07:31.150" style="s2">respect it there is there is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.340" end="00:07:37.090" style="s2">there&#39;s also about about video or audio</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.150" end="00:07:39.970" style="s2">in general it&#39;s all listening is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.090" end="00:07:41.950" style="s2">close to us probably closer than just</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.970" end="00:07:44.380" style="s2">seeing and these videos that people talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.950" end="00:07:46.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not about the video actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.380" end="00:07:50.950" style="s2">actually about people right birthing and</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.139" end="00:08:59.949" style="s2">went to see my grandparents the villages</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.829" end="00:09:02.500" style="s2">usually they were empty on a one with</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.949" end="00:09:05.529" style="s2">children run playing outside this is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.500" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">the 90s of 80s they were to sit there</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.529" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">watching TV</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:11.079" style="s2">hey I said that that was closer to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:15.430" style="s2">than what was outside and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.079" end="00:09:17.829" style="s2">the strangeness of non Big D distancing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.430" end="00:09:20.529" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in technologies but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.829" end="00:09:23.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not to demonize it again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.529" end="00:09:26.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of again</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.110" end="00:09:28.779" style="s2">responsibilities and how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.079" end="00:09:32.170" style="s2">it and what&#39;s being given but then</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.779" end="00:09:35.800" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now is in hiding gates</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.170" end="00:09:37.629" style="s2">are hiding for example he did record his</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.800" end="00:09:41.019" style="s2">conversations he had conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.629" end="00:09:43.449" style="s2">Buddhist monk he gave he views that for</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.019" end="00:09:48.459" style="s2">we had visa was a documentary filmmaker</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.449" end="00:09:53.230" style="s2">for example and he recorded two hurdling</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.459" end="00:09:55.029" style="s2">set columns so he wasn&#39;t deposited I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.230" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">think what he says in that four texts as</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.029" end="00:10:00.250" style="s2">well as said we need to it actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">invites us because he mentioned presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.250" end="00:10:04.779" style="s2">actually invites us to really listen and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:06.939" style="s2">then you&#39;re in dialogue with someone as</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.779" end="00:10:09.939" style="s2">he said you you go outside you take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.939" end="00:10:12.069" style="s2">walk with you maybe listen to something</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.939" end="00:10:14.139" style="s2">I said or someone else has said</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.069" end="00:10:18.879" style="s2">somewhere and then you think about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.139" end="00:10:21.850" style="s2">could be what could be the next how does</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.879" end="00:10:24.189" style="s2">this fit into what I try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.850" end="00:10:26.829" style="s2">but then you then were really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.189" end="00:10:29.350" style="s2">about them are really listening and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.829" end="00:10:33.189" style="s2">it so it&#39;s not distraction it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.350" end="00:10:34.540" style="s2">the opposite yeah right so well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.189" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.540" end="00:10:41.730" style="s2">perhaps it wasn&#39;t and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.180" end="00:10:44.139" style="s2">know YouTube and other channels are</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.730" end="00:10:45.790" style="s2">fascinating in a sense because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.139" end="00:10:47.650" style="s2">not you&#39;re not being told</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.790" end="00:10:50.860" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.650" end="00:10:52.510" style="s2">no no one&#39;s stopping anyone to to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.860" end="00:10:54.220" style="s2">their own videos and try and make sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.510" end="00:10:55.810" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">know there&#39;s a bit of a cacophony it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.810" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">it&#39;s everyone can say just about</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.410" style="s2">anything and that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.380" end="00:11:04.029" style="s2">problematic too but that&#39;s it&#39;s layers</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.410" end="00:11:07.330" style="s2">to that to get to the heart of it I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.029" end="00:11:11.550" style="s2">think ultimately it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.330" end="00:11:11.550" style="s2">I know maybe you know I&#39;m Justin Murphy</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.089" end="00:11:17.830" style="s2">was it yeah he&#39;s a young academic he</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.100" end="00:11:22.089" style="s2">just left academia because he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.830" end="00:11:24.670" style="s2">wanted to remain in that and he Justin</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.089" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">made a bit more of a delusion he said in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.670" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">a recent video that you know ask there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">a certain collapse of meaning taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:34.029" style="s2">place or a meaning crisis is that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">guy that you did interviewed you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.029" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">3-hour interview yeah that&#39;s him yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:40.570" style="s2">yeah totally that&#39;s why that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:42.940" style="s2">find out about you then I would call</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.570" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">okay good you know I wouldn&#39;t so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.940" end="00:11:47.740" style="s2">could say nihilism or collapse with</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:51.730" style="s2">meeting or meeting crisis right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.740" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s happening in it a quart</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.730" end="00:11:58.360" style="s2">what would he thinks is on the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:12:01.270" style="s2">is that and I would not I will rephrase</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.360" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">it because I don&#39;t agree with the way he</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.270" end="00:12:04.690" style="s2">phrases it because he speaks with IQ</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:05.860" style="s2">levels and I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.690" end="00:12:09.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.860" end="00:12:12.339" style="s2">real or anything he says such as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.160" end="00:12:16.600" style="s2">know people who lost and say maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.339" end="00:12:18.580" style="s2">open to trying to make sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.600" end="00:12:22.060" style="s2">going on and finding meaning in a way</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.580" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s more of a you know in a very high</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.060" end="00:12:28.900" style="s2">category in terms the receivership and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:34.180" style="s2">then in a capacity to be a medium do -</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.900" end="00:12:37.950" style="s2">re rephrase it and then respect and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.180" end="00:12:40.450" style="s2">City to be a medium yes I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.950" end="00:12:43.810" style="s2">okay so like I think that&#39;s what my</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.450" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">nigga means by you know city like a I</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.810" end="00:12:51.730" style="s2">guess a psychological or psychological</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:53.800" style="s2">way would be you know the high IQ people</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.730" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">aren&#39;t more intelligent there but they</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.800" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">can make snow so one who for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:01.950" style="s2">reason is more I&#39;m in a receiver</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">not because there&#39;s anything special</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.950" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">about them but maybe there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:08.820" style="s2">suffering but something it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:11.220" style="s2">not not the greatest thing right you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.820" end="00:13:14.490" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and then also having to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.220" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">being able to articulate something</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.490" end="00:13:19.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s trying to carve out some</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:26.490" style="s2">meaning from something</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.650" end="00:13:30.180" style="s2">anyways that that would sort of in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.490" end="00:13:33.780" style="s2">that you know medium capacity or task of</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.180" end="00:13:35.240" style="s2">being a medium that there is justin puts</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.780" end="00:13:38.400" style="s2">it differently but he says basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.240" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">those more capable of doing it they will</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.400" end="00:13:45.210" style="s2">become meaning makers for the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:47.370" style="s2">decades and that&#39;s something that to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.210" end="00:13:51.300" style="s2">certain degree I think also is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.370" end="00:13:53.730" style="s2">I guess institutions are probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:57.480" style="s2">crumbling and politically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.730" end="00:14:00.510" style="s2">everything&#39;s a bit of a nightmare and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.480" end="00:14:01.830" style="s2">it in and then of course there&#39;s meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.510" end="00:14:03.720" style="s2">crisis every this is why people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.830" end="00:14:07.380" style="s2">flocking to people like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.720" end="00:14:08.820" style="s2">and others because TP provides with you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.380" end="00:14:13.830" style="s2">know meaning to a certain degree and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.820" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">talks about archetypes etc which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.830" end="00:14:18.930" style="s2">something that you&#39;re not confronted</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.110" end="00:15:15.399" style="s2">yes this he&#39;s very difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.029" end="00:15:19.540" style="s2">he&#39;s written so much he sees so much but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.399" end="00:15:23.050" style="s2">to a certain degree I think there is in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.540" end="00:15:24.490" style="s2">heilige selasa fee this possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.050" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">find a relationship with technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.490" end="00:15:32.649" style="s2">that&#39;s less destructive than it maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">now or can still become right um and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.649" end="00:15:36.130" style="s2">other thing because he mentioned he</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:40.270" style="s2">basically grew up in the 17th century he</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.130" end="00:15:43.060" style="s2">was as you know born in 80 I think 1889</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.270" end="00:15:46.930" style="s2">late 19th century but it&#39;s true that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.060" end="00:15:49.660" style="s2">Mexico there wasn&#39;t any there were in</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.930" end="00:15:52.420" style="s2">machines or anything it was farmland it</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.660" end="00:15:56.170" style="s2">probably was no tarmac on the roads</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.420" end="00:16:01.779" style="s2">I would guess um but then think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.170" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">he&#39;s 23 24 when the first world war</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.779" end="00:16:13.149" style="s2">breaks out so and he&#39;s so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">very destructive or and so he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.149" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">the strange and Lucky&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:22.750" style="s2">what I always think is that were</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:24.760" style="s2">actually quite lucky that there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.750" end="00:16:27.610" style="s2">someone like him who was traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.760" end="00:16:32.740" style="s2">trained in philosophy and theology and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:35.140" style="s2">grew up on a village and and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.740" end="00:16:37.089" style="s2">confronted with any of this and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.140" end="00:16:38.890" style="s2">technology just kicks in like</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.089" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">industrialization it was already of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.890" end="00:16:43.089" style="s2">course you know everywhere but it just</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">kicked in in the 20th century full-on</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.089" end="00:16:48.310" style="s2">and he sees all of these massive changes</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.060" end="00:16:50.170" style="s2">yes then can bring that all to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.310" end="00:16:51.970" style="s2">well while others role is just born into</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.170" end="00:16:54.310" style="s2">it right so we have someone so it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.970" end="00:16:57.220" style="s2">almost like Sullivan a messenger from</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.310" end="00:16:59.800" style="s2">the old world was also in touch with and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.220" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">in dialogue with right this is the in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.800" end="00:17:03.790" style="s2">about dialogue right the strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">about dialogue is that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.790" end="00:17:09.400" style="s2">speak to someone but I was open to hide</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">again I&#39;m in dialogue with him I mean as</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">Bheema you wanted and and that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.809" end="00:17:22.470" style="s2">also what philosophy is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:25.110" style="s2">do huh it seems like yes probably seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.470" end="00:17:28.870" style="s2">like the more people that your daily and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.110" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">dial up who are dead the better</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.299" end="00:17:50.730" style="s2">kind of in it in a certain sense in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.100" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">rare position right in the in in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.730" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">sense that I can remember before the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:57.809" style="s2">internet yeah right I&#39;m I&#39;m around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:01.110" style="s2">of people and I&#39;m around a lot of young</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.809" end="00:18:04.440" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have a memory before</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.110" end="00:18:06.509" style="s2">the internet and they yeah they really</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.440" end="00:18:08.250" style="s2">do seem like they they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.509" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">language and a different they&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.250" end="00:18:14.460" style="s2">like they occur to me is almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">different species yeah but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.460" end="00:18:18.330" style="s2">you know I&#39;m laughing because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:29.639" style="s2">always this cosmic left oh and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.330" end="00:18:31.740" style="s2">face of something absurd that&#39;s good yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.639" end="00:18:34.429" style="s2">yeah because there is something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.740" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">something non-human about technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.429" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing we have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:43.169" style="s2">understand is that this is not human it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:45.149" style="s2">isn&#39;t it is not just an extension of who</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.169" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">we are it says you know the iPhone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.149" end="00:18:52.769" style="s2">just a better looking hammer this if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:54.269" style="s2">don&#39;t see that if someone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.769" end="00:18:59.340" style="s2">see a difference between the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.269" end="00:19:01.649" style="s2">bomb and a screwdriver right right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.340" end="00:19:04.769" style="s2">sorry you know go play somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.649" end="00:19:08.129" style="s2">because this is this is just there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.769" end="00:19:11.159" style="s2">ontological difference that that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.129" end="00:19:13.080" style="s2">as a shift occurred and and people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.159" end="00:19:16.169" style="s2">get sucked into technology too much they</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.080" end="00:19:18.179" style="s2">they become someone else and it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.169" end="00:19:19.980" style="s2">you know when you say they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.179" end="00:19:21.539" style="s2">don&#39;t have a memory before the internet</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.980" end="00:19:24.029" style="s2">you could you could understand there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.539" end="00:19:25.289" style="s2">not just on a notice how we usually</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.029" end="00:19:28.070" style="s2">understand it this is something we</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.289" end="00:19:30.690" style="s2">talked about last night wasn&#39;t it that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.070" end="00:19:31.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a memory before the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.690" end="00:19:35.150" style="s2">internet me</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.730" end="00:19:37.820" style="s2">their memory itself is structured by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.150" end="00:19:41.810" style="s2">internet or by the workings of what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.820" end="00:19:43.640" style="s2">call the Internet 11 there so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.810" end="00:19:48.020" style="s2">greed their identity their persona that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.640" end="00:19:50.150" style="s2">character is by how they memorize who</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.020" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">and what they are what their experiences</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.150" end="00:19:55.660" style="s2">are these are very often immediately</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:59.960" style="s2">externalized and objectified and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.660" end="00:20:04.610" style="s2">hiding it and framed and put and put up</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.960" end="00:20:06.230" style="s2">for evaluation by others and what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.610" end="00:20:10.580" style="s2">certain degree you can also wonder why</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.230" end="00:20:13.010" style="s2">do all of these machines or these robots</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.580" end="00:20:17.930" style="s2">these artificial intelligence units why</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.010" end="00:20:20.360" style="s2">do they all their thirst for evaluations</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.930" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">you actually evaluate everything know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.360" end="00:20:26.420" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and says this thing if</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">you like whatever whatever is doing this</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.420" end="00:20:30.260" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:37.040" style="s2">however really not what it is but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.260" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">occurring their knees evaluations I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.040" end="00:20:41.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange thought maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.860" style="s2">maybe it isn&#39;t I&#39;m not sure but if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.030" end="00:20:46.210" style="s2">can&#39;t see if everything&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.860" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">evaluated then it can work with these</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.210" end="00:20:50.570" style="s2">with these estimates and kind of dig</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:53.750" style="s2">around how everything works</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.570" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">you had your quantification and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.750" end="00:20:59.270" style="s2">begin to mimic and replicate right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:03.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s doing and then feed it</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.270" end="00:21:04.580" style="s2">back to us right maybe one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.020" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">that we notice is that people more and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.580" end="00:21:09.830" style="s2">more speak in cliches in the height of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.340" end="00:21:11.210" style="s2">goodness a certain language always</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.830" end="00:21:14.270" style="s2">that&#39;s it but that&#39;s this may be even</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:16.910" style="s2">more invasive now so but then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.270" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">actually that&#39;s an invitation then to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.910" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">try and be even more even sharper even</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:27.320" style="s2">even more focused and concentrated and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">not distracted and then it begins to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.320" end="00:21:31.250" style="s2">form and I think to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:32.840" style="s2">this is there are things happening here</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.250" end="00:21:38.030" style="s2">in London I&#39;m meeting with people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.840" end="00:21:40.820" style="s2">are who look for exit strategies we are</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:46.270" style="s2">where as meaning is more about a horizon</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.220" end="00:23:47.210" style="s2">that that calls forth in which you you</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.280" end="00:23:55.990" style="s2">with it I think you know and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">me that the big thing about technology</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.990" end="00:24:03.910" style="s2">is the is the man especially especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:05.860" style="s2">with some of these people I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.910" end="00:24:11.050" style="s2">in Silicon Valley it is just really</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.860" end="00:24:16.660" style="s2">weird it&#39;s so autistic um like that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.050" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">that like literally the blindness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.660" end="00:24:22.030" style="s2">the blindness in the intolerance for any</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:27.040" style="s2">kind of struggle the anxiety that comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.030" end="00:24:30.330" style="s2">up in the billikin is like something</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.040" end="00:24:34.390" style="s2">like mastery something that takes is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:37.090" style="s2">that takes time and grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.390" end="00:24:38.770" style="s2">something in DiBella they it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.090" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">up there like look can you give me the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.770" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">three three steps to optimize this this</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:49.690" style="s2">is a process constant and so when they</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:51.820" style="s2">so like right now one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.690" end="00:24:53.980" style="s2">we&#39;re doing at Google is we go to I go</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.820" end="00:24:57.430" style="s2">down to Google um a gun down there three</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.980" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">times and basically circle the Google</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.430" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">people I&#39;m feeling that absurdity tickle</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.500" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">but I think one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.700" end="00:25:20.350" style="s2">did is like we the third time was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">first time we actually did real like</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:27.130" style="s2">just real circling and yeah it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:31.750" style="s2">a it actually was quite beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:34.990" style="s2">striking to me um I think because what</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.750" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">they experienced I think was something</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.990" end="00:25:38.620" style="s2">that was not even something that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:43.030" style="s2">were resisting it just wasn&#39;t in there</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.620" end="00:25:46.110" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t in there horizon there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.030" end="00:25:49.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a certain kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:54.610" style="s2">openness that they have but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.320" end="00:25:57.190" style="s2">the lateral openness it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.610" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">all very aware that they they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.190" end="00:26:00.579" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">right and they want to grow as people</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.579" end="00:26:07.329" style="s2">and they want to be open to feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:09.549" style="s2">they want community however like when</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.329" end="00:26:10.690" style="s2">with circling one of the like dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.549" end="00:26:13.989" style="s2">that we go and choose the depth</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.690" end="00:26:17.109" style="s2">dimension right is is like not actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.989" end="00:26:18.279" style="s2">making things immediate available but</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.109" end="00:26:20.589" style="s2">actually kind of moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.279" end="00:26:23.499" style="s2">concealment and revealing that of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.589" end="00:26:26.379" style="s2">more of a depth dimension and so when</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.499" end="00:26:29.829" style="s2">they started to have that experience it</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.379" end="00:26:31.839" style="s2">was there was the opening of death but</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.829" end="00:26:36.029" style="s2">there was this other thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.839" end="00:26:38.139" style="s2">which was this almost this like striking</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.029" end="00:26:41.829" style="s2">destabilization of that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.139" end="00:26:46.059" style="s2">dimension like that at all right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.829" end="00:26:49.049" style="s2">like a it was it was like a double a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.059" end="00:26:53.049" style="s2">double kind of opening that happened and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.049" end="00:26:56.609" style="s2">I reckon death dimension depth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.049" end="00:26:59.469" style="s2">right like well with them</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.609" end="00:27:01.170" style="s2">what&#39;s a long one more time talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.469" end="00:27:07.410" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.170" end="00:27:11.430" style="s2">um exactly not not any anything planned</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.410" end="00:27:14.940" style="s2">or explicit okay how did they did they</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.430" end="00:27:17.880" style="s2">reach out to you or did you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.940" end="00:27:20.040" style="s2">because if they do they might that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.880" end="00:27:23.220" style="s2">there&#39;s still an openness isn&#39;t that sir</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.040" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">oh yeah yeah totally there&#39;s an openness</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.220" end="00:27:30.450" style="s2">in fact if you go to the Google campus</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:32.130" style="s2">it is what it is really something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:36.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole world</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.130" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">um they have showers they have like gyms</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.020" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">they have like multiple restaurants it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:45.030" style="s2">all all of its free it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">quite something that they have going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.030" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.580" end="00:27:57.010" style="s2">but they yeah that how one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.899" end="00:28:00.789" style="s2">who work there wanted to bring us in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.010" end="00:28:04.269" style="s2">so the Inc Google encourages them to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.789" end="00:28:09.399" style="s2">kind of community building events yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.269" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">and so kind of in that in that way that</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.380" end="00:28:31.630" style="s2">helped me point them to and you put in</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:36.220" style="s2">he said dimensions today mentioned said</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.630" end="00:28:38.380" style="s2">they had Nana maybe for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.220" end="00:28:43.899" style="s2">maybe ever considered could be there</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.380" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">would ya so for example right would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.899" end="00:28:49.630" style="s2">something like remember with this one</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:53.590" style="s2">this one woman who is being circled yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.630" end="00:28:55.659" style="s2">he was I asked her a question that she</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.590" end="00:28:58.029" style="s2">did she didn&#39;t know the she didn&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.279" end="00:29:39.789" style="s2">know and in not know in not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.529" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can just kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.789" end="00:29:45.519" style="s2">getting a relationship with the not</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:50.409" style="s2">knowing like where yeah and then just</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.519" end="00:29:51.700" style="s2">first of all that what you can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.409" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">relationship with that knowing stick</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.700" end="00:29:58.440" style="s2">like stick with it there&#39;s an it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:30:00.490" style="s2">a just that whole thing kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.440" end="00:30:02.340" style="s2">short-circuited it seemed like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.490" end="00:30:05.430" style="s2">set of assumptions that were really like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.340" end="00:30:07.500" style="s2">just weren&#39;t a consideration okay what</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.430" end="00:30:11.340" style="s2">what are the assumptions of the work so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.500" end="00:30:14.580" style="s2">the earth so what I&#39;m hearing is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.340" end="00:30:15.830" style="s2">the Assumption work are not knowing does</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.580" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">not exist</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.830" end="00:30:22.740" style="s2">yeah not knowing is not possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:26.310" style="s2">yeah I I have everything at my fingertip</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.740" end="00:30:27.090" style="s2">yep I can just cut google it pun</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.310" end="00:30:30.030" style="s2">intended</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.090" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">whether it was a bad joke but right but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.030" end="00:30:34.710" style="s2">if this should be the assumptions on</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.340" end="00:30:38.490" style="s2">this campus which is an interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.710" end="00:30:42.900" style="s2">of naming a you know the headquarter of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.490" end="00:30:46.350" style="s2">a corporation yeah I&#39;m mission of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.900" end="00:30:50.400" style="s2">the folks you know associations at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.350" end="00:30:53.400" style="s2">of a university which is a place for</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.400" end="00:30:55.500" style="s2">study in leisure actually also for life</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.400" end="00:30:58.040" style="s2">of the mind and not necessarily just</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.500" end="00:31:02.420" style="s2">being productive and contractual and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.040" end="00:31:06.420" style="s2">transactional yes so the assumption is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.420" end="00:31:11.660" style="s2">and it strikes them them as ought at</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.420" end="00:31:13.730" style="s2">least to say least that there could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.660" end="00:31:17.130" style="s2">said that&#39;s a big word</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.730" end="00:31:20.010" style="s2">nothingness yeah at work or even</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.130" end="00:31:23.070" style="s2">possible within them yes that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.010" end="00:31:32.610" style="s2">damning that leads to immediate anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.070" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">of it yeah it and also um yes like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.610" end="00:31:40.020" style="s2">unknown as a having kind I would say as</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:44.520" style="s2">hasn&#39;t having an ontological presence to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.020" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">it right some way in which it&#39;s here or</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.520" end="00:31:52.430" style="s2">there it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:52.430" style="s2">something about their frame</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.770" end="00:31:56.610" style="s2">that just didn&#39;t include that right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.590" end="00:32:01.290" style="s2">more alike</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.090" end="00:36:00.060" style="s2">and I wonder what the mindset if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.700" end="00:36:02.430" style="s2">like is and at Google precisely is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.060" end="00:36:07.710" style="s2">if they&#39;re actually working sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.430" end="00:36:10.410" style="s2">working to with first of all personally</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.710" end="00:36:15.690" style="s2">on with a framework but also as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.410" end="00:36:18.420" style="s2">institution but towards creating frames</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.690" end="00:36:20.020" style="s2">that don&#39;t allow for anything outside of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.420" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">it outside</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.020" end="00:36:25.660" style="s2">then this gives an insight into Google</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:28.830" style="s2">that maybe it&#39;s not there because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.660" end="00:36:32.140" style="s2">obviously Google employees philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.830" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">but is a usually in-house philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.140" end="00:36:36.010" style="s2">which is say what Google wants to hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:38.110" style="s2">anyways once so they&#39;ll tell them oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.010" end="00:36:39.700" style="s2">look there&#39;s a guy I know who&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.110" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">Oxford he and he&#39;s now the in-house</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.700" end="00:36:45.190" style="s2">philosopher means of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">information right he has to say is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.190" end="00:36:49.570" style="s2">world is just information let&#39;s - let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.580" style="s2">decode it so that&#39;s what you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.570" end="00:36:53.830" style="s2">kind of feeding feeding it&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.580" end="00:36:56.350" style="s2">feedback right I&#39;m just telling them</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.830" end="00:36:57.670" style="s2">what they want to hear anyways yes but</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.350" end="00:36:59.619" style="s2">then again what I find interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.670" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">who has I have Google talks but they</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.619" end="00:37:04.090" style="s2">invite people like knocking Trump&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:07.950" style="s2">and I think even she check another the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.090" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">sewer not a post but at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.950" end="00:37:15.910" style="s2">point to other words so the rest is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:17.740" style="s2">openness still but yeah I think sorry</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.910" end="00:37:19.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like it and that&#39;s what I think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.740" end="00:37:21.940" style="s2">think I talk about is like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.300" end="00:37:25.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an openness that seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.940" end="00:37:29.859" style="s2">to be good this way it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.510" end="00:37:31.540" style="s2">flattened kind of openness uh-huh and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.859" end="00:37:34.780" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is because</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.540" end="00:37:40.990" style="s2">everything about Google when you walk in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.780" end="00:37:44.500" style="s2">there speaks to non here are key but</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.990" end="00:37:47.950" style="s2">it&#39;s so obvious that the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.500" end="00:37:53.020" style="s2">that it&#39;s using to speak know here are</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.950" end="00:37:56.070" style="s2">key is completely weirdly self-denying</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.020" end="00:37:58.660" style="s2">right it&#39;s like and so in in the private</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.070" end="00:38:00.369" style="s2">conversations almost everybody that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.660" end="00:38:03.340" style="s2">talked to that works at Google they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.369" end="00:38:06.550" style="s2">like yeah like Google wants to think</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.340" end="00:38:09.190" style="s2">that they&#39;re really open and liberal and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.550" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">all this stuff but true like actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.190" end="00:38:15.250" style="s2">they&#39;re just they&#39;re more corporate than</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.410" end="00:38:17.950" style="s2">anybody right and there&#39;s a that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.250" end="00:38:23.859" style="s2">thing that you can&#39;t say right I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.950" end="00:38:24.490" style="s2">of to say private so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.859" end="00:38:26.110" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.490" end="00:38:33.550" style="s2">is kind of thing about this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.110" end="00:38:37.570" style="s2">suspicion for depth for things that take</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.550" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">time and struggle really hierarchy in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.570" end="00:38:49.020" style="s2">certain sense right but this you know in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">spin this further man he&#39;s so not</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.020" end="00:38:56.140" style="s2">wanting and I&#39;m saying not wanting a</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.140" end="00:39:03.130" style="s2">something to take time there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.060" end="00:39:05.500" style="s2">talk about how time is speeding up etc</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.130" end="00:39:12.910" style="s2">but I don&#39;t even want to fall into that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.500" end="00:39:18.300" style="s2">but how is it then we then I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.910" end="00:39:22.210" style="s2">ultimately we have to get time right um</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.300" end="00:39:24.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s not linear it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.250" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">something but just a presence thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.210" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">which beings appear in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:08.650" style="s2">appear in time is the self concealment</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:11.020" style="s2">of that presence I&#39;m is what works in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.650" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">that way and we&#39;ve talked about history</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.020" end="00:40:15.430" style="s2">and some of the messages we&#39;ve sent back</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">and forth all right how history rose it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.430" end="00:40:20.980" style="s2">works like that but if you have programs</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:23.080" style="s2">like Google and Google is ism is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.980" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">program to a certain degree right isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.080" end="00:40:28.150" style="s2">intelligence as well um what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:29.350" style="s2">feeding off and what is it that it wants</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.150" end="00:40:31.270" style="s2">to bills are not saying when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.350" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">because that implies sort of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.270" end="00:40:37.940" style="s2">this some evil conspiracy or learned</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:41.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just what is it as</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.940" end="00:40:43.430" style="s2">Google or others what is it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.450" end="00:40:48.230" style="s2">build and why what is it fighting</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.430" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">against its fighting against time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.230" end="00:40:53.900" style="s2">it&#39;s fine if and if Heidegger is right</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:55.940" style="s2">that time is concealed not only but to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.900" end="00:40:59.030" style="s2">certainly be self concealing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.940" end="00:41:00.830" style="s2">absconded yeah and they&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.030" end="00:41:05.150" style="s2">against concealment and then we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.830" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">to this you know any framing of what</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.150" end="00:41:10.040" style="s2">technology wants to do it wants to give</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:12.770" style="s2">you everything immediately is as present</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.040" end="00:41:14.630" style="s2">and available but it isn&#39;t not even or</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.770" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">not even this conversation is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.630" end="00:41:19.390" style="s2">present right because it&#39;ll linger it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">with us we&#39;re only just asked we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">talking yeah in this dialogue and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen without us talking I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.620" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have this dialogue with just</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:35.180" style="s2">about anyone or with myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.620" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">no requires just two of us and invented</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.180" end="00:41:41.590" style="s2">and but then it&#39;s its presence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">just this current moment it&#39;ll recur</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.590" end="00:41:48.320" style="s2">right as we we step out of it at some</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:53.570" style="s2">point yeah and come back to it later but</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.320" end="00:41:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mind-blowing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.570" end="00:41:59.090" style="s2">if you think of time and I&#39;m just doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.640" end="00:42:00.470" style="s2">this now I it as Holly who says is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.090" end="00:42:02.840" style="s2">something that actually does the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.470" end="00:42:05.720" style="s2">concealing or is the self concealing of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.840" end="00:42:07.930" style="s2">every presence yeah and why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.720" end="00:42:10.630" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.930" end="00:42:13.720" style="s2">the suspicion against anything that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.630" end="00:42:15.279" style="s2">takes time you know how nervous we get</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.720" end="00:42:17.559" style="s2">when we type something into Google and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.279" end="00:42:22.299" style="s2">Wi-Fi is slowing down horror it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.559" end="00:42:27.430" style="s2">spitting out the answer merely intense</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.299" end="00:42:31.420" style="s2">anxiety already yes so I wonder I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.430" end="00:42:34.290" style="s2">that happy why is it that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.420" end="00:42:36.990" style="s2">work so</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.290" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">but so much Attalus I mean there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.990" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">much energy going into that right is</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.619" style="s2">that Google is a presence making machine</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t it that&#39;s what it is it makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.619" end="00:42:47.010" style="s2">everything present and available</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.330" end="00:42:49.350" style="s2">immediately but not you know because</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.010" end="00:42:50.940" style="s2">they&#39;re different modes of presence so</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.350" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">when I say present answers this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.940" end="00:42:56.369" style="s2">of in framing presence right um that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.410" style="s2">just presents something it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.369" end="00:43:00.570" style="s2">this is just this is the fact this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.410" end="00:43:01.109" style="s2">the truth this is the first result on</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.570" end="00:43:03.270" style="s2">Google</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.109" end="00:43:06.050" style="s2">speaking of hierarchy I mean sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.270" end="00:43:09.480" style="s2">Google is just by itself what it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.050" end="00:43:11.850" style="s2">perfectly hierarchical yeah everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.480" end="00:43:14.609" style="s2">everyone just clicks hit number one</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.850" end="00:43:17.670" style="s2">right no one cares about page number two</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.609" end="00:43:21.510" style="s2">mind you meet one page one maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.670" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">first three is what I click right right</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.510" end="00:43:28.170" style="s2">perfectly hierarchical in essence but if</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">you think about how much effort and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.170" end="00:43:37.080" style="s2">time and an energy of obviously</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:42.260" style="s2">brilliant young minds has gone into so</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.080" end="00:43:42.260" style="s2">far creating a world of non concealment</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.290" end="00:43:47.940" style="s2">tempted perfect availability and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:51.000" style="s2">immediacy right and then you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.940" end="00:43:53.630" style="s2">just now that there&#39;s an anxiety when</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.000" end="00:43:56.910" style="s2">you talk to there&#39;s this depth dimension</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.630" end="00:43:58.859" style="s2">and by depth you could say there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.910" end="00:44:00.330" style="s2">are conceals dimension because you said</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.859" end="00:44:02.970" style="s2">they weren&#39;t even aware that they those</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.330" end="00:44:05.930" style="s2">were there you see with this the sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.970" end="00:44:08.340" style="s2">of fairness that&#39;s concealed yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.930" end="00:44:10.290" style="s2">necessarily concealed this is also what</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.340" end="00:44:12.119" style="s2">circling dust isn&#39;t it circling as far</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.290" end="00:44:13.770" style="s2">as I now understood and they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.119" end="00:44:15.600" style="s2">done it obviously it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.770" end="00:44:18.840" style="s2">that then you bring to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.600" end="00:44:23.250" style="s2">something that is there but not there</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.840" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">yet fully concealed but then what when</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.250" end="00:44:29.850" style="s2">it&#39;s best when it&#39;s set forth brought</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">out shown it&#39;s not grasped it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.850" end="00:44:34.830" style="s2">become an object right its lingers for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:37.890" style="s2">moment you can&#39;t touch it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.830" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">grasp it in that sense yeah but then it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.890" end="00:44:42.359" style="s2">moves away this is why I I think you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:45.450" style="s2">call it surfing because it goes and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.359" end="00:44:47.800" style="s2">having unique circles yes and or even</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.450" end="00:44:51.070" style="s2">spirals maybe oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.800" end="00:44:55.990" style="s2">and this is an insight into Google I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.070" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">never had is that they the not date but</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.990" end="00:45:01.240" style="s2">some of the people you&#39;ve talked to so</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.790" end="00:45:04.050" style="s2">far if they have this you&#39;re an anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.240" end="00:45:07.060" style="s2">you can also say if it if it&#39;s anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.050" end="00:45:10.150" style="s2">then as Heidegger says it&#39;s only in</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.060" end="00:45:13.030" style="s2">anxiety that the nothingness of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.150" end="00:45:15.700" style="s2">world shows itself it&#39;s only when the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.030" end="00:45:18.340" style="s2">nothingness of the world begins to show</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.700" end="00:45:20.710" style="s2">itself that we actually begin to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.340" end="00:45:23.290" style="s2">the horizons of the world which makes</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.710" end="00:45:25.180" style="s2">the real true world and not this and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.290" end="00:45:27.070" style="s2">this is a quote from someone else in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.180" end="00:45:32.740" style="s2">world that world we live in now where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.070" end="00:45:35.860" style="s2">have no there&#39;s a bit of a lack of place</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.740" end="00:45:41.320" style="s2">or a sense of where we really are yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.860" end="00:45:47.350" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s yeah so I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.320" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2">wonder what why this tear off of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.350" end="00:45:53.470" style="s2">concealment why do we we we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.150" end="00:45:55.090" style="s2">have to have everything at our</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.470" end="00:45:57.910" style="s2">fingertips I think this is what all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.090" end="00:45:59.110" style="s2">these mechanisms or machines of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.910" end="00:46:03.250" style="s2">know what to call it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.110" end="00:46:06.970" style="s2">I actually therefore yeah yeah this word</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.250" end="00:46:11.470" style="s2">of concealment is to get rid of get rid</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.970" end="00:46:14.140" style="s2">of this this these dimensions right yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.470" end="00:46:15.850" style="s2">again it you said there&#39;s a flat</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.140" end="00:46:17.470" style="s2">openness and I think you also said</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.850" end="00:46:19.870" style="s2">something I can&#39;t quite repeat now is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.470" end="00:46:21.370" style="s2">ISM he said they didn&#39;t know there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.870" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">something there so they had never and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.370" end="00:46:25.960" style="s2">there&#39;s what what&#39;s lacking then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:28.390" style="s2">you can translate that in Psychological</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.960" end="00:46:32.410" style="s2">terms maybe and say what&#39;s lacking if</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.390" end="00:46:35.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t respect cuz human is that look</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.410" end="00:46:35.800" style="s2">thank you you can deny death you will</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.050" end="00:46:37.750" style="s2">still die</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.800" end="00:46:40.270" style="s2">right and this is something else until</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.750" end="00:46:43.630" style="s2">we can have it all don&#39;t want to die</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.270" end="00:46:46.330" style="s2">yeah one sees that connects right you</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.630" end="00:46:48.700" style="s2">know it&#39;s a pipe tree you know a chandre</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.330" end="00:46:50.230" style="s2">way i&#39;d british philosopher he said to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.700" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">me in interview six years ago he said</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.230" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">it&#39;s more likely that the debt will rise</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:59.740" style="s2">from them from the earth but um it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:00.710" style="s2">so if you want to get rid of concealment</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.740" end="00:47:02.930" style="s2">you&#39;ll conceal</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.710" end="00:47:08.869" style="s2">sell from yourself you don&#39;t sell</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.930" end="00:47:10.520" style="s2">reflect huh what self-reflection have</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.869" end="00:47:12.770" style="s2">been in the proper self-reflection I</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.510" end="00:50:27.350" style="s2">interpretations of that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:31.610" style="s2">nonsense but they are the neoclassical</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.350" end="00:50:33.650" style="s2">buildings that are statements and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.610" end="00:50:37.100" style="s2">are the Empire State Building is</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.650" end="00:50:38.690" style="s2">beautiful yeah I it&#39;s it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.100" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s classical that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.690" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">classes this is by classical I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:46.760" style="s2">sort of the classical is always capable</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:50.630" style="s2">of Hegel is the last classical think of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.760" end="00:50:52.850" style="s2">Hegel is a thinker who who accepts</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.630" end="00:50:55.850" style="s2">obviously contradictions right he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.850" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">dialectical think and when nature calls</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.850" end="00:51:02.080" style="s2">grand style is even even a step further</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:05.060" style="s2">withered by niacin and the Apple in Ian</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.080" end="00:51:07.370" style="s2">so that backwards artists as the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.060" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">uploading a net which ones chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.370" end="00:51:15.380" style="s2">full life both of them are allowed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:19.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s waste knowing that you need</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.380" end="00:51:21.950" style="s2">both yes the task of of the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.010" end="00:51:25.039" style="s2">of the thinker is always to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.950" end="00:51:28.109" style="s2">two together and let</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.039" end="00:51:32.670" style="s2">do their thing as we could say dude do</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.109" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">what they do but but only in</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.670" end="00:51:36.799" style="s2">relationship with each other because</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:40.010" style="s2">then it becomes something beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.799" end="00:51:46.109" style="s2">what we want is just the Apple in Ian</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.010" end="00:51:48.599" style="s2">and those are the and and or not even be</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.109" end="00:51:52.440" style="s2">able in Ian anymore right because then</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.599" end="00:51:54.299" style="s2">at least you would have proper form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.440" end="00:51:57.569" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something new I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.299" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">what to call it but that facelessness is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.569" end="00:52:03.180" style="s2">something I&#39;ve noticed in what cities</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:06.799" style="s2">are becoming now they&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.180" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">faceless yep yep</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.799" end="00:52:16.740" style="s2">you&#39;re losing there is no distinction</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.440" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">yeah totally distinction right and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.740" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">it&#39;s in in some way it&#39;s been thinking</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:31.380" style="s2">actually yeah and having so many</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.829" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">different thoughts and I the unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.380" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">part is I only have one mouth I mean you</p>

<p begin="00:55:58.630" end="00:56:02.469" style="s2">which I really I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.789" end="00:56:04.599" style="s2">like it I&#39;ve been noticing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.469" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">going by churches and and kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.599" end="00:56:09.969" style="s2">going like those churches look somehow</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:11.529" style="s2">different in the sense where I think you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.969" end="00:56:19.719" style="s2">were talking about where Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.529" end="00:56:22.659" style="s2">Nietzsche basically said that I when I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.719" end="00:56:24.459" style="s2">think what I got was that the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.659" end="00:56:28.280" style="s2">was like the distinction that I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.459" end="00:56:33.290" style="s2">heard what</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.280" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">that in some sense Christianity in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.290" end="00:56:38.690" style="s2">will to truth kind of led to its own</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.930" style="s2">demise</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.690" end="00:56:43.460" style="s2">right it in a certain sense like like</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.930" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">the whole thing about and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.460" end="00:56:49.100" style="s2">about with confession like what&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:51.460" style="s2">what&#39;s true be honest like really look</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.100" end="00:56:56.210" style="s2">at things that on some level that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.460" end="00:56:58.180" style="s2">the actual and then I saw I was walking</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.210" end="00:57:01.850" style="s2">by a church and they say God is truth</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.180" end="00:57:03.560" style="s2">like was central and then next next to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.850" end="00:57:05.120" style="s2">it it was like in cement you know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.560" end="00:57:07.790" style="s2">the brick or something like that it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.120" end="00:57:10.280" style="s2">an older Church in the next next to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.790" end="00:57:12.050" style="s2">was God is love yeah I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.280" end="00:57:15.100" style="s2">that sense of like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.050" end="00:57:15.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.250" end="00:57:26.420" style="s2">the will to truth right insa in some way</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.890" end="00:57:30.560" style="s2">like led to the the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.420" end="00:57:33.500" style="s2">questioning of of the premises in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.560" end="00:57:36.460" style="s2">axioms of the church and undid itself in</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.500" end="00:57:36.460" style="s2">some way</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.840" end="00:57:44.270" style="s2">and how like Nietzsche like articulated</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.840" end="00:57:47.720" style="s2">batter that&#39;s what I got from it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.270" end="00:57:49.880" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;m I&#39;m wondering about that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:52.280" style="s2">sense of and then then it talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.880" end="00:57:53.360" style="s2">like well then at some point right if</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.280" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">he&#39;s just keep you asking yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.360" end="00:58:00.800" style="s2">what&#39;s true right and you keep willing</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">truth that at some point you get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.800" end="00:58:06.380" style="s2">willing the willing that&#39;s willing truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:10.580" style="s2">and then that&#39;s the now becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.380" end="00:58:15.350" style="s2">truth and then there&#39;s this you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.580" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">this kind of like all the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.350" end="00:58:23.060" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about with technology um</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:24.620" style="s2">but just to think about that of cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.060" end="00:58:29.150" style="s2">also wanted to talk with you too about I</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.620" end="00:58:31.910" style="s2">was just wondering about what I just</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.150" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">noticed I feel like when I when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.910" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">about like the what&#39;s going on with with</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">the church and how it&#39;s like like people</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:43.670" style="s2">are just dropping like flies</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">right the amount and I feel so sad about</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.670" end="00:58:49.850" style="s2">that like and I&#39;m surprised cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.060" end="00:58:51.950" style="s2">I actually I&#39;ve never been had any kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.850" end="00:58:55.400" style="s2">of formal religious training or</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.950" end="00:58:57.590" style="s2">upbringing like none of that but I just</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.400" end="00:59:02.200" style="s2">noticed that when I hear those stats I</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.590" end="00:59:02.200" style="s2">feel so sad like</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:13.249" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been also kind of like looking</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.999" end="00:59:13.249" style="s2">at like drawn to these questions about</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:20.330" style="s2">about and so on some level just this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.340" end="00:59:20.330" style="s2">dichotomy between</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.030" end="00:59:31.570" style="s2">like when God like if God&#39;s dead the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.080" end="00:59:38.270" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like the the but the space</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.760" end="00:59:41.540" style="s2">of God doesn&#39;t go away right right</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.270" end="00:59:44.870" style="s2">there&#39;s still if God&#39;s not there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.540" end="00:59:49.640" style="s2">still there they&#39;re on some level that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.870" end="00:59:51.740" style="s2">somehow like work like in concealment</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.640" end="00:59:55.160" style="s2">and I just would I&#39;d love to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.740" end="00:59:57.980" style="s2">your just what your thoughts are about</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.160" end="01:00:01.820" style="s2">like and it but there&#39;s also I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.980" end="01:00:02.980" style="s2">some really good work being done in</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.820" end="01:00:10.010" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.980" end="01:00:13.910" style="s2">paradoxically and in theology right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.010" end="01:00:17.270" style="s2">like the guy David Bentley Hart mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.910" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">are you familiar with him no yes I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.270" end="01:00:22.460" style="s2">send you I&#39;ll send you a video as videos</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:27.280" style="s2">of him he&#39;s quite easy really scholarly</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.460" end="01:00:29.840" style="s2">and he&#39;s just irritating is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.280" end="01:00:32.990" style="s2">it he&#39;s got quite a sense of humor and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.840" end="01:00:35.630" style="s2">he&#39;s just so arrogant but he&#39;s so he</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.990" end="01:00:38.300" style="s2">really can talk salat about Heidegger he</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.630" end="01:00:40.760" style="s2">talks a lot about temporality any in it</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.300" end="01:00:48.500" style="s2">and he&#39;s grappling with this he these</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.760" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">deeper theological questions like what</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.500" end="01:00:53.930" style="s2">is the so i i&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">actually going in for some reason i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.930" end="01:00:58.790" style="s2">been thinking about going in and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:01:00.200" style="s2">actually going to and i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.790" end="01:01:05.060" style="s2">i&#39;m i don&#39;t even know why i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.200" end="01:01:08.030" style="s2">about this yeah but like like going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.060" end="01:01:10.830" style="s2">an orthodox church and then just going</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.030" end="01:01:14.700" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.830" end="01:01:18.300" style="s2">the rituals and like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.700" end="01:01:20.070" style="s2">drawing me there and I I think it has</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.300" end="01:01:22.800" style="s2">something to do I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.070" end="01:01:28.140" style="s2">things that maybe attracts me there is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.800" end="01:01:30.840" style="s2">just this sense of this kind of raping</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.140" end="01:01:33.810" style="s2">of concealment right or the intolerance</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.840" end="01:01:37.470" style="s2">of concealment in our temper ality the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.810" end="01:01:39.810" style="s2">the that sense of it seemed it seemed to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.470" end="01:01:40.740" style="s2">me that you know the way that how I</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.810" end="01:01:43.860" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.740" end="01:01:47.250" style="s2">Heidegger really talks about time is</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.860" end="01:01:51.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not future present past it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.250" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">like future past like the gravity of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.930" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">historicity has the moment shall show up</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:03.210" style="s2">right and that were we&#39;re losing a past</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:07.140" style="s2">like we&#39;re losing a sense of history of</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.210" end="01:02:09.630" style="s2">tradition right oh all that stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.140" end="01:02:14.670" style="s2">just disclosing itself as like shows up</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.630" end="01:02:16.890" style="s2">for people is just yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.670" end="01:02:20.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain I think what</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.890" end="01:02:24.870" style="s2">technology does is attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.100" end="01:02:28.170" style="s2">establish history business yeah Raiders</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.870" end="01:02:33.140" style="s2">history it&#39;s the eternal recurrence of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.170" end="01:02:37.710" style="s2">the same becomes I mean you know and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.140" end="01:02:42.270" style="s2">which you can interpret as a way of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.710" end="01:02:45.000" style="s2">speaking of time yeah coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.270" end="01:02:48.980" style="s2">tradition before we had terms like</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.000" end="01:02:51.420" style="s2">ecstatic or that high degree yet yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.980" end="01:02:55.590" style="s2">but that technology in the Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.420" end="01:03:01.050" style="s2">says this in the text that the true face</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.590" end="01:03:03.750" style="s2">of technology is that it&#39;s circling</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.050" end="01:03:09.060" style="s2">around itself it&#39;s an ever its is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.750" end="01:03:12.990" style="s2">you know recurring of the ever saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.060" end="01:03:15.960" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a Mattson realm</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.990" end="01:03:20.760" style="s2">off there is no history there is no</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.960" end="01:03:22.350" style="s2">sense of coming from somewhere and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.760" end="01:03:24.360" style="s2">there is no sense of going anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.350" end="01:03:26.510" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.360" end="01:03:29.490" style="s2">when you say you go to churches that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.510" end="01:03:33.780" style="s2">there&#39;s always and you mentioned all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.490" end="01:03:36.320" style="s2">docs churches that Russian Orthodox a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.780" end="01:03:39.230" style="s2">Greek Orthodox said there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.320" end="01:03:44.090" style="s2">maybe than in the other Church is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.230" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">certain sense for mystery yeah that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.090" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">lacking and without that without this</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:59.100" style="s2">perfect presence you maybe you get to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">face this unreflective happy but not so</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.100" end="01:04:09.690" style="s2">happy really weird places that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:13.620" style="s2">really places yeah this is the Google</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.690" end="01:04:19.160" style="s2">campus the campus like Oxford University</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.620" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t Simula is it inviting people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.160" end="01:04:27.150" style="s2">wander and vendor and meander where is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:29.180" style="s2">it in a way that&#39;s like professional</p>

<p begin="01:04:31.800" end="01:04:39.640" style="s2">you know like how professional wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.240" end="01:04:43.540" style="s2">there it&#39;s it&#39;s acting ah everyone knows</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.640" end="01:04:46.599" style="s2">it&#39;s acting but yet no one talks about</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.540" end="01:04:49.450" style="s2">how it&#39;s acting I it&#39;s it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.599" end="01:04:51.580" style="s2">bizarre I don&#39;t I I know it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.450" end="01:04:55.480" style="s2">that&#39;s really popular in America I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.580" end="01:05:00.250" style="s2">know it&#39;s missing in Europe and all</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.480" end="01:05:02.200" style="s2">those guys right it&#39;s all scripted no</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.250" end="01:05:03.820" style="s2">one really believes it but yet no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.200" end="01:05:12.520" style="s2">saying that they don&#39;t believe it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.820" end="01:05:14.470" style="s2">that right there&#39;s a yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.520" end="01:05:16.119" style="s2">wondering about like in in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.470" end="01:05:17.859" style="s2">just York wet like this question that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.119" end="01:05:20.020" style="s2">like you and when we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.859" end="01:05:23.609" style="s2">with Google as you as you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.020" end="01:05:27.790" style="s2">about like why is it that we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.609" end="01:05:32.980" style="s2">intolerant of concealment right</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.790" end="01:05:37.380" style="s2">um it&#39;s yeah I I don&#39;t know why to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.980" end="01:05:40.360" style="s2">certain degree also from where this</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.380" end="01:05:43.650" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking to certain degree comes</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.360" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">from is there&#39;s always presents at work</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.650" end="01:05:47.830" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to give you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.200" style="s2">there&#39;s no definite answer at this point</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.830" end="01:05:55.150" style="s2">and I don&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.200" end="01:05:58.090" style="s2">it&#39;s probably to do with a denial of</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.150" end="01:06:03.510" style="s2">death and if you go even deeper</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.090" end="01:06:07.240" style="s2">it is this collapse of the sudden</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.510" end="01:06:09.760" style="s2">disappearance of God maybe rather than</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.240" end="01:06:13.990" style="s2">the death of God it&#39;s just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.760" end="01:06:16.570" style="s2">not I want to say it so much again</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.990" end="01:06:19.210" style="s2">that&#39;s so when Nietzsche says God is</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.570" end="01:06:21.840" style="s2">dead this is very often you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.210" end="01:06:24.850" style="s2">very the youths</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.840" end="01:06:27.070" style="s2">would say yes Wow God is dead I agree</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.850" end="01:06:30.280" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t when you actually read the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.070" end="01:06:33.700" style="s2">madman it&#39;s not a triumph</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.280" end="01:06:36.420" style="s2">yeah but he says is this yes there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.700" end="01:06:38.770" style="s2">horizon you didn&#39;t use the word horizon</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.420" end="01:06:40.450" style="s2">so when there&#39;s no horizon that means</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.770" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no boundary there&#39;s no limit</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.450" end="01:06:46.330" style="s2">when there&#39;s no limit there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:49.020" style="s2">that pushes back against you yes today</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.330" end="01:06:54.310" style="s2">after you want to be in this ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.020" end="01:06:57.970" style="s2">availability where you have everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.310" end="01:07:02.560" style="s2">not even at hand it&#39;s it&#39;s it it needs</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.970" end="01:07:05.890" style="s2">to be there without asking even without</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.560" end="01:07:08.800" style="s2">even it&#39;s there before you even have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.890" end="01:07:12.070" style="s2">think of it and it&#39;s also it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.800" end="01:07:14.770" style="s2">it&#39;s destroying thinking but why is it</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.070" end="01:07:21.370" style="s2">happening it&#39;s I&#39;m not sure why but you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.770" end="01:07:31.290" style="s2">can perhaps say that in in an h or epoch</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.370" end="01:07:31.290" style="s2">rather where meaning disappears we</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.300" end="01:07:44.410" style="s2">hold on to try to maybe build castles</p>

<p begin="01:07:44.410" end="01:07:48.580" style="s2">beyond itself maybe you know except for</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.230" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">we&#39;re building a better world and all</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.580" end="01:07:54.210" style="s2">this nonsense</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.420" end="01:07:59.530" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s I&#39;m I&#39;m not sure where it</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.550" end="01:08:02.230" style="s2">comes from like in at the moment maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.530" end="01:08:06.660" style="s2">you maybe need to hear the question</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.230" end="01:08:09.670" style="s2">again so I can in this because I expect</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.660" end="01:08:14.090" style="s2">your question then I was highlighting</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.670" end="01:08:17.660" style="s2">with the with</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.090" end="01:08:19.400" style="s2">something right on the periphery of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.660" end="01:08:22.300" style="s2">just noticing that like kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.400" end="01:08:26.810" style="s2">a way in which I am oriented in the in</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.300" end="01:08:28.700" style="s2">the conversation which is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.810" end="01:08:29.930" style="s2">this sense of like basically I think the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.700" end="01:08:32.030" style="s2">question that you had asked earlier</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.930" end="01:08:34.820" style="s2">which is in Anton relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.030" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">Google which is like what is this what</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.820" end="01:08:42.620" style="s2">is this in basically intolerance or</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:50.120" style="s2">anxiety around concealment right like</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.620" end="01:08:52.190" style="s2">what and I if if this sense of just what</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.120" end="01:08:54.830" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about like horizons I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.190" end="01:08:57.589" style="s2">love the notion of a right it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.830" end="01:09:00.950" style="s2">can think about horizons for God forever</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.589" end="01:09:05.240" style="s2">um yeah but this sense of the having</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.950" end="01:09:07.730" style="s2">lost it because they&#39;re it&#39;s true like</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.240" end="01:09:10.250" style="s2">if I I tried to get at this in a like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.730" end="01:09:12.230" style="s2">little video that I made for my students</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.250" end="01:09:15.680" style="s2">when I just I just took my phone and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.230" end="01:09:17.450" style="s2">pointed on the ground like and I was</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.680" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">like okay just get this experience like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.450" end="01:09:21.109" style="s2">you&#39;re just looking at it&#39;s like an inch</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.560" end="01:09:22.790" style="s2">away from the ground right and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.109" end="01:09:24.710" style="s2">even tell that you&#39;re looking at dirt</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.790" end="01:09:28.520" style="s2">right and then there&#39;s a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.710" end="01:09:30.440" style="s2">where it comes like I you know I lift it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.520" end="01:09:32.660" style="s2">up a little bit and then you can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.440" end="01:09:34.250" style="s2">see a rock but you don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.660" end="01:09:38.500" style="s2">rock is and then you see a little blade</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.250" end="01:09:38.500" style="s2">of grass and I was like okay now</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.590" end="01:09:45.900" style="s2">look at this right now all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.180" end="01:09:49.450" style="s2">you get oh it&#39;s the ground but before</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.900" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">before you had the horizon of like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.450" end="01:09:55.210" style="s2">grass you could see the grass the ground</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:56.860" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there like in some way and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.210" end="01:09:58.120" style="s2">he go all the way up and pretty soon the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.860" end="01:10:00.220" style="s2">ocean and you see the Golden Gate Bridge</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.120" end="01:10:04.740" style="s2">and then you look back and now when you</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.220" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">look at that there&#39;s so much more in</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.740" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">some way in some way there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:16.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that everything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.320" end="01:10:21.460" style="s2">present in what you&#39;re looking at right</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.180" end="01:10:23.800" style="s2">is actually fills it up with the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.460" end="01:10:25.810" style="s2">of like oh it&#39;s in San Francisco there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.800" end="01:10:28.690" style="s2">a place there&#39;s an orientation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.810" end="01:10:32.020" style="s2">like it animates it becomes what it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.690" end="01:10:33.550" style="s2">and without that it&#39;s you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.020" end="01:10:34.750" style="s2">what it is you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.550" end="01:10:38.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.750" end="01:10:42.430" style="s2">looking for and so there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.110" end="01:10:46.150" style="s2">sense of like well okay like if if like</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.430" end="01:10:51.630" style="s2">the horizon is gone yeah all we have is</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.150" end="01:10:55.240" style="s2">stuff right yeah all we have is stuff</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.630" end="01:10:59.620" style="s2">that which is measurable and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.240" end="01:11:04.270" style="s2">if if there&#39;s concealment what is</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.620" end="01:11:08.010" style="s2">concealment without a horizon like like</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.270" end="01:11:12.040" style="s2">it seems like with the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.010" end="01:11:13.990" style="s2">concealment is is what the what their</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.040" end="01:11:16.450" style="s2">eyes and announces right cuz it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.990" end="01:11:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s it announces something</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.450" end="01:11:23.170" style="s2">beyond the horizon right that you move</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.440" end="01:11:25.180" style="s2">towards but then the then the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.170" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">horizon becomes the ground because you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.180" end="01:11:30.310" style="s2">can&#39;t ever reach the horizon right so</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:32.830" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of sense of unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.310" end="01:11:37.050" style="s2">Hurun concealment where there&#39;s a yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.830" end="01:11:37.050" style="s2">where the unknown actually becomes</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.030" end="01:11:43.850" style="s2">something to move towards right in</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.610" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">orient around right patient that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.850" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">it&#39;s orient this is Nietzsche&#39;s says</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:55.450" style="s2">that basically there is now a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:12:00.680" style="s2">orientation yeah you cannot have</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.450" end="01:12:02.630" style="s2">cosmology that say I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.680" end="01:12:04.190" style="s2">the names without people people who are</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.630" end="01:12:06.470" style="s2">so-called content philosophers in</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.190" end="01:12:10.370" style="s2">America who now talk about cosmology of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.470" end="01:12:15.020" style="s2">black holes that&#39;s meaningless a cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.370" end="01:12:17.690" style="s2">is a closed continue yeah that that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.020" end="01:12:22.130" style="s2">in itself meaningful in the black hole</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.690" end="01:12:27.140" style="s2">is the exact opposite of meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.130" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the moment that this the</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.140" end="01:12:31.970" style="s2">moment that you concede the cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:35.870" style="s2">begins to collapse in modernity when the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.970" end="01:12:38.570" style="s2">Telos is taking away from the the final</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.870" end="01:12:41.480" style="s2">cost so called from from things right</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.570" end="01:12:42.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it begins to burst open and that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.480" end="01:12:46.250" style="s2">are with we&#39;re now where everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.920" end="01:12:48.590" style="s2">just expanding and exploding for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.250" end="01:12:51.220" style="s2">sake of why why is the universe</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.590" end="01:12:56.750" style="s2">expanding book because it&#39;s expanding</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.220" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">why and so I think that with the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.750" end="01:13:03.260" style="s2">breaking one you think about this is me</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:09.920" style="s2">Cheney I think in the 1870s in Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.260" end="01:13:12.890" style="s2">in 1927 or in 1925 says if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.920" end="01:13:15.770" style="s2">mean if there&#39;s any meaningful formula</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.890" end="01:13:18.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not Colby - ergo so it&#39;s so more</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.770" end="01:13:26.990" style="s2">abundance I am because I am towards my</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.440" end="01:13:29.090" style="s2">death yeah so so I am because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.990" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">towards my death that&#39;s how I that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.090" end="01:13:34.850" style="s2">where my meaning comes from and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:37.430" style="s2">being towards death means not beating</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.850" end="01:13:41.150" style="s2">towards the horizon because death is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.430" end="01:13:46.050" style="s2">a horizon horizon you know very strictly</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.150" end="01:13:49.659" style="s2">speaking does have to do with with</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.050" end="01:13:51.550" style="s2">with with with someone projecting and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.659" end="01:13:54.369" style="s2">someone making sense the death is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.550" end="01:13:58.750" style="s2">that but death as an ultimate limit</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.369" end="01:14:03.040" style="s2">gives rise to horizon and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.750" end="01:14:05.559" style="s2">Heidegger posits almost as this if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.040" end="01:14:08.679" style="s2">know it has almost possibility ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.559" end="01:14:12.340" style="s2">limit that from which I received meaning</p>

<p begin="01:14:21.639" end="01:14:27.460" style="s2">the death of God and this is not tip to</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.610" end="01:14:30.420" style="s2">use us to our death or mortality or</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.460" end="01:14:34.630" style="s2">anything it&#39;s actually I think about us</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.420" end="01:14:36.760" style="s2">realizing that in this epoch we have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.630" end="01:14:38.829" style="s2">come to terms without finitude and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.760" end="01:14:41.469" style="s2">was always struck me is that yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.829" end="01:14:43.570" style="s2">is why it&#39;s important to hear about</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.469" end="01:14:45.760" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside of Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.570" end="01:14:49.780" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s why are they working against</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.760" end="01:14:51.730" style="s2">death yeah um they are yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.780" end="01:14:54.280" style="s2">working against death because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.519" end="01:16:56.829" style="s2">certain degree has to do with consuming</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.210" end="01:17:21.039" style="s2">is this very strange is what is it</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.670" end="01:17:24.820" style="s2">actually is not a place medium that this</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.039" end="01:17:28.420" style="s2">that if you just spent time with it on</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.820" end="01:17:30.639" style="s2">your own it time just disappears and but</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.420" end="01:17:33.039" style="s2">not in the not in this ecstatic sense of</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.639" end="01:17:35.139" style="s2">that you get when you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.039" end="01:17:37.420" style="s2">extremely you know at the peak of your</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.139" end="01:17:39.550" style="s2">creativity well you wait you create</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.420" end="01:17:41.260" style="s2">something timed us in that sense there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.550" end="01:17:45.039" style="s2">a P and become exciting you could become</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.260" end="01:17:48.249" style="s2">you you&#39;re maybe you know really precise</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.039" end="01:17:51.010" style="s2">and quick and doing something in a short</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.249" end="01:17:53.949" style="s2">amount of time but in time cuz it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.010" end="01:17:55.599" style="s2">gone from when you binge watching</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.949" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">Netflix for example it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.599" end="01:18:00.539" style="s2">killing time</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">and I this expression English is just</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.539" end="01:18:07.630" style="s2">again very fascinating to speak of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:10.420" style="s2">killing time and this is not my idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.630" end="01:18:12.820" style="s2">this is I forgot their names that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.420" end="01:18:15.699" style="s2">critical critical theorists from Germany</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.820" end="01:18:20.320" style="s2">you say that the Internet is the new</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.699" end="01:18:23.440" style="s2">stance and this standing now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.320" end="01:18:31.380" style="s2">that&#39;s still you know you can still</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.440" end="01:18:36.040" style="s2">transform it and but but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.380" end="01:18:39.460" style="s2">it&#39;s weirdly enough it&#39;s it&#39;s oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.040" end="01:18:42.040" style="s2">always something working against time</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.460" end="01:18:45.070" style="s2">and the time of human beings and how we</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.040" end="01:18:48.550" style="s2">are temporally in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.070" end="01:18:51.550" style="s2">therefore you know it&#39;s it&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.550" end="01:18:53.560" style="s2">say that there&#39;s a lack of horizons then</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.550" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">that means that there is no world in</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.560" end="01:18:58.570" style="s2">that sense right right the world is what</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:19:00.790" style="s2">is the world the world isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.570" end="01:19:03.969" style="s2">Heidegger always says world isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.790" end="01:19:06.820" style="s2">know the everything around us or it</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.969" end="01:19:12.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t just a collection of</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.820" end="01:19:14.770" style="s2">things world is the horizon or the</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.070" end="01:19:19.270" style="s2">background against which beings appear</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.770" end="01:19:21.610" style="s2">as meaningful yeah and and and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.270" end="01:19:23.260" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s something completely</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.610" end="01:19:25.690" style="s2">different from saying it&#39;s just data</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.260" end="01:19:27.989" style="s2">it&#39;s just information that&#39;s all stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.690" end="01:19:36.010" style="s2">it&#39;s just all the stuff that there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.989" end="01:19:38.980" style="s2">right it&#39;s yeah I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.010" end="01:19:45.909" style="s2">trying to do is in in this epoch is Bill</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.980" end="01:19:47.260" style="s2">building the total denial of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.909" end="01:19:50.260" style="s2">meaning of the historical significance</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.260" end="01:19:57.010" style="s2">of the death of God or the disappearance</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.260" end="01:19:59.619" style="s2">of the divine and in that sense also you</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.010" end="01:20:00.840" style="s2">know this intolerance or even fear of</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.619" end="01:20:05.800" style="s2">concealment</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.840" end="01:20:08.380" style="s2">mystery and there&#39;s no sense of wonder</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.800" end="01:20:12.940" style="s2">and I I do wonder I mean you know as you</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.380" end="01:20:18.670" style="s2">know careers are unreal okay I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.940" end="01:20:20.739" style="s2">their fantasies yes but I have a friend</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.670" end="01:20:23.190" style="s2">of mine whose son works for a major</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.739" end="01:20:25.090" style="s2">international corporation very</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.190" end="01:20:26.530" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.090" end="01:20:30.400" style="s2">maybe that been googled they produce</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.530" end="01:20:34.060" style="s2">actually something son</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.400" end="01:20:36.580" style="s2">no no one of my friends son but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.060" end="01:20:40.119" style="s2">this gentleman he&#39;s in his late 60s and</p>

<p begin="01:20:40.119" end="01:20:45.340" style="s2">he said to look that corporation work</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.429" end="01:20:48.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t real it&#39;s just a fantasy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.340" end="01:20:52.330" style="s2">enough people who believe in it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.159" end="01:20:54.369" style="s2">there to make money and in pace you pays</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.330" end="01:20:57.219" style="s2">your bills and everything but you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.369" end="01:21:00.639" style="s2">to build up and I think what so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.219" end="01:21:04.290" style="s2">what&#39;s what one I think maybe one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.639" end="01:21:07.949" style="s2">greatest threats or dangerous coming</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.290" end="01:21:12.040" style="s2">within the next decades is that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.949" end="01:21:13.389" style="s2">people forget to build up their their</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.040" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">building their careers and their</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.389" end="01:21:20.770" style="s2">building may be equity and blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:26.590" style="s2">blah but we need to we have to build up</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.770" end="01:21:31.349" style="s2">ways of making sense of the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.590" end="01:21:36.989" style="s2">beyond these momentary because</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.349" end="01:21:42.389" style="s2">everything&#39;s short-lived and fast</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.989" end="01:21:45.460" style="s2">quickly there and then gone again it</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.389" end="01:21:47.110" style="s2">mean the collapse of meaning is also</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.460" end="01:21:48.869" style="s2">something that you know if you take it</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.110" end="01:21:52.449" style="s2">seriously and you want to be responsible</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.869" end="01:21:53.980" style="s2">they have to build up ways of making</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.449" end="01:21:56.230" style="s2">sense of the world that aren&#39;t crudely</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.980" end="01:21:57.790" style="s2">subjective istic yeah a lot of him</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.230" end="01:21:59.710" style="s2">writing always talks about isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.790" end="01:22:03.489" style="s2">let&#39;s learn we have to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.710" end="01:22:05.560" style="s2">subjects of this and it&#39;s yeah but then</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.489" end="01:22:08.020" style="s2">we&#39;re just stuck with all you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.560" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t matter all I have to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.020" end="01:22:16.360" style="s2">is make say this is meaningful to me and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:19.989" style="s2">that&#39;s consumerism works right you buy</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.360" end="01:22:23.830" style="s2">your identity right you buy meaning for</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.989" end="01:22:26.409" style="s2">for a brief moment right yeah but but to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.830" end="01:22:30.280" style="s2">me it is switching yourself off for five</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.409" end="01:22:35.159" style="s2">or six or maybe more hours on on a death</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.280" end="01:22:37.510" style="s2">machine like like Netflix that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.159" end="01:22:38.710" style="s2">telling that this is happening</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.510" end="01:22:44.370" style="s2">it&#39;s quite the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.710" end="01:22:48.820" style="s2">there&#39;s something that then that</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.370" end="01:22:50.410" style="s2">something that it&#39;s not I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.820" end="01:22:53.190" style="s2">there&#39;s so much you know that there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.410" end="01:22:56.530" style="s2">much capacity for people to talk but</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.190" end="01:22:58.719" style="s2">there&#39;s still not enough being said I</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.530" end="01:23:02.469" style="s2">think about these fundamental dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.719" end="01:23:04.360" style="s2">of existence where and of course you</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.469" end="01:23:05.950" style="s2">know the other the other danger is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.360" end="01:23:08.080" style="s2">it just becomes this is what hiding</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.950" end="01:23:09.910" style="s2">assess in the 30s he says you know I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.080" end="01:23:11.650" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have I shouldn&#39;t have written</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.910" end="01:23:13.660" style="s2">this book and everybody talks about</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.650" end="01:23:17.380" style="s2">being and that just means that being is</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.660" end="01:23:19.390" style="s2">forgotten even more yeah so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.380" end="01:23:22.719" style="s2">know the strange thing is that if we</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.390" end="01:23:25.989" style="s2">let&#39;s just talk about concealment the it</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.719" end="01:23:28.989" style="s2">becomes almost like an object itself but</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.989" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">if not then there&#39;s there&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.989" end="01:23:33.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger of just turning it into</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:39.160" style="s2">something at them you make one makes I</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.580" end="01:23:42.690" style="s2">mean something we work with or operate</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.160" end="01:23:51.690" style="s2">with right it&#39;s rather I think about a</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.690" end="01:23:54.610" style="s2">slow building off of both ways so that</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.690" end="01:23:57.910" style="s2">there will be a time again we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.610" end="01:24:00.219" style="s2">rule that to happen well but such that</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.910" end="01:24:03.489" style="s2">there is that openings as I say in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.219" end="01:24:07.150" style="s2">this video lecture that openings in</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.489" end="01:24:10.570" style="s2">history again that can come about but</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.150" end="01:24:14.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a slow build-up to that and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.570" end="01:24:18.239" style="s2">you know you a sense of wonder a sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.890" end="01:24:23.560" style="s2">of mystery those will come back perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.239" end="01:24:27.250" style="s2">but we can&#39;t rule them to come and we we</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.560" end="01:24:29.860" style="s2">yeah its businesses yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.250" end="01:24:31.630" style="s2">Heidegger - maybe summarize what I tried</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.860" end="01:24:35.080" style="s2">to say is that Heidegger I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.630" end="01:24:38.500" style="s2">responds to the death of God by making</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.080" end="01:24:41.260" style="s2">us aware of our mortal finitude and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.500" end="01:24:45.340" style="s2">saying without that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.260" end="01:24:48.040" style="s2">horizon now this is what constitutes our</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.340" end="01:24:52.270" style="s2">horizons is our infinity we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.040" end="01:24:53.980" style="s2">aware of it and not work against it um</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.270" end="01:24:58.480" style="s2">this is where meaning could rise from</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.980" end="01:25:00.930" style="s2">from being mortally finite rather than</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.480" end="01:25:02.950" style="s2">as Nietzsche says you know where are we</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.930" end="01:25:05.460" style="s2">we don&#39;t know where we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.950" end="01:25:05.460" style="s2">floating</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.100" end="01:25:11.920" style="s2">Nietzsche says he speaks of the eternal</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.590" end="01:25:16.420" style="s2">recurrence of the same as a heavy the</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.920" end="01:25:20.620" style="s2">heaviest weight that&#39;s because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.420" end="01:25:23.200" style="s2">floating away and this floating maybe</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.620" end="01:25:25.180" style="s2">that&#39;s you could maybe translate that as</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.200" end="01:25:27.760" style="s2">saying that there is no depth dimension</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.180" end="01:25:29.500" style="s2">about that there&#39;s no awareness off of</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.760" end="01:25:31.470" style="s2">other dimensions of what they have</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.500" end="01:25:35.110" style="s2">immediately present about themselves</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.470" end="01:25:39.520" style="s2">which is that Korea in Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.110" end="01:25:41.560" style="s2">which is yeah it is pursuing that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:45.940" style="s2">ladders they climb up or pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.560" end="01:25:48.670" style="s2">certain things that are in this no time</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.940" end="01:25:50.920" style="s2">period extremely important and</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.670" end="01:25:56.110" style="s2">hierarchically you know this great</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.920" end="01:26:02.050" style="s2">status that comes with it yes um but but</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.110" end="01:26:04.740" style="s2">this yeah this lack off off from kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.050" end="01:26:09.450" style="s2">appreciating that not everything can be</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.740" end="01:26:13.870" style="s2">maybe you know quantifying etc that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.450" end="01:26:15.780" style="s2">hmm think about like what couple things</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.870" end="01:26:18.070" style="s2">couple things one of the things I just</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.780" end="01:26:19.690" style="s2">appreciated this about about our</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.070" end="01:26:23.670" style="s2">conversation last time I&#39;m appreciating</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.690" end="01:26:23.670" style="s2">it again about what you said about uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.360" end="01:26:31.360" style="s2">the I think he quoted Hegel and that</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.020" end="01:26:36.910" style="s2">saying that the philosopher dies of</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.360" end="01:26:40.270" style="s2">worry every day every day right every</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.910" end="01:26:44.890" style="s2">day I and I really feel I feel that in</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.270" end="01:26:46.780" style="s2">you but I feel like in a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.890" end="01:26:50.620" style="s2">something I did the thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.780" end="01:26:52.690" style="s2">ask you about too is when you in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.620" end="01:26:57.450" style="s2">beginning you said yeah I just wrote</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.690" end="01:27:02.230" style="s2">down this thing in my journal right like</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.450" end="01:27:06.600" style="s2">thinks and think right and yeah what is</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.230" end="01:27:14.850" style="s2">that what is that that like</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.600" end="01:27:18.569" style="s2">what that did what what have you write</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.850" end="01:27:21.989" style="s2">that down what what is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.569" end="01:27:24.089" style="s2">what is that that that&#39;s moving right -</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.989" end="01:27:26.729" style="s2">what is this thing that&#39;s like having us</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.089" end="01:27:30.719" style="s2">just go mad in the conversation right</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.729" end="01:27:37.019" style="s2">like cuz there&#39;s so many yeah yeah what</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.719" end="01:27:41.099" style="s2">is that I have no idea this it just</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.019" end="01:27:42.929" style="s2">comes yeah yeah just just come these</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.099" end="01:27:48.299" style="s2">thoughts it&#39;s just all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.929" end="01:27:51.299" style="s2">banana yes make sense so I&#39;m I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.299" end="01:27:53.729" style="s2">outside I was taking a walk and just all</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.299" end="01:27:56.369" style="s2">just all of a sudden opened up and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.729" end="01:27:58.709" style="s2">thought of gratitude in terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.369" end="01:28:00.479" style="s2">consumerism mixed gratitude impossible</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.709" end="01:28:02.969" style="s2">because everything&#39;s always there now</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.479" end="01:28:10.619" style="s2">you know you know not grateful for for</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.969" end="01:28:14.719" style="s2">for an Ikea glass or yeah or you know or</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.619" end="01:28:17.909" style="s2">anything really whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo praises</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.719" end="01:28:25.139" style="s2">the Lord or anything or anyone for the</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.909" end="01:28:28.459" style="s2">food they write its and that hit me</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.139" end="01:28:28.459" style="s2">today and they stopped I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.549" end="01:28:35.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack of gratitude</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.709" end="01:28:37.789" style="s2">and and what you can learn from hiding</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.309" end="01:28:39.839" style="s2">it is how you know you know he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.789" end="01:28:41.939" style="s2">ridiculed for saying that</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.839" end="01:28:44.039" style="s2">thinking is Duncan that thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.939" end="01:28:46.949" style="s2">thanking yeah and it&#39;s pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.039" end="01:28:49.889" style="s2">ridicule that but what was much more</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.949" end="01:28:52.799" style="s2">difficult is to appreciate it and to</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.889" end="01:28:55.530" style="s2">actually appreciate also that beauty and</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.799" end="01:28:58.649" style="s2">hearing that in language because who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.530" end="01:29:00.749" style="s2">says that you know it like words just</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.649" end="01:29:03.569" style="s2">mean with the dictionary tells us and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.749" end="01:29:06.329" style="s2">that it&#39;s not possible to hear something</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.569" end="01:29:09.149" style="s2">in a word that no one else has heard</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.329" end="01:29:11.219" style="s2">maybe before why would why would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.149" end="01:29:14.129" style="s2">denied why would then not be allowed</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.219" end="01:29:16.229" style="s2">right there&#39;s a who&#39;s decided that so</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.129" end="01:29:18.839" style="s2">thinking is thanking it means first of</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.229" end="01:29:23.459" style="s2">all there&#39;s a credit ood for being able</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.839" end="01:29:29.069" style="s2">to think at all and then I think this</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.459" end="01:29:29.770" style="s2">this the stands one can take is you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.069" end="01:29:31.690" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.770" end="01:29:38.350" style="s2">his hometown he thinks it sometime for</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.690" end="01:29:43.630" style="s2">being for being there yeah so that he</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.350" end="01:29:47.830" style="s2">could be man and he does I think at some</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.630" end="01:29:52.740" style="s2">point he said to his brother that it</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.830" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">thinks in me he a B he wrote as you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.740" end="01:30:00.180" style="s2">put some volumes there&#39;s about 100</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:04.870" style="s2">published now and there could be more</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.180" end="01:30:08.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s it things in me and if you ask</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.870" end="01:30:12.130" style="s2">what is it maybe to beast strictly I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:30:35.590" end="01:30:46.150" style="s2">and that I miss you could think off and</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.890" end="01:30:50.230" style="s2">he does that as coming into its own wild</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.150" end="01:30:54.360" style="s2">disappearing and absconded coming into</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.230" end="01:30:59.110" style="s2">its own well it&#39;s a it&#39;s a realm he says</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.360" end="01:31:04.300" style="s2">like yeah a proper realm where being and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.110" end="01:31:06.040" style="s2">the human being meat is the I guess is</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.300" end="01:31:08.850" style="s2">not a substance and I think the I guess</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.040" end="01:31:12.070" style="s2">is that which that which throws itself</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.850" end="01:31:14.380" style="s2">yeah catches itself that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.070" end="01:31:17.050" style="s2">experimenting with you know ways of</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.380" end="01:31:22.720" style="s2">thinking and I&#39;ve missed in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.050" end="01:31:26.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s Agnes he says is what all of</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.720" end="01:31:28.360" style="s2">metaphysics has always responded to</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.560" end="01:31:30.400" style="s2">without knowing that that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.360" end="01:31:32.170" style="s2">responding to and that&#39;s how you get to</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.400" end="01:31:35.230" style="s2">the epochs of being in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.170" end="01:31:38.110" style="s2">people they did it could perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.230" end="01:31:42.160" style="s2">possible to say that within Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.110" end="01:31:43.489" style="s2">thought that what&#39;s taking over what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:31:43.489" end="01:31:49.580" style="s2">is that what heilige calls that is is a</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.130" end="01:31:52.340" style="s2">certain realm where their being and that</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.580" end="01:31:55.940" style="s2">also means history and possibilities of</p>

<p begin="01:32:03.530" end="01:32:07.550" style="s2">history right so that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.510" end="01:32:09.739" style="s2">humanism would say we&#39;re kind of where</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.550" end="01:32:12.830" style="s2">the center of everything we do will lead</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.739" end="01:32:13.940" style="s2">to this that no it&#39;s how we respond to</p>

<p begin="01:32:13.940" end="01:32:19.910" style="s2">that feeds back in so that comes back</p>

<p begin="01:32:21.710" end="01:32:28.550" style="s2">Nietzsche certainly that&#39;s when he has</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.040" end="01:32:47.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how this becomes about and</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.320" end="01:32:50.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the agnes as it were itself</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.650" end="01:32:55.219" style="s2">because it&#39;s this realm where this this</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.840" end="01:32:57.950" style="s2">possibility opens up and when we respond</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.219" end="01:33:01.040" style="s2">to it we respond in a way to it</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.950" end="01:33:04.010" style="s2">currently if you more more than ever</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.040" end="01:33:07.610" style="s2">where we try to make everything</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.010" end="01:33:11.180" style="s2">available for us but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.610" end="01:33:15.890" style="s2">another layer to that which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.180" end="01:33:22.940" style="s2">what&#39;s making us do that isn&#39;t us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.890" end="01:33:26.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s distinctly non-human what what</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.940" end="01:33:28.969" style="s2">happens in technology and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.210" end="01:33:32.960" style="s2">why because what once once you work</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.969" end="01:33:37.989" style="s2">against mortality you are working</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.960" end="01:33:37.989" style="s2">against you what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.469" end="01:33:45.580" style="s2">you&#39;re trying what you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.900" end="01:33:45.580" style="s2">attempt to eradicate I</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.619" end="01:33:58.969" style="s2">one because it&#39;s it it takes away that</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.900" end="01:34:02.739" style="s2">dimension of our history that is what we</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.969" end="01:34:06.500" style="s2">all suffer through yeah and that makes</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.739" end="01:34:08.179" style="s2">anything ultimately meaningful yes or</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.500" end="01:34:11.810" style="s2">encounter with our death</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.179" end="01:34:19.130" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and then you create this</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.810" end="01:34:22.610" style="s2">this fake realm of off of you know a</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.130" end="01:34:24.159" style="s2">deathless sphere which is also as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.610" end="01:34:27.679" style="s2">described it faceless</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.159" end="01:34:34.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no distinction right you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.679" end="01:34:36.440" style="s2">this is slowly coming about right no not</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.880" end="01:34:38.719" style="s2">everywhere you know because you can save</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.440" end="01:34:41.330" style="s2">the that that&#39;s you know unevenly</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.719" end="01:34:43.219" style="s2">distributed it&#39;s not everywhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.330" end="01:34:45.489" style="s2">it&#39;s not that that&#39;s another thing of</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.219" end="01:34:50.690" style="s2">beauty is that it&#39;s not all-powerful</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.489" end="01:34:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not everywhere but it is so slowly</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.690" end="01:34:57.849" style="s2">showing itself that that&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.000" end="01:35:01.280" style="s2">of what could be coming and or is</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.849" end="01:35:04.760" style="s2">announcing itself but then again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.280" end="01:35:09.280" style="s2">not it&#39;s not fatalism it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.760" end="01:35:11.659" style="s2">that we the way we respond to it changes</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.280" end="01:35:17.120" style="s2">your feeds back into what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.659" end="01:35:20.930" style="s2">and then comes back from behind in waves</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.120" end="01:35:22.430" style="s2">and that you know if you ask personally</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.930" end="01:35:26.900" style="s2">what is it I have no idea it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.430" end="01:35:30.800" style="s2">been there and if I don&#39;t think or write</p>

<p begin="01:35:40.790" end="01:35:47.180" style="s2">gonna sit down and think about death for</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.610" end="01:35:50.090" style="s2">10 hours right right right</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.180" end="01:35:52.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it as there&#39;s no it is not I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:35:52.190" end="01:35:56.900" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s just in Psychological</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.010" end="01:36:00.620" style="s2">terms you could say it&#39;s a pool yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.900" end="01:36:04.960" style="s2">something pulling right Mac quite sure</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.620" end="01:36:08.840" style="s2">what but yeah and it&#39;s the cut thing you</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.960" end="01:36:12.700" style="s2">you said about Nietzsche about history</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.840" end="01:36:19.220" style="s2">in the silence in the silent notes of</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.700" end="01:36:29.270" style="s2">that yeah like that began that thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.220" end="01:36:31.700" style="s2">about listening right just that and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.270" end="01:36:34.030" style="s2">yes listening so you could even say that</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.700" end="01:36:36.710" style="s2">you know history history isn&#39;t this this</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.030" end="01:36:39.860" style="s2">one event after another succession of</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.710" end="01:36:42.440" style="s2">big stuff in the news or anything or</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.860" end="01:36:46.040" style="s2">whatever is in history books that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.440" end="01:36:49.610" style="s2">weirdly enough part of it but there is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.040" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">there is a melody to history I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.610" end="01:36:56.930" style="s2">what Heidegger wants us to make us aware</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.840" end="01:36:59.360" style="s2">off again remind us off we said there is</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.930" end="01:37:02.150" style="s2">this lingering melody that we can begin</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.360" end="01:37:05.800" style="s2">to hear and then it slowly begins to</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.150" end="01:37:08.240" style="s2">make sense yeah it&#39;s a god down these</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.800" end="01:37:13.580" style="s2">beautiful artworks like for example good</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.240" end="01:37:16.580" style="s2">is Faust which is one if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.580" end="01:37:19.490" style="s2">understand modernity that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.580" end="01:37:22.490" style="s2">one of the texts you have to look at as</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.490" end="01:37:26.210" style="s2">good as fast okay wanting someone to</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.490" end="01:37:29.300" style="s2">tell me about Faust well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.210" end="01:37:30.910" style="s2">the false impact is the devil comes to</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.300" end="01:37:38.110" style="s2">vows to as a</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.910" end="01:37:41.140" style="s2">men who aspires to know everything have</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.110" end="01:37:43.240" style="s2">absolute knowledge and he he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.140" end="01:37:47.650" style="s2">satisfied with anything I can get no</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.240" end="01:37:51.760" style="s2">satisfaction right so he makes a pact</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.650" end="01:37:57.430" style="s2">with the devil to achieve first of all</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.760" end="01:37:59.830" style="s2">youth and then also to seduce a young</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.430" end="01:38:03.270" style="s2">woman and destroy her life in a so in a</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.830" end="01:38:05.860" style="s2">sense it&#39;s destroyed all for the sake of</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.270" end="01:38:08.740" style="s2">gaining absolute power and knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.860" end="01:38:13.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a story of the will to power if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.740" end="01:38:15.940" style="s2">like and but when you when you read it</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.720" end="01:38:17.560" style="s2">one of one of these texts that are you</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.940" end="01:38:19.390" style="s2">know first of all beautifully written</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.560" end="01:38:21.730" style="s2">and some of the most beautiful chairman</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.390" end="01:38:24.970" style="s2">ever written of course good is it our</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.730" end="01:38:29.590" style="s2">our national poet it&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.970" end="01:38:32.020" style="s2">else that that happens maybe it might</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.590" end="01:38:34.750" style="s2">not there&#39;s something that occurred to</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.020" end="01:38:36.790" style="s2">me over for the first time that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.750" end="01:38:42.940" style="s2">six seven years ago and read it again</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.790" end="01:38:46.240" style="s2">and also saw the play on stage is that</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.940" end="01:38:48.960" style="s2">there is this deep web I think you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.240" end="01:38:53.650" style="s2">say in English this deep web of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.960" end="01:38:57.220" style="s2">that&#39;s not ever but you cannot Google</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.650" end="01:38:59.770" style="s2">that right you could read everything you</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.220" end="01:39:02.050" style="s2">can have the you can scan every single</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.770" end="01:39:05.770" style="s2">book in the world like Google Books</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.050" end="01:39:07.810" style="s2">and no one you cannot pick up on it from</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.770" end="01:39:10.360" style="s2">if you think it&#39;s all just information</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.810" end="01:39:14.110" style="s2">and data there&#39;s something else is</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.360" end="01:39:18.760" style="s2">working its way in history and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.110" end="01:39:22.030" style="s2">sometimes lights up and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.760" end="01:39:24.310" style="s2">need to get close to and to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.030" end="01:39:26.650" style="s2">degree this epoch then it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.310" end="01:39:28.030" style="s2">meaning is never just given meaning was</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.650" end="01:39:31.230" style="s2">never just given this is something I</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.030" end="01:39:34.300" style="s2">wanted to say is well before tonight is</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.230" end="01:39:38.920" style="s2">meeting always has to be found and</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.300" end="01:39:40.870" style="s2">rested from something else from seven if</p>

<p begin="01:39:40.870" end="01:39:45.290" style="s2">then you are as Kant would say you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.390" end="01:39:49.240" style="s2">you are</p>

<p begin="01:39:57.620" end="01:40:03.230" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite sure that now it says then</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.780" end="01:40:06.500" style="s2">you you need to question but being</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.230" end="01:40:10.070" style="s2">remains a question science fagot is a</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.500" end="01:40:12.980" style="s2">question of being but the off is not a</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.230" end="01:40:22.610" style="s2">being is what&#39;s doing the questioning</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.020" end="01:40:26.210" style="s2">right being asks us right that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:40:26.210" end="01:40:34.040" style="s2">closer to to it in the moments off off</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.040" end="01:40:37.340" style="s2">anxiety of facing death of running forth</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.040" end="01:40:40.370" style="s2">towards death as Heidegger says then</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.340" end="01:40:44.210" style="s2">when we deal with what&#39;s mmediately</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.370" end="01:40:46.730" style="s2">there and available yes that because</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.210" end="01:40:50.480" style="s2">then were trapped in a in a presence</p>

<p begin="01:41:00.530" end="01:41:06.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we are we are we are in</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.170" end="01:41:08.360" style="s2">a making an A and an H of making present</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.500" end="01:41:12.680" style="s2">and Heidegger says and being in time</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.360" end="01:41:17.500" style="s2">that if you make everything present then</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.680" end="01:41:21.500" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in in in in an</p>

<p begin="01:41:21.500" end="01:41:28.700" style="s2">yes right there there is no hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.900" end="01:41:31.190" style="s2">don&#39;t need to hear anything you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.700" end="01:41:34.910" style="s2">need to do why because you you have</p>

<p begin="01:43:23.930" end="01:43:27.770" style="s2">they actually they happen in consumed</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.730" end="01:43:29.810" style="s2">and it&#39;s not clear where it comes from</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.770" end="01:43:33.760" style="s2">so it comes out of a consume and if you</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.810" end="01:43:33.760" style="s2">like right right right</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.300" end="01:43:39.670" style="s2">that I just is word as we&#39;re talking I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:43:39.670" end="01:43:52.280" style="s2">just remembering like at least for me</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.920" end="01:43:54.400" style="s2">anyways yeah meaning and mystery are</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.280" end="01:43:57.860" style="s2">like the same almost like the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.400" end="01:44:01.120" style="s2">right yeah so you could you know yeah</p>

<p begin="01:44:01.120" end="01:44:07.460" style="s2">so they&#39;re not the equivalent no</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.220" end="01:44:09.980" style="s2">identical yeah but they are in in this</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.460" end="01:44:12.199" style="s2">beautiful claim</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.980" end="01:44:20.190" style="s2">yeah where</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.199" end="01:44:24.420" style="s2">right look if I just if I Vic it</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.190" end="01:44:27.260" style="s2">I guess even this conversation between</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.420" end="01:44:30.570" style="s2">you know these weirdos here</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.260" end="01:44:33.260" style="s2">someone could someone could write bullet</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.570" end="01:44:36.690" style="s2">points right</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.260" end="01:44:39.199" style="s2">chairman guy says this American guy says</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.690" end="01:44:41.940" style="s2">this right boom boom boom boom boom and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.199" end="01:44:44.460" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have to listen to it yes</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.940" end="01:44:46.710" style="s2">so you&#39;re given the meaning the</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.460" end="01:44:53.219" style="s2">significance of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.710" end="01:44:54.750" style="s2">bullet points but but there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.219" end="01:44:57.570" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s being disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.750" end="01:45:00.540" style="s2">by that you&#39;re just given something yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.570" end="01:45:03.500" style="s2">if you&#39;re given meaning yes and this by</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.540" end="01:45:06.300" style="s2">the way that all of this is the oldest</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.500" end="01:45:08.429" style="s2">problem it&#39;s the cave of claytor</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.300" end="01:45:12.030" style="s2">right all comes back to that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.429" end="01:45:16.380" style="s2">given and this is something how do the</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.030" end="01:45:18.929" style="s2">way that the cave is taught is false</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.380" end="01:45:20.940" style="s2">right could usually so you know does</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.929" end="01:45:23.280" style="s2">just educational he&#39;s just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.940" end="01:45:27.360" style="s2">explain his theory of forms yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.280" end="01:45:29.639" style="s2">other or you know the shadows aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.360" end="01:45:32.280" style="s2">real number no they&#39;re real that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.639" end="01:45:37.159" style="s2">thing shadows are real what but Plato is</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.280" end="01:45:42.030" style="s2">after here is this strange old problem</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.159" end="01:45:48.590" style="s2">that that can be beings that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.030" end="01:45:48.590" style="s2">really beings that have a very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.070" end="01:45:55.440" style="s2">illogical status right and so where we</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.070" end="01:45:57.480" style="s2">are with the case is that Plato to a</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.440" end="01:46:04.130" style="s2">certain degree also traps us in the cave</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.480" end="01:46:08.510" style="s2">and the prisoners anyways they are given</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.130" end="01:46:11.420" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s why they&#39;re prisoners</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.510" end="01:46:14.750" style="s2">they&#39;re imprisoned by their</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.420" end="01:46:19.590" style="s2">unquestioning stance that they assume</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.750" end="01:46:22.199" style="s2">right and all they do is without ever</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.590" end="01:46:24.080" style="s2">asking - so you know there&#39;s concealment</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.199" end="01:46:26.870" style="s2">at work just by the very fact</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.080" end="01:46:28.520" style="s2">they never turn their heads to see</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.870" end="01:46:32.840" style="s2">what&#39;s behind them so that&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.520" end="01:46:35.210" style="s2">level of concealment or a dimension of</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.840" end="01:46:37.880" style="s2">consumed if you like in them they learn</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.210" end="01:46:40.100" style="s2">by heart the shadows that passed them by</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.880" end="01:46:41.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s what structures their world</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.100" end="01:46:43.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where they get their</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.360" end="01:46:46.670" style="s2">so-called meaning from right their</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.940" end="01:46:48.680" style="s2">existence you could say is pointless</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.670" end="01:46:51.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s they don&#39;t ask what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.680" end="01:46:53.750" style="s2">beyond this there&#39;s no transcending</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.440" end="01:46:55.220" style="s2">themselves and trying to leave the cave</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.750" end="01:46:56.900" style="s2">because only one of them who does and he</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.220" end="01:47:02.260" style="s2">faces death when he comes back down</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.900" end="01:47:07.880" style="s2">right yeah faces the death by hanging</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.260" end="01:47:19.490" style="s2">because is he dared to leave ranks right</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.880" end="01:47:21.200" style="s2">let&#39;s be very careful it&#39;s so to a</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.490" end="01:47:23.890" style="s2">certain degree we&#39;re not saying anything</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.200" end="01:47:30.980" style="s2">new because it&#39;s always the problem</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.890" end="01:47:33.230" style="s2">but what Plato escaped when I was six 15</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.980" end="01:47:35.330" style="s2">maybe 16 I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.230" end="01:47:41.270" style="s2">whenever I read it first and I read it</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.330" end="01:47:43.040" style="s2">in Greek at school back then already</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.270" end="01:47:45.980" style="s2">this is almost twenty years ago it hit</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.040" end="01:47:50.330" style="s2">me that this is our age how is it</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.980" end="01:47:56.240" style="s2">possible that a thinker 400 before</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.330" end="01:48:04.820" style="s2">Christ or so describes television radio</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.240" end="01:48:05.510" style="s2">and the computer cinema how is that</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.820" end="01:48:10.150" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.510" end="01:48:12.860" style="s2">so you see maybe maybe maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.150" end="01:48:18.050" style="s2">way of of getting into this</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.860" end="01:48:21.950" style="s2">understanding of how history works yes</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.050" end="01:48:24.290" style="s2">it again so how is it that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.950" end="01:48:29.660" style="s2">an open question yeah oh is is that</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.290" end="01:48:34.480" style="s2">Plato describes something that you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.660" end="01:48:37.699" style="s2">it reminds us today of television of</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.480" end="01:48:41.780" style="s2">cinema we have yes</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.699" end="01:48:43.900" style="s2">now certainly also smartphones and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.780" end="01:48:48.320" style="s2">internet right</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.900" end="01:48:50.449" style="s2">well we deal with shadows yes these</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.320" end="01:48:53.750" style="s2">shadows are real they make up our world</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.449" end="01:48:55.910" style="s2">we scroll through Instagram and all oh I</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.750" end="01:48:58.820" style="s2">want to be here I want to be this I want</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.910" end="01:49:00.920" style="s2">to go there yes they structure how we</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.820" end="01:49:05.570" style="s2">see the world so you see the shadows are</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.920" end="01:49:08.080" style="s2">extremely powerful right people who</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.570" end="01:49:12.050" style="s2">spend their lives staring at screens</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.080" end="01:49:14.510" style="s2">trading whatever that that&#39;s unreal to a</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.050" end="01:49:20.840" style="s2">certain degree that&#39;s put it then again</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.510" end="01:49:23.140" style="s2">it is it&#39;s so what&#39;s I think the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.840" end="01:49:27.890" style="s2">open question here is how is it that</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.140" end="01:49:36.460" style="s2">what is history if if not</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.890" end="01:49:43.460" style="s2">this slow wave crashing or not crashing</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.460" end="01:49:45.740" style="s2">waves moving from behind us and coming</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.460" end="01:49:49.430" style="s2">at us from from behind I mean the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.740" end="01:49:52.430" style="s2">cave is only just now coming towards us</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.430" end="01:49:55.520" style="s2">yeah don&#39;t mind but towards us because</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.430" end="01:49:57.470" style="s2">we now have to deal with it yes on any</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.520" end="01:50:19.970" style="s2">level that no one else has to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.470" end="01:50:21.030" style="s2">before right right so interesting I had</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.970" end="01:50:24.140" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.030" end="01:50:24.140" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.940" end="01:50:34.479" style="s2">actually I wanted to ask you two about</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.110" end="01:50:35.769" style="s2">this about</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.479" end="01:50:42.449" style="s2">one of the things he talked about last</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.769" end="01:50:42.449" style="s2">time was how how academia was awful</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.219" end="01:50:51.369" style="s2">and I would have thought you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.170" end="01:50:53.199" style="s2">interesting I would have thought that</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.369" end="01:50:56.050" style="s2">the kind of conversation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.199" end="01:50:58.119" style="s2">having right um</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.050" end="01:50:59.409" style="s2">I think without even reflecting on it I</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.119" end="01:51:01.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t really even think about it but I</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.409" end="01:51:04.570" style="s2">just I was surprised when he talked</p>

<p begin="01:51:04.570" end="01:51:14.039" style="s2">like connecting and this way was rare</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.880" end="01:51:19.380" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s it&#39;s rare because</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.039" end="01:51:24.179" style="s2">there&#39;s no competition there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.380" end="01:51:27.579" style="s2">there&#39;s just an interest in talking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.179" end="01:51:32.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking to you to overpower you</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.579" end="01:51:34.989" style="s2">and show you that I&#39;m right yeah and or</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.010" end="01:51:37.300" style="s2">that or the other way around or even</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.989" end="01:51:39.789" style="s2">just to teach you something I mean I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:52:11.739" end="01:52:18.479" style="s2">taught Heidegger in a particular way</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.530" end="01:52:20.769" style="s2">that people didn&#39;t necessarily like</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.479" end="01:52:22.440" style="s2">agree that that&#39;s the way they should be</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.769" end="01:52:26.079" style="s2">taught in that way</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.440" end="01:52:29.650" style="s2">what was well how does doubted eat I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:52:53.710" end="01:53:01.570" style="s2">alone like trying to read Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.290" end="01:53:03.100" style="s2">I haven&#39;t really had anyone to talk to I</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.570" end="01:53:04.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know how people approach it like</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.100" end="01:53:06.640" style="s2">this one of the things I like about</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.720" end="01:53:08.080" style="s2">YouTube is that like there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.640" end="01:53:10.780" style="s2">people is the first time I actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.080" end="01:53:15.610" style="s2">heard people discuss Heidegger in some</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.780" end="01:53:19.720" style="s2">sense right and like yeah but like when</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.610" end="01:53:22.360" style="s2">you was it when you started to engage</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.720" end="01:53:25.900" style="s2">with with Heidegger was it was it with</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.360" end="01:53:27.640" style="s2">him in India in the university can you</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.900" end="01:53:29.860" style="s2">share like what was that like for you</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.640" end="01:53:33.670" style="s2">like to a certain degree he never</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.860" end="01:53:38.140" style="s2">mentioned the name Heidegger he because</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.670" end="01:53:41.950" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter yeah and the way</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.140" end="01:53:44.530" style="s2">though he it was that thinking is not</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.950" end="01:53:46.870" style="s2">hiding us thinking it&#39;s what if I had</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.530" end="01:53:52.540" style="s2">ancient Greek and Latin at school yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.870" end="01:53:54.670" style="s2">and especially the I was you know I was</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.540" end="01:53:57.970" style="s2">better in ancient Greek than in Latin</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.670" end="01:54:02.020" style="s2">yeah because the Greek way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.970" end="01:54:05.230" style="s2">is closer to me than Roman thought Roman</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.020" end="01:54:07.930" style="s2">thought is very superficial it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.230" end="01:54:13.510" style="s2">about decorum it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;re copycats</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.930" end="01:54:16.780" style="s2">basically of Greek culture anyways and</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.510" end="01:54:21.610" style="s2">you know very theatrical as Italians are</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.780" end="01:54:26.440" style="s2">up until this day it&#39;s all theatrical</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.610" end="01:54:31.720" style="s2">everything&#39;s dramatical and the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.440" end="01:54:40.180" style="s2">serious about it but not really yes</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.720" end="01:54:43.570" style="s2">yeah fascinating that&#39;s English but so</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.180" end="01:54:48.220" style="s2">that when you did you know taught</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.570" end="01:54:53.229" style="s2">philosophy that way of thinking that I</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.220" end="01:54:56.409" style="s2">had become familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.229" end="01:54:59.889" style="s2">in studying Greek the language came back</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.409" end="01:55:03.369" style="s2">hmm did you have to mention hiding his</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.889" end="01:55:06.159" style="s2">name so what I make of that hmm is that</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.369" end="01:55:07.900" style="s2">the way Heidegger thinks isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.159" end="01:55:11.409" style="s2">oh it&#39;s erratically different and you</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.900" end="01:55:14.019" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s just the way that Greeks</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.409" end="01:55:19.449" style="s2">think and the way that ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.019" end="01:55:22.539" style="s2">thought worked mmm how thinking itself</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.449" end="01:55:24.699" style="s2">work since the question of being is not</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.539" end="01:55:27.099" style="s2">all of this world it&#39;s a question for</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.699" end="01:55:30.099" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s a question for existence</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.099" end="01:55:32.050" style="s2">yeah question of history and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.099" end="01:55:34.119" style="s2">reminding us that there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.050" end="01:55:35.530" style="s2">beyond that you know not beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.119" end="01:55:37.840" style="s2">middle physical sense that but you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.530" end="01:55:40.869" style="s2">we&#39;re not grasping at the moment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.840" end="01:55:42.789" style="s2">not even working for right and and the</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.869" end="01:55:44.530" style="s2">other thing with with with you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.789" end="01:55:47.469" style="s2">teaching hiding it it&#39;s just what I</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.530" end="01:55:51.880" style="s2">would say is the question is do you take</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.469" end="01:55:55.630" style="s2">it seriously what do you use it to as an</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.880" end="01:55:57.940" style="s2">ornament or as as sort of a a good way</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.630" end="01:56:01.269" style="s2">to start an academic career right</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.940" end="01:56:03.729" style="s2">someone to argue with right I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.269" end="01:56:06.340" style="s2">a high to get critically yes you can you</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.729" end="01:56:06.670" style="s2">can anyone critically that anyone can do</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.340" end="01:56:08.949" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.670" end="01:56:11.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s waiting I mean I can sit</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.949" end="01:56:14.679" style="s2">down and say ha ha Eagle mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.440" end="01:56:16.630" style="s2">you&#39;re this doesn&#39;t make any sense and</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.679" end="01:56:22.300" style="s2">know what you&#39;re trying to do when you</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.630" end="01:56:26.590" style="s2">think is you approach it from the from</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.300" end="01:56:31.179" style="s2">the perspective of necessity there is</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.590" end="01:56:34.420" style="s2">necessity Hegel coming along after after</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.179" end="01:56:36.219" style="s2">Kant who speaks and the critique of Pure</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.420" end="01:56:38.320" style="s2">Reason about the antennae Me&#39;s agrees</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.219" end="01:56:41.920" style="s2">that means that reason itself cannot</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.320" end="01:56:43.989" style="s2">miss that reason always traps itself in</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.920" end="01:56:45.610" style="s2">contradictions but then once to get rid</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.989" end="01:56:47.949" style="s2">of the contradictions you know what</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.610" end="01:56:50.499" style="s2">technology is technology is the</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.949" end="01:56:54.989" style="s2">transcendental logic by which we</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.499" end="01:56:57.670" style="s2">construct subjectively non contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.989" end="01:57:00.969" style="s2">without contradictions that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.670" end="01:57:03.189" style="s2">everything&#39;s so boring we are all bloody</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.969" end="01:57:05.850" style="s2">transcendental largest locations</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.189" end="01:57:11.640" style="s2">according to the laws that can</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.850" end="01:57:14.040" style="s2">finds finds establishes but finds in the</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.640" end="01:57:16.080" style="s2">possibilities of nature in history yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.040" end="01:57:19.590" style="s2">and then Eagle says you can&#39;t look you</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.080" end="01:57:21.360" style="s2">he says look a malleable you do admit</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.590" end="01:57:23.100" style="s2">that there are contradictions - let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.360" end="01:57:26.070" style="s2">take them seriously and that&#39;s why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.100" end="01:57:29.220" style="s2">a classical thinker yes and right ouch</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.070" end="01:57:34.980" style="s2">huh this is to arrive at truth you need</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.220" end="01:57:36.990" style="s2">to have being a nothing that&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.980" end="01:57:38.520" style="s2">then Heidi is another necessity we can</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.990" end="01:57:40.830" style="s2">talk about that some other time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.520" end="01:57:43.050" style="s2">just if you take it seriously this</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.830" end="01:57:45.770" style="s2">thinking then there&#39;s a necessity to it</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.050" end="01:57:50.190" style="s2">the way we approach it now in this hyper</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.770" end="01:57:52.080" style="s2">intellectual world we live in it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.190" end="01:57:54.720" style="s2">just you know theories just something to</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.080" end="01:57:57.270" style="s2">to read critically or to write a paper</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.720" end="01:57:59.040" style="s2">about that&#39;s interesting then how do you</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.270" end="01:58:02.310" style="s2">assess some ways as you know everything</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.040" end="01:58:04.110" style="s2">is interesting today but what does it</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.310" end="01:58:05.940" style="s2">even mean to say it something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.110" end="01:58:07.710" style="s2">interesting right it means nothing</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.940" end="01:58:09.210" style="s2">Nietzsche says and I quote this in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.710" end="01:58:11.460" style="s2">lecture he says we&#39;re all interested</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.210" end="01:58:13.950" style="s2">we&#39;re all just epidermal e interested</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.460" end="01:58:16.050" style="s2">nothing touches us really doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.950" end="01:58:19.010" style="s2">under a skin rock he says what are you</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.050" end="01:58:22.440" style="s2">repeating says spectators historians</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.010" end="01:58:24.570" style="s2">interpreters all reactive talents</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.440" end="01:58:26.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not active they&#39;re not acting</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.570" end="01:58:29.400" style="s2">not trying to build and create we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.760" end="01:58:33.090" style="s2">trying to just respond and respect you</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.400" end="01:58:35.160" style="s2">know look at something and then react to</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.090" end="01:58:38.940" style="s2">it and that&#39;s kind of comfortable I know</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.160" end="01:58:41.550" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.940" end="01:58:46.650" style="s2">weird because you know it transform you</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.550" end="01:58:48.180" style="s2">yeah yeah right totally it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.650" end="01:58:58.760" style="s2">understand it&#39;s the thing I think about</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.180" end="01:59:00.320" style="s2">I think about with reading I mean</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.760" end="01:59:04.040" style="s2">most of the continental philosophers I</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.320" end="01:59:06.260" style="s2">mean definitely Heidegger like um I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.040" end="01:59:07.730" style="s2">understood it&#39;s weird it&#39;s like it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.260" end="01:59:12.860" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.730" end="01:59:17.180" style="s2">what I what what hangs with me or where</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.860" end="01:59:20.930" style="s2">um well actually you know who talked</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.180" end="01:59:24.100" style="s2">about this was uh which his name he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.930" end="01:59:27.860" style="s2">the Acala he&#39;s the cybernetic guy um</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.100" end="01:59:28.880" style="s2">Gregory Bateson and he talked about like</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.860" end="01:59:31.580" style="s2">the difference between like a</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.880" end="01:59:33.950" style="s2">blockbuster movie and an art movie an</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.580" end="01:59:35.540" style="s2">artful movie and what and what he would</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.950" end="01:59:38.180" style="s2">say is like you know when you go into a</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.540" end="01:59:38.390" style="s2">blockbuster movie right you go in one</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.180" end="01:59:42.020" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.390" end="01:59:44.570" style="s2">great and then there&#39;s like the right</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.020" end="01:59:47.720" style="s2">the opening and then the build-up right</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.570" end="01:59:50.720" style="s2">and attention and then the crescendo and</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.720" end="01:59:53.330" style="s2">the orgasm and then the happy ending and</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.720" end="01:59:58.340" style="s2">then and then you walk out exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.330" end="02:00:01.130" style="s2">same person right and where he said the</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.340" end="02:00:05.330" style="s2">more artful a movie is is the more you</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.130" end="02:00:09.410" style="s2">walk in one way and the movie opens up</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.330" end="02:00:11.810" style="s2">these tensions right and to the degree</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.410" end="02:00:15.020" style="s2">it&#39;s artful as he would put it it should</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.810" end="02:00:17.960" style="s2">agree that by the end you&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.020" end="02:00:19.820" style="s2">something unsolved with the tension</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.960" end="02:00:22.850" style="s2">that&#39;s there&#39;s an ink there&#39;s no like</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.820" end="02:00:27.440" style="s2">crescendo and dude it&#39;s like you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.850" end="02:00:31.250" style="s2">with unresolved things such that you</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.440" end="02:00:33.460" style="s2">walk out right and you actually have to</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.250" end="02:00:37.300" style="s2">kind of live the completion of the movie</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.460" end="02:00:40.010" style="s2">right so you walk out a different person</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.300" end="02:00:42.650" style="s2">know the difference that our horizons</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.010" end="02:00:47.330" style="s2">and I I think that that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.650" end="02:00:49.370" style="s2">I really where I find you know we talk</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.330" end="02:00:50.750" style="s2">about well what are some ways of getting</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.370" end="02:00:54.410" style="s2">access to this kind of ecstatic</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.750" end="02:00:56.780" style="s2">temporality and</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.410" end="02:00:58.820" style="s2">um which I actually think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.780" end="02:01:03.200" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s a listening for</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.820" end="02:01:05.330" style="s2">that right there&#39;s a there&#39;s a loser</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.200" end="02:01:08.270" style="s2">listening and a desire to have like an</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.330" end="02:01:11.780" style="s2">experience of that right what what is it</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.270" end="02:01:14.600" style="s2">- what is it - live time or to be that</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.780" end="02:01:18.280" style="s2">by a kind of time or a different sense</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.600" end="02:01:22.790" style="s2">of time I mean that is just yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.280" end="02:01:26.960" style="s2">really like yes that&#39;s it exactly I</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.790" end="02:01:30.430" style="s2">think it begins for us as humans it</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.960" end="02:01:34.480" style="s2">begins in language as it stirred me a</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.430" end="02:01:37.100" style="s2">certain carefulness but how do you speak</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.480" end="02:01:40.250" style="s2">and you know not say I don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.100" end="02:01:50.090" style="s2">all right you never have time first of</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.250" end="02:01:54.410" style="s2">all just happy right you cannot save</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.090" end="02:01:56.180" style="s2">time what does that even mean right</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.410" end="02:02:00.110" style="s2">show me that bank account where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.180" end="02:02:05.000" style="s2">saved time and that&#39;s not there so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.110" end="02:02:05.360" style="s2">not a stock but then you take or save or</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.000" end="02:02:08.810" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.360" end="02:02:11.450" style="s2">no let me just not use time for now no</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.810" end="02:02:14.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not my work so tippy if we only</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.450" end="02:02:16.880" style="s2">speak in terms of times passing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.150" end="02:02:19.910" style="s2">passing me by all the time and yep don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.880" end="02:02:21.470" style="s2">worry let&#39;s just say and this is</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.910" end="02:02:22.700" style="s2">something that&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.470" end="02:02:24.110" style="s2">because we always want to have you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.700" end="02:02:27.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the result what&#39;s the outcome</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.110" end="02:02:29.530" style="s2">what&#39;s projected once I was it true okay</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.080" end="02:02:35.650" style="s2">what was the correspondence true that</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.530" end="02:02:42.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a time arises and gifts itself</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.650" end="02:02:47.830" style="s2">time gifts itself time gives us what we</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.950" end="02:02:51.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t just I think that in itself is</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.830" end="02:02:55.220" style="s2">transformative all right he keep telling</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.020" end="02:02:57.200" style="s2">that yourself I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m certainly not</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.220" end="02:02:58.970" style="s2">doing that every day right kids</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.200" end="02:03:01.310" style="s2">something I actually remind myself off</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.970" end="02:03:04.670" style="s2">as well right because we live in clock</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.310" end="02:03:06.890" style="s2">time yeah we just think yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.670" end="02:03:07.820" style="s2">actually hey give me that&#39;s you know not</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.890" end="02:03:09.679" style="s2">tie times</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.820" end="02:03:11.540" style="s2">not take that&#39;s stupid that&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.679" end="02:03:15.409" style="s2">leave that people make oh we&#39;ve invented</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.540" end="02:03:16.579" style="s2">clock so we should meant a time no no</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.409" end="02:03:19.520" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.579" end="02:03:21.530" style="s2">mine is a bit bigger than you but clock</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.520" end="02:03:23.960" style="s2">time to certainly agree is fake you</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.530" end="02:03:26.000" style="s2">cannot equalize time you know this is</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.960" end="02:03:29.060" style="s2">why you get to all these shenanigans</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.000" end="02:03:29.810" style="s2">about high time is relative on how it</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.060" end="02:03:32.780" style="s2">feels</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.810" end="02:03:34.159" style="s2">yes but it&#39;s not time is relative</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.780" end="02:03:35.989" style="s2">because if it&#39;s relative then it would</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.159" end="02:03:39.619" style="s2">be relative to some absolutely not some</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.989" end="02:03:41.719" style="s2">what&#39;s happened some time is that I</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.619" end="02:03:44.810" style="s2">think for now I have to think a lot more</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.719" end="02:03:49.820" style="s2">about time I think what an exercise can</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.810" end="02:03:53.300" style="s2">be is that one says time arises time</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.820" end="02:03:56.719" style="s2">gives yeah and get a gig and then move</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.300" end="02:03:59.840" style="s2">away from saying time is passing just a</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.719" end="02:04:03.710" style="s2">time rice and that that is I you know</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.840" end="02:04:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s beginning to transform into beyond</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.710" end="02:04:12.349" style="s2">it it feels when I say it there&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.280" end="02:04:14.719" style="s2">a sense of of I know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.349" end="02:04:18.739" style="s2">soothing even this it&#39;s very really is</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.719" end="02:04:21.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t it yeah it&#39;s like passes but am I</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.739" end="02:04:23.510" style="s2">gonna running out I need to go get some</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.800" end="02:04:25.760" style="s2">more time give me some more time</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.510" end="02:04:28.250" style="s2">somewhere or you know I don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.760" end="02:04:32.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s gone it&#39;s it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.250" end="02:04:34.400" style="s2">yep the time arises time gears right is</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.360" end="02:04:37.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a quietness that comes over a</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.400" end="02:04:39.920" style="s2">certain column yeah I start to like list</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.250" end="02:04:46.250" style="s2">I start to to yeah I start to listen for</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.920" end="02:04:56.840" style="s2">the silent note yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.250" end="02:04:59.210" style="s2">Pingree yes yes yeah that I was thinking</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.840" end="02:05:03.110" style="s2">about likes of my experience in this you</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.210" end="02:05:05.000" style="s2">mentioned Goethe and Faust Grinnell you</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.110" end="02:05:09.579" style="s2">with Goethe through his scientific work</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.000" end="02:05:16.030" style="s2">which is just wild gray just</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.579" end="02:05:17.619" style="s2">factors a guy created new sciences I</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.030" end="02:05:19.119" style="s2">just like it and also I heard I heard</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.619" end="02:05:21.309" style="s2">somewhere that like Garrett that has</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.119" end="02:05:25.149" style="s2">like somehow they&#39;re able to measure</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.309" end="02:05:27.530" style="s2">this but like Goethe has has used more</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.149" end="02:05:30.400" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.530" end="02:05:33.440" style="s2">in his lifetime than any other person</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.400" end="02:05:35.060" style="s2">like they did some sunless it was</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.440" end="02:05:37.970" style="s2">interesting of like you know I think it</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.060" end="02:05:40.370" style="s2">was about genius and language and yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.970" end="02:05:43.960" style="s2">they showed like that you know and the</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.370" end="02:05:46.070" style="s2">person below him was like 40 you know</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.960" end="02:05:49.430" style="s2">40,000 and Goethe was something like a</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.070" end="02:05:53.840" style="s2">hundred and fifty thousand right Garrett</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.430" end="02:05:56.510" style="s2">is fascinating to me um just the RET</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.840" end="02:06:01.700" style="s2">like the range at which he he operated</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.510" end="02:06:07.810" style="s2">but so my understanding of like what his</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.700" end="02:06:11.450" style="s2">work with biology right was was</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.810" end="02:06:13.280" style="s2">analogous to reading a text you know</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.450" end="02:06:16.760" style="s2">you&#39;d say that you know and for the most</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.280" end="02:06:21.560" style="s2">part when we look at you know human</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.760" end="02:06:25.430" style="s2">human-made objects we actually don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.560" end="02:06:28.940" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t uh look at them and</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.430" end="02:06:32.060" style="s2">perceive them we read them like we we</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.940" end="02:06:35.180" style="s2">net we see a chair because we we read</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.060" end="02:06:37.330" style="s2">the functionality of chairs and because</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.180" end="02:06:40.670" style="s2">we have the correlating distinction</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.330" end="02:06:43.250" style="s2">right we can we can see the chair we</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.670" end="02:06:47.600" style="s2">actually read it right and so just like</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.250" end="02:06:49.280" style="s2">with the reading you don&#39;t you know and</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.600" end="02:06:51.470" style="s2">he said he said so so like in the human</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.280" end="02:06:54.230" style="s2">in the human world there&#39;s this way in</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.470" end="02:06:56.630" style="s2">which we have the corollary cons as he</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.230" end="02:07:00.020" style="s2">would say the concept meets the precept</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.630" end="02:07:03.140" style="s2">right and that that those coming</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.020" end="02:07:08.030" style="s2">together is the is the experience of the</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.140" end="02:07:11.600" style="s2">world this is a but that it was he said</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.030" end="02:07:16.420" style="s2">however with nature right he said we</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.600" end="02:07:19.520" style="s2">don&#39;t how we try to understand nature is</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.420" end="02:07:21.860" style="s2">not by reading it right how we try to</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.520" end="02:07:23.450" style="s2">understand nature is bike as if we were</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.860" end="02:07:25.210" style="s2">like opening a text and we were</p>

<p begin="02:07:25.210" end="02:07:32.750" style="s2">right like because we don&#39;t and so I</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.410" end="02:07:37.570" style="s2">think the thing that he was the Talos</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.750" end="02:07:37.570" style="s2">that he was approaching what this was</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.990" end="02:07:48.100" style="s2">seeing nature as a sacred text and that</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.210" end="02:07:50.750" style="s2">that to give one&#39;s like to give one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.100" end="02:07:56.360" style="s2">perception it&#39;s actually to give one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.750" end="02:07:58.250" style="s2">eye right over to nature and that if you</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.360" end="02:08:00.170" style="s2">could fully give it over to nature and</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.250" end="02:08:03.220" style="s2">he had this whole way of doing this of</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.170" end="02:08:07.190" style="s2">like how do you perceive the species</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.220" end="02:08:09.200" style="s2">right of like in botany like that the</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.190" end="02:08:11.960" style="s2">actual Sun like the revelation of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.200" end="02:08:17.210" style="s2">science that we would be able to like</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.960" end="02:08:20.540" style="s2">fully give over your sense of I am to</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.210" end="02:08:23.270" style="s2">nature and that if if you could if you</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.540" end="02:08:28.010" style="s2">could fully discipline your perception</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.270" end="02:08:30.320" style="s2">in that giving you light up right it</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.010" end="02:08:32.120" style="s2">would you&#39;d experience it&#39;s in a certain</p>

<p begin="02:08:34.670" end="02:08:41.450" style="s2">you could perceive the that which runs</p>

<p begin="02:10:06.020" end="02:10:13.550" style="s2">reading the Eastern Rite of Heidegger</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.630" end="02:10:16.850" style="s2">and the first opening so I read I read</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.550" end="02:10:18.500" style="s2">the poem right which I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.850" end="02:10:21.290" style="s2">understand it and I felt like I really</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.500" end="02:10:24.679" style="s2">had to even I would have to I&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.290" end="02:10:26.300" style="s2">go over that a thousand times - so I</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.679" end="02:10:27.860" style="s2">think where I could actually begin to</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.300" end="02:10:30.830" style="s2">comprehend what he&#39;s talking about there</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.860" end="02:10:35.330" style="s2">were little moments of like like when he</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.830" end="02:10:38.659" style="s2">talked about sign somehow bringing in</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.330" end="02:10:41.330" style="s2">the Sun and the moon and the horizon I</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.659" end="02:10:44.270" style="s2">was like oh that&#39;s something shakes</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.330" end="02:10:47.840" style="s2">there a little bit but then but then</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.270" end="02:10:50.870" style="s2">like the opening paragraph I was</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.840" end="02:10:53.300" style="s2">noticing my experience of reading it</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.870" end="02:10:55.639" style="s2">right in my experience of reading it was</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.300" end="02:10:58.760" style="s2">where and this is where I feel so</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.639" end="02:11:00.739" style="s2">grateful for Heidegger like I just feel</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.760" end="02:11:02.980" style="s2">so much gratitude for him because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.739" end="02:11:02.980" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.140" end="02:11:08.210" style="s2">whether or not I&#39;m getting the content</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.150" end="02:11:11.690" style="s2">of what he&#39;s saying in order to try to</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.210" end="02:11:14.090" style="s2">get it what he&#39;s and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.690" end="02:11:17.920" style="s2">what&#39;s so interesting about him in my</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.090" end="02:11:17.920" style="s2">view is that</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.359" end="02:11:24.039" style="s2">what makes it difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.089" end="02:11:26.559" style="s2">his because he&#39;s bringing my attention</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.039" end="02:11:30.280" style="s2">to a place that is nearer that I</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.559" end="02:11:33.849" style="s2">normally look right it&#39;s like a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.280" end="02:11:37.499" style="s2">this complex complicated thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.849" end="02:11:37.499" style="s2">actually is just talking about the</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.679" end="02:11:46.719" style="s2">the colleague is talk called a opening</p>

<p begin="02:12:18.070" end="02:12:23.590" style="s2">come at some point it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.050" end="02:12:27.360" style="s2">lingering it&#39;s something very simple and</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.590" end="02:12:30.520" style="s2">very simple and it&#39;s not you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.360" end="02:12:35.620" style="s2">beyond an anywhere else but this strange</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.520" end="02:12:38.110" style="s2">thing is and to quote Mazda eka why I</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.620" end="02:12:40.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;ve got him a closeness and</p>

<p begin="02:12:40.300" end="02:12:46.679" style="s2">where my second says it actually but</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.010" end="02:12:53.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the line goes Wow why do you go out</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.679" end="02:12:57.670" style="s2">home so we would you have to go out and</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.640" end="02:13:02.020" style="s2">leave ourselves as work but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.670" end="02:13:04.540" style="s2">already there where we need to be but</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.020" end="02:13:07.900" style="s2">still we have to go out and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.540" end="02:13:09.940" style="s2">sort of difference self at work and that</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.900" end="02:13:15.370" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have said that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.940" end="02:13:18.429" style="s2">have you like and it seems like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.370" end="02:13:20.230" style="s2">a kind of a yoga that like and following</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.429" end="02:13:22.920" style="s2">just kind of following the movement of</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.230" end="02:13:26.199" style="s2">understanding yes</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.920" end="02:13:30.520" style="s2">it just kept having me get closer in</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.199" end="02:13:35.940" style="s2">closer in closer in right in that that</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.520" end="02:13:35.940" style="s2">is seems like in in some way</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.309" end="02:13:41.829" style="s2">you&#39;re right it&#39;s like oh yeah I get it</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.409" end="02:13:44.019" style="s2">and then it slips away right and I have</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.829" end="02:13:47.349" style="s2">to read it again and but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.019" end="02:13:49.989" style="s2">kind of sense of kidding really close in</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.349" end="02:13:54.760" style="s2">like closer and closer and closer and</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.989" end="02:13:57.099" style="s2">closer and closer um which I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.760" end="02:14:00.309" style="s2">about is that I I think that has just</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.099" end="02:14:02.589" style="s2">been so instructive for me right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.309" end="02:14:04.569" style="s2">almost like where I feel immersed</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.589" end="02:14:06.129" style="s2">Aponte&#39;s really like this to a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.569" end="02:14:09.039" style="s2">the Continental people are like really</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.129" end="02:14:13.719" style="s2">like this but like um huntys really cool</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.039" end="02:14:18.099" style="s2">in so many ways he really is like that</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.719" end="02:14:21.339" style="s2">too but this sense of just where it</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.099" end="02:14:25.059" style="s2">seems like it seems like where it brings</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.339" end="02:14:28.209" style="s2">my attention right is like the</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.059" end="02:14:31.599" style="s2">discipline or something or like the or</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.209" end="02:14:33.069" style="s2">the practice of philosophy right of how</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.599" end="02:14:35.309" style="s2">to live it like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.069" end="02:14:37.899" style="s2">the way that you have to read it right</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.309" end="02:14:39.729" style="s2">and then I&#39;m thinking good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.899" end="02:14:43.059" style="s2">something about that and the way that</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.729" end="02:14:45.879" style="s2">Garrett is talking about like reading</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.059" end="02:14:48.010" style="s2">nature as a kind of sacred text and</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.879" end="02:14:53.579" style="s2">giving yourself over to it fully and</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.010" end="02:15:00.419" style="s2">having it those kinds of right yeah sure</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.579" end="02:15:04.659" style="s2">it&#39;s um my wife is just got home oh okay</p>

<p begin="02:15:36.099" end="02:15:41.169" style="s2">I meant to write this I have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.010" end="02:15:45.129" style="s2">ideas about things that I think would be</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.169" end="02:15:50.720" style="s2">really interesting to do um also with an</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.129" end="02:15:52.850" style="s2">eye on just wanting I I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.720" end="02:15:54.890" style="s2">I want I want you to have what you want</p>
