<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:18.180" style="s2">Kallstrom I&#39;m very happy to have here</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.690" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">pissed me shorten Hall Jordan hello to</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.180" end="00:00:28.970" style="s2">revolve Jordan you are here right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.970" style="s2">its morning time your time in California</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.000" end="00:00:35.149" style="s2">thank you very much for joining really</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">evolved invited here because you are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.149" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">very known thinker in certain circles</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">for a new complex complexity oriented</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on right</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">now in the world and you also has a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">particular perspective of something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">you call a meta-crisis a meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">that&#39;s much more than the corona crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:02.370" style="s2">that we are in I think it&#39;s also much</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">more than the economic and financial</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:10.280" style="s2">crisis that we aim and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">certain insights that I find are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.280" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">important just to hear in the discuss</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">because maybe that describes something</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">of the background of the situation that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">we are in or at least allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">discuss the backgrounds of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">between because everyone is very focused</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">on a virus at this point at the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">time we are very aware that our</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">financial situation is in a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">situation and most of us are very aware</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">that our ecological crisis has not gone</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">anywhere but it seems to be that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">these different layers of crisis a part</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">of one big picture and the term that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">are using meta crisis also talks to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">that there is more than just the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">that we see and it would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">this commercial conversation started</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">with the question um when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">a meta crisis that we in what are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:18.460" style="s2">well maybe it seems to me that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.580" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">that I would like to try is to is to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.460" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">somewhat deep into that question but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:26.770" style="s2">seems to me before before we can go very</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">deep perhaps we should begin by doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.770" end="00:02:34.030" style="s2">some small things that are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">easier you mentioned for example that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.030" end="00:02:41.110" style="s2">there seems to be something more</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:43.390" style="s2">profound going on than just a virus for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.110" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">example and then you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.390" end="00:02:45.460" style="s2">there&#39;s some of them seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:49.240" style="s2">something more profound going on than</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.460" end="00:02:52.240" style="s2">just a financial crisis or just an</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.240" end="00:02:55.690" style="s2">economic crisis or the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.240" end="00:02:57.010" style="s2">among these three things okay but Babb</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.690" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">begins to move this from the direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.010" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">of the notion of a meta crisis that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:10.180" style="s2">the insight or the premise is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:16.690" style="s2">if we scratch at the surface of most of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.180" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">the the kinds of systems that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">use to make society work things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:34.780" style="s2">education or food or urban design or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:37.580" style="s2">parenting and family or money we will</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.780" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">begin to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.580" end="00:03:43.870" style="s2">most of them infected many many in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:43.870" style="s2">ways all of them have</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.610" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">significant challenges which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.650" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">what I would say is that they are they</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:04:00.410" style="s2">are close to they are vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:04:01.820" style="s2">being in a state of of crisis and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.410" end="00:04:04.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the first part so the first part</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.820" end="00:04:07.550" style="s2">is that that most or all of our social</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.310" end="00:04:14.200" style="s2">systems are close to being in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.550" end="00:04:18.169" style="s2">crisis and this fact is is implicative</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.200" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">meaning as we&#39;ve seen these these</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.169" end="00:04:27.560" style="s2">systems are not isolated they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:30.430" style="s2">connected to each other and a an event</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.560" end="00:04:33.950" style="s2">that occurs like for example say a virus</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.430" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">that comes in and and hits us at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.950" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">medical level spills over into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">financial level spills over into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:49.400" style="s2">political level spills over into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:53.060" style="s2">psychological domain and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">fragility the the lack of richness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.060" end="00:04:58.490" style="s2">robustness in each of the subsystems is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">made all the more significant by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.490" end="00:05:05.690" style="s2">fact of their being so tightly connected</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">such that what might ordinarily be only</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.690" end="00:05:11.810" style="s2">a minor crisis in one area may in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">become a Christ it&#39;s a larger crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.810" end="00:05:14.990" style="s2">another area which then may in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:18.290" style="s2">spill back to the first so you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.990" end="00:05:25.490" style="s2">feedback loops in complexity this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.290" end="00:05:27.050" style="s2">called a cascade failure maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.490" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">bit more on that because we can use some</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.050" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">nice visual metaphors if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:36.770" style="s2">visualize taking an hourglass and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">turning it upside down and watching the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:42.590" style="s2">sand fall you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:45.290" style="s2">witnessed if you&#39;ve ever done that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.590" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">the grains of sand tend to pile on top</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.290" end="00:05:52.729" style="s2">of each other and pile on top of each</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:55.640" style="s2">other and until all at once there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.729" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">avalanche of some magnitude and big</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.640" end="00:05:58.490" style="s2">chunks that same will slide down and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.490" end="00:06:01.940" style="s2">pile and pile and big chunks of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">stainless lie down now if you look very</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.940" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">closely what actually happened there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.419" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">a weight building and there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:11.630" style="s2">sand particles that are sitting on top</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.190" end="00:06:14.449" style="s2">of other sand particles with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.630" end="00:06:15.740" style="s2">amount of friction holding them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.449" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">the energy that&#39;s holding up the weight</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.740" end="00:06:23.810" style="s2">as the weight hits one sand particle</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:25.220" style="s2">breaks beyond its capacity to hold its</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.810" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">friction is not as strong as the weight</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.220" end="00:06:29.330" style="s2">on it but as soon as it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:31.340" style="s2">holding weight that weight spreads to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.330" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">other sand particles they break and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.340" end="00:06:33.349" style="s2">get a whole cascade failure into an</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:36.169" style="s2">avalanche</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.349" end="00:06:37.699" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s a very good sort of simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.169" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">example of the notion of a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.699" end="00:06:42.650" style="s2">failure now if we return that back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:46.039" style="s2">what we&#39;re dealing with we have at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.650" end="00:06:49.849" style="s2">first level of analysis we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.039" end="00:06:51.470" style="s2">large number of subsystems meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.849" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">things that we could normally speak of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.470" end="00:06:55.130" style="s2">as just being their own thing that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:57.229" style="s2">very linked together in by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.130" end="00:06:59.810" style="s2">complex and highly unpredictable ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.229" end="00:07:01.819" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a simple you know linkage</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.810" end="00:07:03.320" style="s2">this way it&#39;s it&#39;s a rich mesh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.819" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">difficult to know exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.320" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">implications of I lived in the United</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.530" style="s2">States so I have a much cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:14.229" style="s2">experience of what&#39;s happening here but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.530" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">the implications of a of a mass</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.229" end="00:07:19.130" style="s2">quarantine okay well what implications</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:22.280" style="s2">does that have for our food supply</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.130" end="00:07:24.710" style="s2">chains very difficult to know then</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.280" end="00:07:29.419" style="s2">suddenly oh it turns out that dairy</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.710" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">farmers have to waste get rid of of milk</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.419" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">because x y and z reason wheat seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">unaffected in facts need to be getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">cheaper because oil prices are going</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:45.300" style="s2">down and slaughterhouses</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:46.729" style="s2">are shutting down completely this would</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.300" end="00:07:50.449" style="s2">have been very difficult to predict</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.729" end="00:07:53.969" style="s2">beforehand that&#39;s the complex linkages</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.449" end="00:07:56.969" style="s2">but then we can go up to a to one level</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.969" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">higher in abstraction and talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.969" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">bit about why so we can now begin to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">a bit a bit deeper into the inquiry the</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:43.500" style="s2">habits it has tendencies it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.420" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">has found situations that didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.250" end="00:17:06.920" style="s2">work well it&#39;s had to add epicycles and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:10.699" style="s2">it&#39;s become more and more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.920" end="00:17:13.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very heavy</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.699" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">thing that very few people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:16.740" style="s2">have any idea exactly how to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">with it and probably no one really knows</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.740" end="00:17:23.490" style="s2">how to make it work well because it&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:30.660" style="s2">into the meta-crisis in two very</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:34.020" style="s2">distinct ways and I think this this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.660" end="00:17:41.850" style="s2">why I had to tell that story on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.020" end="00:17:43.800" style="s2">first hand it&#39;s what holds the three</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.850" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">ways actually it&#39;s what holds the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.800" end="00:17:50.550" style="s2">subsystems that we have as they are so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.260" style="s2">the notion we think of say finance as</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.550" end="00:17:54.360" style="s2">being a certain kind of thing and has</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.260" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">banks for example finance has banks and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.360" end="00:17:59.820" style="s2">as money that works in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:01.080" style="s2">the education has schools that work in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.820" end="00:18:01.410" style="s2">certain way and look like a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.080" end="00:18:04.140" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.410" end="00:18:08.760" style="s2">well this paradigm this blue church</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.140" end="00:18:10.950" style="s2">paradigm is the meta system that makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.760" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">those subsystems look the way they look</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.950" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">and holds them constrains them if I were</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:19.800" style="s2">to say to you Thomas imagine a way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">doing finance that didn&#39;t have banks you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.800" end="00:18:22.620" style="s2">might be able to you&#39;re very creative</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:24.270" style="s2">individual you might be able to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.620" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">imagine it but imagine trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2">accomplish it you begin running into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.160" end="00:18:30.540" style="s2">fact that well in ordinary times you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:33.179" style="s2">have to convince the government to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.540" end="00:18:34.710" style="s2">that which means that you&#39;re now moving</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.179" end="00:18:36.270" style="s2">from the finance domain into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.710" end="00:18:38.130" style="s2">governance domain because the governance</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.270" end="00:18:39.660" style="s2">domain constrains what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.130" end="00:18:41.580" style="s2">possibilities there are in the finance</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.660" end="00:18:43.260" style="s2">and it holds it together in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.580" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">way it&#39;s like the scaffolding of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.260" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">this space can look like so it creates</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">the the meta structure that constrains</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:56.780" style="s2">the relationship in the nation ships</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:19:02.090" style="s2">sub-systems one two this characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.780" end="00:19:04.820" style="s2">of economic optimization as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.090" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">is one of the most powerful games that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.820" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">was available in the blue church in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:16.309" style="s2">paradigm that has become our dominant</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:18.049" style="s2">paradigm and what I mean by that is you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.309" end="00:19:21.010" style="s2">know like when you when you as a child</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.049" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">very very first played the game</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.010" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">tic-tac-toe</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">it was nearly infinite in potential the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">notion that you put X&#39;s and not smiley</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:34.910" style="s2">faces and O&#39;s and not squares and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:37.190" style="s2">you could only put them inside the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.910" end="00:19:38.410" style="s2">initially the nature of the game was</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.190" end="00:19:41.059" style="s2">quite mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.410" end="00:19:42.740" style="s2">but after little while became very clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.059" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2">what the nature the game was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.740" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">structure became evident and then after</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:49.130" style="s2">a little while became very clear what</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">the root what the valid moves were and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.130" end="00:19:54.410" style="s2">of course the game was done kids of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:58.610" style="s2">tic-tac-toe well what I would propose is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.410" end="00:20:00.020" style="s2">that in the 50s and the 60s the game of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.610" end="00:20:01.820" style="s2">the dumb and a paradigm that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.020" end="00:20:03.080" style="s2">now was relatively unknown it was open</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.820" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">many people were trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.080" end="00:20:09.010" style="s2">what it could and couldn&#39;t do the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:12.350" style="s2">you got to the 70s it had become no and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.010" end="00:20:16.780" style="s2">one of the moves one of the the most the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.350" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">winning moves was money on money return</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.780" end="00:20:24.230" style="s2">the move of economic optimization and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">and therefore that particular move has</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.230" end="00:20:27.710" style="s2">found itself cascading and circulating</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:29.570" style="s2">through all the subsystems that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.710" end="00:20:31.750" style="s2">constrained by the dominant paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.570" end="00:20:35.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s one of the moves that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.750" end="00:20:37.549" style="s2">central to the essential meta moves</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.540" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">inside the dominant paradigm alright</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.549" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">does that make sense what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.690" end="00:20:52.670" style="s2">and then we have the third I think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.940" end="00:20:56.990" style="s2">third is what is most relevant to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.670" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">particular forum because it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:01.370" style="s2">with consciousness and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:05.150" style="s2">psychology which is to my mind it is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.370" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">set a set of consciousness because in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.150" end="00:21:09.290" style="s2">the context of the dominant paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:13.309" style="s2">that were in in the context of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.290" end="00:21:15.920" style="s2">church as I mentioned there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.309" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">constraint or scaffold and that holds</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.920" end="00:21:22.490" style="s2">together what finance is and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:26.660" style="s2">education is and that constraint happens</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.490" end="00:21:28.790" style="s2">in in two very distinct ways it happens</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.660" end="00:21:33.260" style="s2">in the level of our of our design</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.790" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">imagination if we try to imagine a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.260" end="00:21:41.559" style="s2">of accomplishing an objective trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:44.900" style="s2">do something we will default our</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.559" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">unconscious response will be produced</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.900" end="00:21:50.780" style="s2">for us by the dominant paradigm because</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:53.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the easiest answer as adults as</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.780" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">children living in this world it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.540" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">been impressed upon us to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:22:02.990" style="s2">just becomes habit that if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.480" end="00:22:05.059" style="s2">get money and go to the ATM machine or</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.990" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">if you want to buy things you give them</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.059" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">your credit card I remember when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:10.610" style="s2">moved from cash to credit cards and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:12.890" style="s2">exactly how that shift occurred I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.610" end="00:22:14.120" style="s2">you all as well and maybe never did</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.890" end="00:22:16.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a small number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.120" end="00:22:16.809" style="s2">didn&#39;t make that change</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.220" end="00:22:21.640" style="s2">and of course that that does habits or</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:23.500" style="s2">even more meaningful when it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.640" end="00:22:24.790" style="s2">larger structures when we think about</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.680" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">for the new kind of questions we are we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:44.230" style="s2">are asking it didn&#39;t work anymore it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:48.340" style="s2">became very much dysfunctional yeah too</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.230" end="00:23:50.200" style="s2">much if I relate this example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.340" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">bringing because this seems to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.200" end="00:23:55.350" style="s2">of a percenter of the meta crisis it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:58.890" style="s2">it was the epicenter of the meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.350" end="00:24:01.960" style="s2">from the medieval time to modernity</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.890" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">where something broke down and something</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:05.950" style="s2">different opened up which had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">a completely different understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.950" end="00:24:10.780" style="s2">reality works what really is about what</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:15.670" style="s2">makes us think about for the reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.780" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">works so oh why a rightist image because</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.670" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s very obvious there&#39;s a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.520" end="00:24:23.560" style="s2">how this we got to look like in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:25.180" style="s2">medieval times and it&#39;s very obvious it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.560" end="00:24:29.650" style="s2">looked different starting the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.180" end="00:24:31.250" style="s2">cooperative&#39;s this mutant and decart and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.650" end="00:24:32.600" style="s2">all these people</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.250" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">to look different because they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.600" end="00:24:37.280" style="s2">different ideas about it and something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.760" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">changed dramatically and you let me</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.280" end="00:24:41.030" style="s2">bring this to what you&#39;re describing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:44.780" style="s2">the blue church in the economic system</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.030" end="00:24:46.610" style="s2">they establish itself 1944-45 and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.780" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">really where it is hide in the 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.610" end="00:24:52.340" style="s2">came well complex in the 70s had some</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.220" end="00:24:56.600" style="s2">particular change in the eighties until</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.340" end="00:24:59.470" style="s2">tips some really big wall at least 2008</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.600" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.470" end="00:25:06.679" style="s2">the question I would like to ask is you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:09.110" style="s2">see this how does the world look like</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.679" end="00:25:11.780" style="s2">from that perspective of the poor church</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.110" end="00:25:13.130" style="s2">how does the world look like even you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.780" end="00:25:17.299" style="s2">see through the eyes of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.130" end="00:25:20.210" style="s2">and why is this perspective come</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.299" end="00:25:24.650" style="s2">becoming dysfunctional right now hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.210" end="00:25:26.210" style="s2">well to the figure I feel I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.650" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">first is that what I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.210" end="00:25:31.220" style="s2">just try to venture an answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2">question but I&#39;m not proposing what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.220" end="00:25:35.419" style="s2">about to say is particularly insightful</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:36.860" style="s2">and what I&#39;d hope is that just by</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.419" end="00:25:39.049" style="s2">putting something out there it can begin</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.860" end="00:25:41.299" style="s2">the process of responding to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.049" end="00:25:43.460" style="s2">question more fully so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.299" end="00:25:45.409" style="s2">that comes to my mind is the world looks</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.460" end="00:25:48.260" style="s2">like something that needs to be managed</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.409" end="00:25:50.630" style="s2">hmm right when I say this is the very</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.260" end="00:25:56.679" style="s2">center of the blue church there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.630" end="00:25:56.679" style="s2">managerial consciousness mind that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:05.890" style="s2">builds the kind of mind that can create</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.770" end="00:26:07.990" style="s2">take us to the moon hmm the kind of mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.890" end="00:26:10.920" style="s2">that can take a problem and manage the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.990" end="00:26:12.970" style="s2">problem break it down into its pieces</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.920" end="00:26:16.180" style="s2">understand how each of the pieces can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.970" end="00:26:21.400" style="s2">optimized build it back up into a system</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.180" end="00:26:23.380" style="s2">that we can track and measure and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.400" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">gives us more at what it is whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.380" end="00:26:28.570" style="s2">was that we were optimizing for in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:33.910" style="s2">portion of the world this is called a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.570" end="00:26:37.690" style="s2">Six Sigma mind in if I recall correctly</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.910" end="00:26:42.600" style="s2">in the last half of theof the American</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.690" end="00:26:46.120" style="s2">side of World War two it was called</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.600" end="00:26:50.290" style="s2">operational management can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.120" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">this the story was that inside the War</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.290" end="00:26:54.280" style="s2">Department of the United States there</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">was a small number of people who were</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.280" end="00:27:00.580" style="s2">using statistics the study what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:03.390" style="s2">military strategies were the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.580" end="00:27:06.310" style="s2">efficient and noticed a number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.390" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">strategies that seemed like a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.310" end="00:27:13.660" style="s2">actually weren&#39;t by using statistics to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.390" end="00:27:17.070" style="s2">model it and you know after the war that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.660" end="00:27:20.020" style="s2">seemed that that insight percolated out</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.070" end="00:27:24.100" style="s2">building managerial how would you call</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.020" end="00:27:27.660" style="s2">it meritocratic bureaucracy how do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.100" end="00:27:31.690" style="s2">find the best people and then give them</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.660" end="00:27:37.170" style="s2">bureaucratic institutions to manage to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.690" end="00:27:39.560" style="s2">do the best mm-hmm yeah now think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.170" end="00:27:44.930" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.560" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">the confession of the blue church is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.930" end="00:27:51.650" style="s2">to manage the problem we want to create</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:54.830" style="s2">a vaccine we want to create tests you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.650" end="00:27:57.380" style="s2">want to trace we want to track who went</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.830" end="00:27:59.330" style="s2">to control we want to know what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.380" end="00:28:01.100" style="s2">happening we want to build that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.330" end="00:28:02.690" style="s2">knowledge into some system that we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.100" end="00:28:05.480" style="s2">understand we can control the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.690" end="00:28:07.250" style="s2">design this system and then we want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.480" end="00:28:10.340" style="s2">use that to achieve our desired results</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.250" end="00:28:13.480" style="s2">that&#39;s efficiently that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.340" end="00:28:15.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a decent swing at the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.480" end="00:28:17.750" style="s2">just wanted to say I mean particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.860" end="00:28:21.320" style="s2">when you bring it back now to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.750" end="00:28:24.680" style="s2">corona crisis this seems to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.320" end="00:28:27.410" style="s2">decent way to go about things to try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.680" end="00:28:29.810" style="s2">kind of these statistics with numbers</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.410" end="00:28:34.730" style="s2">with understanding understand basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.810" end="00:28:39.080" style="s2">what this pandemic is about and find how</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.730" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">this virus works and find a way how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:43.220" style="s2">can count the active areas with the vex</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:46.760" style="s2">ion and then somehow find a way how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.220" end="00:28:49.670" style="s2">produce it for a reasonable cost and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.760" end="00:28:53.540" style="s2">then basically hit it and defeat it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.670" end="00:28:56.390" style="s2">right I&#39;m complete that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.540" end="00:28:57.770" style="s2">decent thing to do if that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.390" end="00:28:59.300" style="s2">exactly the right thing to do it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.770" end="00:29:02.420" style="s2">like to not do that would be obviously</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.300" end="00:29:05.240" style="s2">you know so if this is the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.420" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">of the people Church this let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.240" end="00:29:10.400" style="s2">natural mineral consciousness kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.970" end="00:29:12.980" style="s2">like that and I think it makes the point</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.400" end="00:29:15.110" style="s2">and institutions and their left us is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.980" end="00:29:18.410" style="s2">called science and the particular ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.110" end="00:29:21.980" style="s2">of science statistical science and their</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.410" end="00:29:26.210" style="s2">institutions who hold that in economics</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.980" end="00:29:28.340" style="s2">in universities and in the media hold</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.210" end="00:29:31.580" style="s2">this as the perspective and it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.340" end="00:29:33.620" style="s2">manageable world that&#39;s helped by kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.580" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">of that&#39;s my basically I think the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.620" end="00:29:38.510" style="s2">of church is also good it&#39;s held like</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:41.030" style="s2">kind of a circle of light with people</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.510" end="00:29:43.640" style="s2">who need the wisdom of then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.030" end="00:29:46.820" style="s2">knowledge to do that and create the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.640" end="00:29:49.220" style="s2">trust of the of the trust institutions</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.820" end="00:29:51.620" style="s2">but the trust of table of the populace</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.220" end="00:29:52.909" style="s2">under they do the right thing and create</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.620" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">the conferences</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.909" end="00:29:58.519" style="s2">so the throughout things can be done</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:30:00.729" style="s2">organized and found that&#39;s technological</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.519" end="00:30:07.009" style="s2">solutions for the problems of the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.729" end="00:30:10.009" style="s2">s victory particularly if we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.009" end="00:30:12.769" style="s2">Corona crisis Lex I&#39;m a sounds it like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.009" end="00:30:15.729" style="s2">reasonable thing to do but I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.769" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">somehow that the perspective in itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.729" end="00:30:21.559" style="s2">has run out of this course why yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:23.509" style="s2">well but I want to highlight one thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.559" end="00:30:25.159" style="s2">that was in what you said but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.509" end="00:30:26.599" style="s2">make it more explicit because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.159" end="00:30:31.909" style="s2">a part of what&#39;s happening in a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.599" end="00:30:33.559" style="s2">important way so we said special people</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.909" end="00:30:37.399" style="s2">are enlightened people and what I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.559" end="00:30:40.220" style="s2">say is to something like there must be</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.399" end="00:30:42.739" style="s2">an official Authority in this in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.220" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">context of managerial consciousness we</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.739" end="00:30:50.059" style="s2">must have an official authority there</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:53.090" style="s2">must be some specific institution that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.059" end="00:30:55.999" style="s2">is responsible for making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.090" end="00:30:58.419" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and designing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.999" end="00:30:58.419" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:03.410" style="s2">ideally it&#39;s effective do it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.700" end="00:31:06.290" style="s2">competent official Authority but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.410" end="00:31:08.390" style="s2">crucial is that it&#39;s that it exists so</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.290" end="00:31:12.460" style="s2">for example I think yesterday or the day</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.390" end="00:31:16.040" style="s2">before Susan the CEO of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.460" end="00:31:18.280" style="s2">announced that YouTube will sense it</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:20.590" style="s2">will take down any videos that are</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.510" end="00:31:47.960" style="s2">of course that&#39;s crucial because well</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.660" end="00:31:54.170" style="s2">let me see if I can make this very</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.960" end="00:31:58.120" style="s2">smooth mmm how do I say this in a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.170" end="00:31:58.120" style="s2">that is simple</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:10.460" style="s2">ah okay one of the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.560" end="00:32:14.210" style="s2">the world in which we live is that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.460" end="00:32:19.220" style="s2">changes quickly and the relationships</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.220" end="00:32:25.540" style="s2">just not comparable to the 1950s in the</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.970" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">another characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.950" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">is it it&#39;s very complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.330" end="00:32:41.660" style="s2">the actual number of relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:46.310" style="s2">are is very large and therefore the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.660" end="00:32:49.820" style="s2">that cause and effect looks low is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.310" end="00:32:51.260" style="s2">large and again I don&#39;t mean to wave my</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.820" end="00:32:54.920" style="s2">hands that the word very needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.260" end="00:32:57.470" style="s2">some very nice large many scalable</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.920" end="00:32:59.480" style="s2">German word is probably right like super</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.480" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">large and this is important I think as</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.560" end="00:33:40.510" style="s2">the consequences of its own actions you</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.430" end="00:34:01.270" style="s2">right but the right choice was herd</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.780" end="00:34:06.040" style="s2">immunity and so they began to make that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.270" end="00:34:11.950" style="s2">choice then they began to discover that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.040" end="00:34:14.830" style="s2">the the exponential growth perhaps by</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.950" end="00:34:17.950" style="s2">the way perhaps and the the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.830" end="00:34:20.470" style="s2">have to say perhaps several times is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.950" end="00:34:24.220" style="s2">evidence of what I&#39;m saying the</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.130" end="00:34:36.030" style="s2">nonetheless we have a narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.170" end="00:34:37.650" style="s2">that their institutions of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.030" end="00:34:40.110" style="s2">came back with a different story</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.650" end="00:34:41.310" style="s2">not too long after a week two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.110" end="00:34:43.980" style="s2">later think how fast that is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.310" end="00:34:49.020" style="s2">bureaucratic time and the entire nation</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.980" end="00:34:50.340" style="s2">had to pivot 180 degrees no no shelter</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.340" end="00:34:56.760" style="s2">but you know all the way to the edge of</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.760" end="00:35:02.130" style="s2">that action includes among the long list</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.730" end="00:35:06.330" style="s2">of consequences that the economy</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.130" end="00:35:07.350" style="s2">suddenly just implodes which I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.330" end="00:35:13.120" style="s2">and here&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.350" end="00:35:15.070" style="s2">many many people predicted that but</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.120" end="00:35:15.940" style="s2">this managerial consciousness is looking</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.070" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">at the world through a very narrow</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:22.540" style="s2">who can be in charge at the official</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.650" end="00:35:25.870" style="s2">institution it&#39;s not collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.540" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">intelligence it&#39;s a hierarchy that takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.870" end="00:35:29.740" style="s2">certain kinds of intelligence from the</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.590" end="00:35:36.490" style="s2">top the top now is responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.540" end="00:35:38.860" style="s2">understanding all of this and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.490" end="00:35:40.120" style="s2">make choices and cascade out and as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.860" end="00:35:41.590" style="s2">choices cast get out the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.120" end="00:35:46.090" style="s2">those choices become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.590" end="00:35:49.840" style="s2">complex so the the architecture the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.090" end="00:35:53.070" style="s2">underlying fundamentals of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.840" end="00:35:55.660" style="s2">the design of managerial consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.360" end="00:36:13.450" style="s2">the consequences of its own actions okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.140" end="00:36:17.140" style="s2">let me come in here because the very</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.450" end="00:36:22.060" style="s2">near you and it&#39;s it&#39;s a complete</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.140" end="00:36:25.300" style="s2">oversimplification but anyway it seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.060" end="00:36:28.030" style="s2">that basically what is a crisis right</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.300" end="00:36:34.780" style="s2">now is a very simple thing the world is</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.030" end="00:36:37.300" style="s2">not manageable anymore period and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.780" end="00:36:41.470" style="s2">crisis as I understand you in the end is</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.300" end="00:36:44.140" style="s2">the crisis of sense making any choice</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.470" end="00:36:47.800" style="s2">the sense making in choice making in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.140" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2">which that the mental way of creating</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.800" end="00:36:53.710" style="s2">stains and choice which you call the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.900" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">butchart becomes dysfunctional and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.710" end="00:37:01.830" style="s2">hyper connected hyper complex and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:04.150" style="s2">and also high-speed reality that we AM</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.830" end="00:37:09.160" style="s2">needs a complete revolution of sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.150" end="00:37:11.730" style="s2">making choice making which is beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.160" end="00:37:14.890" style="s2">Silence of the blue church but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.730" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">self-organized causes of collective self</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.890" end="00:37:19.660" style="s2">set sense meeting that we are just in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:22.850" style="s2">the process of inventing what it is yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.660" end="00:37:24.500" style="s2">yes and that maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.850" end="00:37:26.570" style="s2">if it&#39;s not the crisis itself but this</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.500" end="00:37:28.760" style="s2">is a core part of the crisis but</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.570" end="00:37:31.550" style="s2">basically the way we make sense and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.760" end="00:37:33.230" style="s2">make choices have old habits that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.550" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">call the silo habits of tip of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.230" end="00:37:37.910" style="s2">church and then they&#39;re very functional</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:40.190" style="s2">in the 50s and the 60s and they became</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.910" end="00:37:42.590" style="s2">problematic formatting in the 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.190" end="00:37:44.330" style="s2">and oh you don&#39;t have to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.590" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">details but something does not work</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.930" end="00:37:49.340" style="s2">and one way to understand what is not</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.180" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">of sense making that allows a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.690" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">understanding of what reality is and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.950" style="s2">then basically pulls it out through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:11.390" style="s2">world and pulls it out to our society</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.950" end="00:38:14.330" style="s2">and what this is not working anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.390" end="00:38:15.890" style="s2">what maybe is on the verge of working is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.330" end="00:38:17.810" style="s2">something that cooks in a complete</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.890" end="00:38:21.290" style="s2">different way because there is no center</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.420" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">sense-making works in a completely</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.840" end="00:39:34.110" style="s2">40 and her youngest 20 should be already</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.050" end="00:39:36.030" style="s2">quite skillful at this this should have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.110" end="00:39:39.000" style="s2">been there the developmental environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.030" end="00:39:41.550" style="s2">should have been this new way mm-hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.000" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">we were held back we were helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.550" end="00:39:48.690" style="s2">parented by the by the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:51.810" style="s2">constrained into the old way and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.690" end="00:39:54.680" style="s2">instead of getting skillful when there</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.810" end="00:40:00.600" style="s2">was plenty of time to do it in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.680" end="00:40:02.610" style="s2">instead we built more epicycles so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.600" end="00:40:04.760" style="s2">are unfortunately rather behind the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.610" end="00:40:08.270" style="s2">curve we&#39;re behind the 8-ball we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.760" end="00:40:11.790" style="s2">mature rapidly in this new approach</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.270" end="00:40:17.070" style="s2">quite rapidly perhaps nearly</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.790" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2">instantaneously because the pace of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.070" end="00:40:22.290" style="s2">change continues to accelerate and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">complexity of our environment continues</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.290" end="00:40:33.080" style="s2">to grow and therefore the the bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:35.580" style="s2">combination between immaturity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.080" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">incapacity in the context of the blue</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:48.870" style="s2">through those channels we are not taking</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.730" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">us is increasingly delusional</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:02.760" style="s2">actually is mm-hmm so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:05.100" style="s2">last piece than what it is I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.760" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">say yeah and this last piece seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.100" end="00:41:09.870" style="s2">related to a different layer of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:11.480" style="s2">problem which is which is also a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.870" end="00:41:15.559" style="s2">generational problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.480" end="00:41:19.790" style="s2">at a problem of cultural habits the kind</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.460" end="00:41:30.200" style="s2">hyperlink to LD basically I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.079" end="00:41:32.030" style="s2">about the digital natives who are kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.200" end="00:41:35.630" style="s2">of socialized in a completely different</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.630" end="00:41:42.650" style="s2">like Twitter Facebook and and everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.569" end="00:41:46.040" style="s2">are part of my identity and my all</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.650" end="00:41:47.990" style="s2">understanding of learning doesn&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.040" end="00:41:49.970" style="s2">this part of reality anymore and we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.990" end="00:41:52.460" style="s2">to find new ways and there&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.970" end="00:41:55.700" style="s2">basically they say old habit that has to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.460" end="00:41:59.869" style="s2">break down that that comes from let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.700" end="00:42:02.329" style="s2">call it really digital reality yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.869" end="00:42:05.569" style="s2">well we go even further so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.329" end="00:42:07.450" style="s2">say is that again somewhere in the mid</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.569" end="00:42:11.540" style="s2">80s we should have begun the process of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.450" end="00:42:14.660" style="s2">breaking down analog habits and building</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.540" end="00:42:18.849" style="s2">digital habits and the reason one wanted</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.660" end="00:42:18.849" style="s2">to bring that up is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.570" end="00:42:25.350" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.230" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">you knew this the stories of Victorian</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.350" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">England the stories of urban squalor</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.870" end="00:42:35.980" style="s2">well one of the reasons why urban</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.030" end="00:42:38.410" style="s2">squalor was urban squalor was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.980" end="00:42:41.560" style="s2">cities grew before we had built a</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.560" end="00:42:45.580" style="s2">cities and whole problems emerged while</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.170" end="00:42:47.980" style="s2">we were still operating in it than a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.580" end="00:42:49.540" style="s2">mindset that was not appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.980" end="00:42:50.250" style="s2">cities and just didn&#39;t understand in the</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.250" end="00:42:55.290" style="s2">well a mature digital consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:43:00.910" style="s2">would not have allowed Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.290" end="00:43:03.790" style="s2">Twitter to happen to us the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.910" end="00:43:06.100" style="s2">toxicity of those environments would</p>

<p begin="00:43:18.820" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">said are you kidding that&#39;s absurd</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.410" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">that&#39;s like having children smoke</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.859" end="00:47:13.099" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.519" end="00:47:15.759" style="s2">so we get a the toxic digital</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.099" end="00:47:15.759" style="s2">environment is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.840" end="00:47:21.810" style="s2">surely simulacrum ah Baudrillard we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.290" end="00:47:23.850" style="s2">baudrillard yes the toxic digital</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.810" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">environment is a deep dive into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.850" end="00:47:30.030" style="s2">simulacrum across all people</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:32.030" style="s2">particularly young so the young have</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:35.360" style="s2">lost of capacity and by the young I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.030" end="00:47:38.220" style="s2">17 18 19 all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.360" end="00:47:40.650" style="s2">live in an environment where stimulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.220" end="00:47:43.800" style="s2">is much more real than reality could</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.650" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">hope to be and the simulation is in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.800" end="00:47:47.970" style="s2">simulation around and just think about</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:53.430" style="s2">how many hours people watch the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.970" end="00:47:55.500" style="s2">tick-tock to be is to produce those</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.430" end="00:47:59.190" style="s2">things that are copied to be is to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.500" end="00:48:04.620" style="s2">been copied to be real is to have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.190" end="00:48:06.330" style="s2">copied for example I mean it&#39;s a message</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.620" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">big question for the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.330" end="00:48:09.750" style="s2">conversation or getting to the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:12.920" style="s2">conversation but there has to be asked</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.750" end="00:48:18.050" style="s2">anyway so what&#39;s their response to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.920" end="00:48:20.970" style="s2">mm-hmm yes I think we have four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.050" end="00:48:23.640" style="s2">it can take a little kind of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.970" end="00:48:26.370" style="s2">more but ah the response is courage</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.640" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the first response why what</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.370" end="00:48:30.870" style="s2">lights for what yeah so the the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:31.110" style="s2">the visual image that popped into my</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.870" end="00:48:33.750" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.110" end="00:48:39.540" style="s2">and this is a story that my friend Jimmy</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.750" end="00:48:44.990" style="s2">wheel was telling me says scientists</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.540" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">were doing a study of mice or rats and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.990" end="00:48:52.490" style="s2">what they noticed was that the xiphoid</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:57.900" style="s2">nucleus in the brain that the fear and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.490" end="00:48:59.340" style="s2">freeze response is fundamental because</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.900" end="00:49:03.110" style="s2">that&#39;s where the nucleus is even more</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.340" end="00:49:07.560" style="s2">fundamental which is the turn in fight</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.110" end="00:49:09.450" style="s2">the the willingness to face that which</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.560" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">is challenging that what just makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.450" end="00:49:14.100" style="s2">drives fear it&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:16.410" style="s2">fundamental which is to say that courage</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.100" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">is a more fundamental emotion than fear</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.410" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">and anger</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.160" end="00:49:26.769" style="s2">you can&#39;t think clearly in fear you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.130" end="00:49:31.089" style="s2">can&#39;t act clearly in anger but with</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.769" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">courage you can begin the process of not</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.089" end="00:49:38.019" style="s2">being reactive to your environment and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:40.119" style="s2">not lashing out at your environment my</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.019" end="00:49:43.329" style="s2">which is another form the fear versions</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.119" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">to be thrown about tossed about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.329" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">anger version is to lash out wait if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">have courage as a root emotion you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:53.259" style="s2">stare the crisis directly in the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.259" end="00:49:59.759" style="s2">listen to the story of the medic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:50:02.200" style="s2">and not look away not going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.759" end="00:50:05.650" style="s2">unconscious reactivity or to delusion</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.200" end="00:50:08.950" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s one other piece I just want</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.650" end="00:50:10.779" style="s2">to bring into conversation see how you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.950" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">respond to that because there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.779" end="00:50:16.900" style="s2">something about this interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">in the Facebook reality that is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.900" end="00:50:21.099" style="s2">much related to the manageable</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:22.750" style="s2">consciousness that it created yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.099" end="00:50:24.190" style="s2">and you could call them measureable</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.750" end="00:50:28.029" style="s2">interconnectivity because it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.190" end="00:50:31.269" style="s2">basically yeah as a mention of systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.029" end="00:50:33.390" style="s2">of logarithms yeah yeah I won&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.269" end="00:50:38.460" style="s2">count the posters with a liveable</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.390" end="00:50:41.410" style="s2">interconnectivity where the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.460" end="00:50:42.779" style="s2">aliveness in the inhuman living</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.410" end="00:50:44.740" style="s2">interconnectedness is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.779" end="00:50:48.519" style="s2">multidimensionality comes into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.740" end="00:50:51.779" style="s2">picture it changes what</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.519" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">interconnectivity is about dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.779" end="00:51:00.839" style="s2">that allows collective sense meeting to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:04.619" style="s2">basically leap beyond this manage</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.839" end="00:51:07.390" style="s2">connectivity of I stay with Facebook so</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.619" end="00:51:12.369" style="s2">something that&#39;s emerging between us as</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.390" end="00:51:13.960" style="s2">we connect as human beings in networks</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.369" end="00:51:16.660" style="s2">of relationships but living</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.960" end="00:51:18.339" style="s2">relationships yes the thing that I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.660" end="00:51:19.660" style="s2">seen that seems most close to this and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.339" end="00:51:22.569" style="s2">feel very good about it feels very</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.660" end="00:51:26.650" style="s2">powerful are being called digital</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.569" end="00:51:29.410" style="s2">campfires my friend Brett Weinstein told</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.650" end="00:51:31.420" style="s2">the story of of consciousness in fact is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.410" end="00:51:33.640" style="s2">not held in an individual we don&#39;t we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.420" end="00:51:35.859" style="s2">not conscious as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.640" end="00:51:37.299" style="s2">and we&#39;re conscious in groups and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.859" end="00:51:39.039" style="s2">most conscious in groups sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.299" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">the campfire that&#39;s the place where</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.039" end="00:51:43.390" style="s2">consciousness really landed in humans</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:44.920" style="s2">and this new creation is ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.390" end="00:51:48.819" style="s2">digital campfires groups with people</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.920" end="00:51:51.700" style="s2">coming into groups of five three thirty</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.819" end="00:51:53.349" style="s2">in a space that has the feeling of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.700" end="00:51:54.819" style="s2">campfire and then getting up and moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.349" end="00:51:57.369" style="s2">to the next campfire and creating this</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.819" end="00:51:59.710" style="s2">mesh of campfire it&#39;s beginning to flow</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.369" end="00:52:02.069" style="s2">and evolve is creating a space for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.710" end="00:52:06.099" style="s2">much for a truly larger consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.069" end="00:52:07.720" style="s2">vastly larger shouldn&#39;t it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.099" end="00:52:11.549" style="s2">just the beginning of a conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.720" end="00:52:14.589" style="s2">they also are at the end of our time I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.549" end="00:52:17.140" style="s2">would like to also make it the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.589" end="00:52:19.960" style="s2">of a conversation I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.140" end="00:52:21.519" style="s2">continue at some point this but I really</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.960" end="00:52:23.710" style="s2">like that you landed in the in the very</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.519" end="00:52:25.059" style="s2">end because we were talking about corner</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.710" end="00:52:26.859" style="s2">wires we&#39;re talking about medical eyes</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.059" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.859" end="00:52:30.940" style="s2">mental consciousness and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.490" style="s2">about interconnectedness but the digital</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.940" end="00:52:35.319" style="s2">campfire that you are bringing in right</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.490" end="00:52:37.180" style="s2">now and you just touched on it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.319" end="00:52:41.319" style="s2">there&#39;s basically it&#39;s just a starting</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.180" end="00:52:43.240" style="s2">point of something what is this but my</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.319" end="00:52:46.059" style="s2">interest response is to taste a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.240" end="00:52:47.799" style="s2">an answer to this that an answer that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.059" end="00:52:52.599" style="s2">have to engage in collectively to find</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.799" end="00:52:53.609" style="s2">if malleable it is in that sense thank</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.599" end="00:52:55.630" style="s2">you so much for this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.609" end="00:52:59.309" style="s2">perhaps we&#39;ll see each other the next</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.630" end="00:52:59.309" style="s2">campfire see you there</p>
