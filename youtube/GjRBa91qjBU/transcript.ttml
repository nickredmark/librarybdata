<p begin="00:00:00.990" end="00:00:07.270" style="s2">so as I&#39;ve been contemplating these</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.690" end="00:00:11.710" style="s2">videos and I&#39;ve been thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.270" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">the right bite size I&#39;ve noticed that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.710" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">order to convey the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:22.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of smaller bites so</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:26.710" style="s2">at this point I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.720" end="00:00:30.189" style="s2">proceed by grabbing the largest bites</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.710" end="00:00:33.670" style="s2">that I think I can convey in say seven</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.189" end="00:00:36.159" style="s2">minutes and then trying to put them in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.670" end="00:00:38.499" style="s2">an order where bigger pieces can</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.159" end="00:00:41.170" style="s2">actually start to come together so what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.499" end="00:00:42.639" style="s2">I&#39;d actually request is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.170" end="00:00:46.179" style="s2">process if you happen to be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.639" end="00:00:48.760" style="s2">these at all of looking at them that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.179" end="00:00:51.549" style="s2">contemplate each piece as being</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.760" end="00:00:53.729" style="s2">endeavoring to stand alone but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.549" end="00:00:56.649" style="s2">definitely doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.729" end="00:00:58.479" style="s2">fully outside of a much broader context</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.649" end="00:01:02.379" style="s2">and there is in fact a much better</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.479" end="00:01:05.740" style="s2">context so today I want to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.379" end="00:01:07.649" style="s2">model that I call the the arc Heidi</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.740" end="00:01:10.659" style="s2">Smith model in I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.649" end="00:01:13.450" style="s2">well known it&#39;s not as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.659" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">published in any fashion and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.450" end="00:01:19.210" style="s2">of a heuristic but it&#39;s useful and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:23.170" style="s2">alright so here we go the premise is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.210" end="00:01:27.250" style="s2">that we can identify three consistent</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.170" end="00:01:33.149" style="s2">phases in how human beings as</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.250" end="00:01:35.320" style="s2">individuals and groups operate together</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.149" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">strategically I suppose that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.320" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">really the best term but you&#39;ll get it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:45.310" style="s2">almost it&#39;s almost like a typology so</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:49.299" style="s2">the first type is what I&#39;m gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.310" end="00:01:51.340" style="s2">the wild type and importantly the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.299" end="00:01:53.829" style="s2">key context of the wild type is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.340" end="00:01:57.429" style="s2">wild type is optimized for adapted for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.829" end="00:02:00.039" style="s2">the niche of just nature so human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.429" end="00:02:03.310" style="s2">where the primary problems are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.039" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">associated with survival in nature are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.310" end="00:02:10.090" style="s2">the wild type senses are received</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:11.620" style="s2">evolved toolkit and is what we became</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.090" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">over two and a half million years and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.620" end="00:02:14.470" style="s2">what we very much were four to 250</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:16.660" style="s2">thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.470" end="00:02:18.310" style="s2">and we got good enough at it that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.660" end="00:02:22.210" style="s2">developed a toolkit that I will call</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:25.240" style="s2">consciousness that enabled us to move</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.210" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">into any new niche we could be in in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.240" end="00:02:29.410" style="s2">African savanna it could be the Arctic</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:32.650" style="s2">it could be Polynesians out in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.410" end="00:02:35.320" style="s2">and in a timeframe that is much much</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.650" end="00:02:37.720" style="s2">faster than biological evolution could</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.320" end="00:02:39.820" style="s2">develop an adaptive capacity that not</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.720" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">only made us able to survive in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.820" end="00:02:43.570" style="s2">niche but very quickly actually made us</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.530" end="00:02:46.420" style="s2">the peak predator in that niche and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.570" end="00:02:49.900" style="s2">the wild type human has this capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.420" end="00:02:54.580" style="s2">use a way of working together as a group</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.900" end="00:02:58.420" style="s2">to achieve a capability of very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.580" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">rapidly building a toolkit that enables</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">them to enter into and become the peak</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:08.500" style="s2">predator in any natural nation and when</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:11.080" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about consciousness I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.500" end="00:03:13.570" style="s2">to be a little careful because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.080" end="00:03:14.620" style="s2">really wide-ranging word that means a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.570" end="00:03:16.330" style="s2">lot of things to a lot of people so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.620" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">actually been something specific and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.330" end="00:03:21.310" style="s2">kind of simpler maybe a little bit not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">intuitive and that is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.310" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">happens when different people come</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">together and are capable of engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">a good-faith conversation the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:31.810" style="s2">the synergistic value of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:34.330" style="s2">different human perspectives working</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.810" end="00:03:35.890" style="s2">together that generates something which</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.330" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">is much much larger than the sum of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.890" end="00:03:39.430" style="s2">parts and so that&#39;s actually what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:42.250" style="s2">by consciousness and maybe I should use</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.430" end="00:03:44.230" style="s2">a different term for it but it is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.250" end="00:03:45.670" style="s2">fact the content of most of our minds</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.230" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">right most of what we have in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.670" end="00:03:51.010" style="s2">is the consequence of interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:52.510" style="s2">other people that upgrade our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.010" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the world how the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.510" end="00:03:56.380" style="s2">world works and how we should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:04:00.100" style="s2">responsive to it so culture for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.380" end="00:04:02.350" style="s2">is produced by consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.100" end="00:04:06.040" style="s2">consciousness is generated in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.350" end="00:04:12.940" style="s2">context of culture and so this complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">of a wild type human in a arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.940" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">large number of possible niches using</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:21.669" style="s2">consciousness in the context of culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">to produce a culture that is adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.669" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">a niche is the first big piece so then</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.440" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">interesting happens when the nish shifts</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:39.330" style="s2">from being nature to being consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:42.390" style="s2">and culture itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.330" end="00:04:46.020" style="s2">this happens when wild type groups enter</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.390" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">into conflict where they can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.020" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">migrate further to resolve a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:53.610" style="s2">and so my wild-type tribe and your</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">wild-type tribe have filled their local</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.610" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">niche and they&#39;re beginning to bump up</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">against each other as population</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:04.440" style="s2">increases or as we maybe hunt native</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:06.690" style="s2">animals to extinction and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.440" end="00:05:07.650" style="s2">other place for us to go that if I move</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.690" end="00:05:08.850" style="s2">this way there&#39;s somebody else there</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.650" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">this way there&#39;s somebody else there</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.850" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">that humans have expanded to fill all</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">available space and have begun to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">actually fill the carrying capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:21.020" style="s2">that space and now we&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">conflict with ourselves as our primary</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.020" end="00:05:29.370" style="s2">selection requirement so stage 2 now it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">emerges in stage 2</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.370" end="00:05:34.220" style="s2">and I think this transition is probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">the most important part of this model</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.220" end="00:05:42.630" style="s2">I&#39;m going to call the domesticated type</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">domesticated type has the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.630" end="00:05:48.570" style="s2">coordinate much much larger groups of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">people than are available in the wild</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">type and it does this by taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:59.480" style="s2">consciousness and culture and making a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">move that simplifies both of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.480" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">enormous lis while maintaining a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:10.340" style="s2">substantial portion of their capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">generate synergistic capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.340" end="00:06:16.860" style="s2">also enabling them to scale so on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">one hand we move from consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.860" end="00:06:21.540" style="s2">narrative and on the other hand we move</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">from culture to society and in both</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.540" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">cases this basic way of feeling is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:31.320" style="s2">is it the something that is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:33.780" style="s2">informal in a very co-produced so</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.320" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">consciousness really has no content</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.780" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">other than the contributions of all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">people who are part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.330" end="00:06:41.179" style="s2">and nobody has any particular priority</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.839" style="s2">in the cover</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.179" end="00:06:44.279" style="s2">narratives doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.839" end="00:06:46.589" style="s2">narrative actually in some sense lives</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.279" end="00:06:49.080" style="s2">out there it&#39;s a formal narrative it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.589" end="00:06:52.259" style="s2">form of Mythology it&#39;s a dogma it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.080" end="00:06:53.999" style="s2">orthodoxy that you relate to as</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.259" end="00:06:56.369" style="s2">something that is in some sense older</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.999" end="00:06:58.469" style="s2">more foundational more real than you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.369" end="00:07:00.809" style="s2">you have to alert it and understand how</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.469" end="00:07:03.689" style="s2">to operate within it you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.809" end="00:07:05.580" style="s2">have any authority over it and to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.689" end="00:07:06.809" style="s2">extent there is any authority this</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.580" end="00:07:11.249" style="s2">actually exists embedded in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.809" end="00:07:13.229" style="s2">framework of society which is a more or</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.249" end="00:07:15.300" style="s2">less formal it is certainly real it may</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.229" end="00:07:18.239" style="s2">in fact be articulated it may not group</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:46.050" style="s2">domesticated outcompetes wild most of</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.209" end="00:09:41.809" style="s2">as the kingdom clears out the wild type</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.339" end="00:09:43.790" style="s2">in a sort of overloading and controlling</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.879" end="00:09:53.329" style="s2">framework you then begin to see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.249" end="00:09:56.329" style="s2">emergence of a niche for defection a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.329" end="00:09:59.029" style="s2">niche that begins to lose connection</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.329" end="00:10:00.889" style="s2">with nature because it&#39;s now fully</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.360" end="00:10:12.019" style="s2">this gives rise to effectively two major</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.779" style="s2">delusion which is a an identification</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.829" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">the other is defection which is the</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:18.300" style="s2">actually see it as the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">hierarchy with a sense of people who are</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna use a kind of poetic</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">language where justice is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.730" style="s2">happening and I think justice can really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:12:00.990" style="s2">be neatly described here when when good</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.730" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">acts are not rewarded and bad acts are</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.990" end="00:12:05.280" style="s2">not punished justice is absent so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:08.220" style="s2">can figure this is almost like a loop</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.890" end="00:12:27.480" style="s2">it&#39;s either I&#39;m acting in a way that is</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.620" end="00:12:48.690" style="s2">absence of justice and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.530" style="s2">the case that so far for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.690" end="00:12:52.080" style="s2">reasons that I&#39;ll have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.530" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">other videos any domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.080" end="00:12:56.940" style="s2">environment always ends up with gaps in</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.070" style="s2">justice and when you have a gap in</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.940" end="00:13:01.770" style="s2">justice what happens is you developing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.070" end="00:13:06.450" style="s2">niche or some smaller group let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.770" end="00:13:10.920" style="s2">cluster of gangsters a game which might</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.450" end="00:13:13.770" style="s2">be a cabal or it might be a group of</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.069" end="00:13:25.329" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t actually show up as any</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.049" end="00:15:19.149" style="s2">just in the narrative of the fall of</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.550" end="00:15:58.420" style="s2">have a nice bit of poetic story did it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.949" end="00:16:04.029" style="s2">that isn&#39;t thick I think telling the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.420" end="00:16:07.290" style="s2">story so before the show begins we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.029" end="00:16:09.670" style="s2">had a horrible collapse winter came</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.290" end="00:16:11.949" style="s2">creatures from the north came down they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.670" end="00:16:14.260" style="s2">wreaked havoc we&#39;re in a wild chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.949" end="00:16:17.010" style="s2">state something came together that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.260" end="00:16:19.449" style="s2">brought the people back into a space of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.010" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">able to operate they form separate</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.449" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">kingdoms largely familial they</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:29.170" style="s2">coordinated winter receded they built a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:30.790" style="s2">giant wall and then domestication said</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.170" end="00:16:35.160" style="s2">it and you had this interesting gradient</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.790" end="00:16:38.980" style="s2">where the north on the border with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.160" end="00:16:40.839" style="s2">undomesticated wild is what historically</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.980" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">is called the March like what a marquee</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.839" end="00:16:44.740" style="s2">is in charge of this is the border</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:46.300" style="s2">between the domesticated and the wild</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.740" end="00:16:48.730" style="s2">and them because the borders always</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.300" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">pushed on by nature they can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.730" end="00:16:54.279" style="s2">quite become slowly domesticated and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2">tends to be the most resilient to feral</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.279" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">T so it sort of holds the border you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:00.910" style="s2">all the way away from the border you end</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:03.250" style="s2">up in King&#39;s Landing as far away from</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.910" end="00:17:04.660" style="s2">the walls as you can get and in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:07.329" style="s2">center of empire in the center of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.660" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">domestication and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.329" end="00:17:11.020" style="s2">precisely because it doesn&#39;t receive any</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.949" end="00:17:13.780" style="s2">pushback from nature it is now the pure</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.020" end="00:17:15.490" style="s2">place where the niche is in fact society</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.780" end="00:17:17.620" style="s2">the niche is how to take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.490" end="00:17:20.049" style="s2">narrative and is the place where feral</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.620" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">tea emerges and where fir ality becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.049" end="00:17:26.020" style="s2">the dominant strategy so you see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.030" end="00:17:27.669" style="s2">tension between the Starks who are still</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.020" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">maintaining the integrity of high</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:37.630" style="s2">threats of beyond the pale and you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.230" end="00:17:40.450" style="s2">the Lannisters who are optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.630" end="00:17:42.280" style="s2">pure morality and have mastered the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.450" end="00:17:45.400" style="s2">subtle art of understanding how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.280" end="00:17:47.770" style="s2">destabilize the domesticated using the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.400" end="00:17:49.690" style="s2">tools of defection and by the way even</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.690" end="00:17:55.450" style="s2">and as we see looking of Thrones the</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.450" end="00:18:01.090" style="s2">domestic and eventually become overcome</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.400" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">rapidly has to redevelop a concentrated</p>
