<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">packaging and materials we do a solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">raising live every Wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">today&#39;s on packaging materials next</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">week&#39;s the meadow one we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">about how everything is interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">and if you fix one thing other things</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">break and so we&#39;re gonna see how that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">works and then the week after we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">going to talk about energy so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">power our lives currently and in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">future so getting started with the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">segment we&#39;re talking for roughly 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">minutes on what packaging and materials</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">currently look like in our lives and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">our economies and we can kind of do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">like an idea cafe or we each take a turn</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">it seems to work</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">would anyone like to start I can start</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">on this one again all right I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">gonna get you guys that you guys can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">done we got there happen Erica I need it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">and unmuted so materials and packaging</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">in our current economy today is garbage</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">slash compost slash recycling day and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">every day every week I have to take my</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">bin and pour it into a neighbor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">because I have way too much recycling</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">I&#39;m using way too much material or</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">they&#39;re not recycling right like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">amount of berries and grapes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:26.220" style="s2">everything that comes in in that like</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">soft plastic e material that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">recyclable but I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">like a little like they&#39;ve changed the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">regulations in their covet 19 of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">recyclable and what&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of owning that recycling is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">a bit of a farce and it&#39;s like well we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">can&#39;t ship this stuff to China we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">um do what we&#39;re normally doing with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">and there has to be another solution</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of things like we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:52.380" style="s2">we can grow we can make plastic-like</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">material out of kelp out of hemp out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.380" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">all the stuff but I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">knowledge on whether that&#39;s better or</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">not how much energy goes into it how</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">much water goes into it can we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:08.039" style="s2">and develop a material that is the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:10.020" style="s2">of all worlds it&#39;s durable but can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.039" end="00:02:11.849" style="s2">broken down and you know gets our</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">berries to market or do we need that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.849" end="00:02:14.380" style="s2">have it rip</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:17.860" style="s2">often paper right do we need things more</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.380" end="00:02:19.390" style="s2">local and when there&#39;s people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.860" end="00:02:21.459" style="s2">able to truly come up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.390" end="00:02:23.020" style="s2">material how do we trust it and how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.459" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">we get it to the people that that solves</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.020" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">a problem for these are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:28.240" style="s2">things that I would like us to do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.910" style="s2">wanna grab our know and I&#39;m getting on</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.240" end="00:02:34.270" style="s2">to the other other topics the future the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.910" end="00:02:37.780" style="s2">other two but currently our materials</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.270" end="00:02:39.310" style="s2">looks very wasteful and our solution to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.780" end="00:02:40.390" style="s2">that seems to be to recycle you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.310" end="00:02:42.790" style="s2">have to feel bad because it can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.390" end="00:02:47.100" style="s2">turned into something new but with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.790" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">exception of glass very little is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2">actually can be recovered again and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:54.010" style="s2">again plastic is downgraded every time</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:56.110" style="s2">and so yes we can recycle it and become</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.010" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">fluorine but what does that eat in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.110" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">how in our body and it&#39;s in our oceans</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:02.709" style="s2">and it&#39;s we have so much waste and yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">we&#39;re part of this ecosystem they</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.709" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">clearly works in a cycle everything is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">an input everything is an output and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:11.290" style="s2">when we figure that piece out then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.970" style="s2">can have all the packaging and all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.290" end="00:03:15.459" style="s2">materials if we can figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.970" end="00:03:17.560" style="s2">energy water and breaking down piece of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.459" end="00:03:19.209" style="s2">any of it then we can we can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.560" end="00:03:20.920" style="s2">packaging and have the best of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.209" end="00:03:25.110" style="s2">worlds but right now it looks very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.920" end="00:03:25.110" style="s2">wasteful and that&#39;s I won&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.450" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">who would like to go next can unmute</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">themselves no well what we do now is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">just downright irresponsible isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">you going buy a packet of biscuits and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:43.409" style="s2">each four biscuits is individually</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">wrapped in a little thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.409" end="00:03:46.379" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a stack of six of those in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:48.079" style="s2">box and then the box is wrapped in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.379" end="00:03:51.269" style="s2">plastic you know I mean it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.079" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">absurd what we do with packaging is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.269" end="00:03:55.409" style="s2">entirely I mean you could overnight Harv</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">I reckon the amount of packaging just</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.409" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">with a little bit of sensible we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">with a little bit of sensible management</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:02.549" style="s2">and planning you know so yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">downright I mean I&#39;ve got a personal bug</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.549" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">race it&#39;s not exactly patching but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">the same notion I&#39;ve got a personal bug</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">bear about straws of 500 million straws</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:15.629" style="s2">used and produced in the US alone every</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.120" end="00:04:17.639" style="s2">single week 500 million little bits of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.629" end="00:04:19.079" style="s2">plastic every single week it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.639" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">ridiculous you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.079" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">and so yeah I mean I&#39;m jumping ahead a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">little bit as well but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">that a lot of this straws is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:28.559" style="s2">excellent example right instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:31.649" style="s2">producing 500 million straws a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.559" end="00:04:33.599" style="s2">who wants straws by a permanent straw</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.649" end="00:04:35.819" style="s2">right a hard straw carry it around with</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.599" end="00:04:38.009" style="s2">you if you want or need a straw you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.819" end="00:04:39.959" style="s2">this and this kind of thing to be rolled</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.009" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">out in all kinds of packaging you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.959" end="00:04:43.379" style="s2">why every time you bet people buy milk</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:45.239" style="s2">every day or three or four times a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.379" end="00:04:47.219" style="s2">or whatever it is right why do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.239" end="00:04:49.019" style="s2">separate plastic bottle every time we</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.219" end="00:04:51.269" style="s2">buy milk we can&#39;t use the same bottle</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.019" end="00:04:53.009" style="s2">over and over and refill the milk from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.269" end="00:04:55.289" style="s2">big fat kind of thing and pay do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.009" end="00:04:58.199" style="s2">know things like this are really really</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.289" end="00:04:59.489" style="s2">really easy to do they just require a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.199" end="00:05:02.369" style="s2">little bit of thought a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.489" end="00:05:04.559" style="s2">planning but yeah the the the will to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.369" end="00:05:06.419" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t seem to be there despite</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.559" end="00:05:08.279" style="s2">what you believe said about this open</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.419" end="00:05:10.499" style="s2">loops thing right there ecosystems close</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.279" end="00:05:12.809" style="s2">all their loot and we&#39;ve got giant open</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.499" end="00:05:13.799" style="s2">loops we extract at one end and out</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.809" end="00:05:16.979" style="s2">at the other end you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.799" end="00:05:19.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s just the yeah that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.979" end="00:05:22.709" style="s2">all I have to say I&#39;m pretty outraged by</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.079" end="00:05:27.799" style="s2">the whole thing thanks Eric Shila do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.709" end="00:05:30.179" style="s2">want to take a turn to share for meanie</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.799" end="00:05:33.389" style="s2">week after we moved out here to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.179" end="00:05:35.939" style="s2">country we decided not to do the garbage</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.389" end="00:05:37.439" style="s2">service because we&#39;d have to take kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.939" end="00:05:39.149" style="s2">of a ways away we&#39;d have to drag our</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.439" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">garbage can and we decided we just go</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.149" end="00:05:43.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a transfer station probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.699" style="s2">seven miles away from here eight miles</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.709" end="00:05:50.999" style="s2">so not too far but because of that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.699" end="00:05:53.869" style="s2">become very aware of our waste so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.999" end="00:05:57.329" style="s2">kind of like really a stickler about</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.869" end="00:06:01.469" style="s2">using everything and as an artist I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.329" end="00:06:03.299" style="s2">collect a lot of containers all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.469" end="00:06:05.849" style="s2">stuff and try to reuse them or put them</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.299" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">into an art project so I&#39;m probably one</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.849" end="00:06:10.679" style="s2">of the best recyclers that I know not</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.149" style="s2">only do I recycle everything and take it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.679" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">personally to the dump and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.149" end="00:06:16.199" style="s2">it&#39;s all clean all these signs of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">dump are at the transfer station are</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.199" end="00:06:20.519" style="s2">saying that they might have to just stop</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:23.549" style="s2">having transportation there because</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.519" end="00:06:24.809" style="s2">people won&#39;t clean up they&#39;re recycling</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.549" end="00:06:26.879" style="s2">people won&#39;t put it in the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.809" end="00:06:29.009" style="s2">container I mean it&#39;s there for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.879" end="00:06:33.029" style="s2">free we can just go there and take it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.009" end="00:06:34.799" style="s2">for free and people will not abide by</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.029" end="00:06:37.649" style="s2">the rules I guess I guess I&#39;m a rural</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.799" end="00:06:41.399" style="s2">person but um I do I have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.649" end="00:06:41.880" style="s2">because I also recycle so I I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.399" end="00:06:44.580" style="s2">that if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.880" end="00:06:46.170" style="s2">do get the same of the same products</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">over and over and over you have the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.170" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">containers over and over so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">you can kind of find ways to reuse them</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:56.310" style="s2">yourself but I would you know my bigger</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:06:58.350" style="s2">picture my meta project is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.310" end="00:07:01.800" style="s2">value system that actually values people</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.350" end="00:07:03.960" style="s2">doing doing the recycling doing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.800" end="00:07:07.500" style="s2">correctly so there&#39;s more incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.960" end="00:07:09.600" style="s2">than just like oh now there&#39;s recycle</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.500" end="00:07:10.950" style="s2">bins out there anyway I do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.600" end="00:07:13.920" style="s2">recycling I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.950" end="00:07:18.450" style="s2">and even in the summer I go to forms</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.920" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">house and it was a big graduation party</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.450" end="00:07:21.630" style="s2">or something I&#39;m like we&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:23.190" style="s2">around beer cans I&#39;m like where it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.630" end="00:07:25.110" style="s2">where&#39;s the recycling they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.190" end="00:07:25.740" style="s2">recycling in there just like 40 miles</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.110" end="00:07:27.450" style="s2">from here</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.740" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">we&#39;re in Washington State with tons of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.450" end="00:07:31.980" style="s2">recycling and I was it&#39;s weird that even</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">more rural places don&#39;t even have it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.980" end="00:07:37.260" style="s2">available like I guess they could well</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.430" end="00:07:38.430" style="s2">they&#39;re not so into City they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.260" end="00:07:40.740" style="s2">they look at me go what do you think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.430" end="00:07:43.710" style="s2">gonna save the world I&#39;m like yes you</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.740" end="00:07:45.720" style="s2">can stop just throwing your recycling in</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.710" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">the trash but it&#39;s not very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.720" end="00:07:50.040" style="s2">anyway a little rant I have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.250" style="s2">ideas of what people can do with their</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.040" end="00:07:55.170" style="s2">garbage but talk about it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.250" end="00:07:57.960" style="s2">more for an open discussion on what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.170" end="00:08:00.150" style="s2">what is currently happening I know what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.960" end="00:08:02.910" style="s2">the like I grew up in a town that had</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.150" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">transfer a transfer station right and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.910" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">but it was the 90s you had to be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:09.330" style="s2">committed to taking her stuff there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:13.080" style="s2">it was basically only paper and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.330" end="00:08:15.470" style="s2">cardboard and the returnable type of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.080" end="00:08:19.970" style="s2">cans and bottles</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.470" end="00:08:23.100" style="s2">the irony BCE where I am the province is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.970" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">the environmental province or the you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.100" end="00:08:28.680" style="s2">know tree huggers and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2">environmentalists and Alberta next to us</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.680" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">is an oil-producing province and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">more like Texas yeah every time I go</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:40.620" style="s2">there I&#39;m astounded by how amazing their</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">recycling program is because they know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:44.250" style="s2">that people aren&#39;t committed to it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">you have to be able to put all of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.250" end="00:08:48.780" style="s2">recycling in something and they sort it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:50.610" style="s2">rather than here where you need people</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.780" end="00:08:52.680" style="s2">to have a degree and recycling into</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.610" end="00:08:54.210" style="s2">nowhere to recycle things and so then</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.680" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like oh it&#39;s plastic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.210" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">want for</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">notes they recycle it and then it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:59.779" style="s2">becomes someone else&#39;s problem for promo</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:02.630" style="s2">right that it&#39;s actually no we only</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.779" end="00:09:04.670" style="s2">recycle this portion so it&#39;s the like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.630" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">the more and they said I&#39;ve said a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.670" end="00:09:13.130" style="s2">we need to design recycling systems for</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">lazy non environmentalists not the pro</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">productive environmentalists right like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:18.230" style="s2">I will wash every container I will look</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">at the number on it I don&#39;t know its</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.230" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">container it goes into it&#39;s too much too</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">much for you oh and so and why are there</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2">ten different kinds of plastics like why</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:28.850" style="s2">do we have all of these in there if</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:32.210" style="s2">they&#39;re not glass and they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.850" end="00:09:35.089" style="s2">broken down and there are ways to turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.210" end="00:09:36.830" style="s2">kelp and things into plastic lakes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.089" end="00:09:38.630" style="s2">then if if those things are truly</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.830" end="00:09:41.630" style="s2">compostable why aren&#39;t we doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.630" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">instead of this petroleum by-product we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.630" end="00:09:45.830" style="s2">made all these uses from petroleum or</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">now we have to build pretty like yep</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.830" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">petroleum so we can have fertilizer so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:51.950" style="s2">we can have the plastics plastics are</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">great I mean they&#39;ve helped us in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.950" end="00:09:56.029" style="s2">of ways but there&#39;s alternatives there</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:58.460" style="s2">are things we can do that can be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.029" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">pros of plastic without all of them the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.460" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">bad things and of course we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:05.270" style="s2">about those in our next section what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:07.030" style="s2">want the future to look like but second</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.270" end="00:10:11.690" style="s2">opinion can I say one more quick thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.030" end="00:10:12.980" style="s2">absolutely okay also we do or we have in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.690" end="00:10:15.020" style="s2">the past we don&#39;t think we are anymore</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.980" end="00:10:17.510" style="s2">but we were just sending our recycling</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.020" end="00:10:19.580" style="s2">to like China for them to sort through</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.510" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">and you do whatever and they had to stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.580" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">letting us because we&#39;re so terrible at</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.220" end="00:10:27.260" style="s2">it was like dirty and we had the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.110" end="00:10:29.780" style="s2">things and then so like you said I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.260" end="00:10:32.330" style="s2">totally agree we need new systems actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.780" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">at both ends okay I guess I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.330" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">into the next area which is so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:39.530" style="s2">store here which does is what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">currently do it&#39;s called the I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.530" end="00:10:42.200" style="s2">even know what it&#39;s called mystic oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.970" end="00:10:44.600" style="s2">that one&#39;s the soap shop and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.200" end="00:10:46.310" style="s2">there&#39;s one next to it and the idea is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.600" end="00:10:49.130" style="s2">zero-waste grocery store that you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.310" end="00:10:50.420" style="s2">bring your stuff to and they&#39;ll fill it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.130" end="00:10:52.790" style="s2">up and you&#39;re only paid for the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:54.620" style="s2">what you&#39;re filling it up for great but</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.790" end="00:10:56.360" style="s2">there&#39;s one in Vancouver which means I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.620" end="00:11:01.220" style="s2">have to go to it is that really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.360" end="00:11:02.510" style="s2">right like if if I if everyone brings</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.220" end="00:11:04.250" style="s2">their own container they have to weigh</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.510" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">in know every container if we do if</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.250" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">everyone used mason jars they&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:10.460" style="s2">equivalent in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.740" style="s2">then we could you know like to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.460" end="00:11:14.210" style="s2">Universal ones that that there is a cost</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.740" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">to what we currently do it just like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.210" end="00:11:18.140" style="s2">environmental side it&#39;s all on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:20.150" style="s2">environmentalists like we pay more so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.140" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">that we can get recycled products why do</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.150" end="00:11:24.260" style="s2">you pay more for recycled toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.390" style="s2">than non recyclable a paper when there</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.260" end="00:11:28.250" style="s2">is enough paper products to be made into</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.390" end="00:11:29.780" style="s2">recycled toilet paper it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.250" end="00:11:31.400" style="s2">downgraded thing right you take paper</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.610" end="00:11:39.770" style="s2">paper clearly but nothing but still we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.120" end="00:11:42.140" style="s2">have enough paper that we could we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.770" end="00:11:44.060" style="s2">every all of it could be recycled or we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.140" end="00:11:46.760" style="s2">could make them locally right what did</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.060" end="00:11:49.220" style="s2">you again next section future future</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.760" end="00:11:50.810" style="s2">yeah I mean play papers the least of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.220" end="00:11:53.090" style="s2">issues isn&#39;t it really I mean paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.810" end="00:11:55.460" style="s2">thought itself out one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.090" end="00:11:57.140" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s not that big a deal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.460" end="00:11:59.570" style="s2">the toxic stuff and it&#39;s the non</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.140" end="00:12:01.280" style="s2">biodegradable stuff you know the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.570" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">that accumulates in the environment over</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.280" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">time this is I mean just just just one</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">more thing on the notion of recycling</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.310" end="00:12:14.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to say I&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.390" end="00:12:16.040" style="s2">recycling but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pissing in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.030" end="00:12:20.150" style="s2">the wind because what it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.040" end="00:12:22.760" style="s2">a it&#39;s been tacked on to a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.150" end="00:12:24.590" style="s2">flawed concept right in an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.760" end="00:12:26.150" style="s2">try and fix it but it can&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.590" end="00:12:28.670" style="s2">because the thing that&#39;s been stuck onto</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.150" end="00:12:31.010" style="s2">is a piece of poop in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.670" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">right and so there is no fixing it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.010" end="00:12:37.400" style="s2">the thing though I think way too much</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:39.290" style="s2">hope if you like is placed in the notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.400" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">of recycling it is nothing more than a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.290" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">band-aid that&#39;s all it is and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:46.730" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t there and I know this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:48.290" style="s2">maybe this is a good sort of segue into</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.730" end="00:12:51.910" style="s2">the next sections it&#39;s about time to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.290" end="00:12:55.250" style="s2">move into it anyway right but yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.910" end="00:12:57.470" style="s2">the the recycle ability or reusability</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.250" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">of any given material whether its</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.470" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">packaging or not needs to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">initial design process at the products</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:07.430" style="s2">itself right yeah these these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:08.810" style="s2">must go hand in hand and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.430" end="00:13:09.950" style="s2">what you were saying before Jubilee is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.810" end="00:13:11.060" style="s2">really interesting point about going</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.950" end="00:13:12.470" style="s2">down with your own contains to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.060" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">grocery store everyone goes with their</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.470" end="00:13:15.140" style="s2">own different containers and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2"> mess right and so you need some</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.140" end="00:13:18.950" style="s2">standardization of the containers that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:20.300" style="s2">people are bringing down there so but</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.950" end="00:13:21.830" style="s2">again this is easily fixed right the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.300" end="00:13:23.750" style="s2">first time you buy corn flow</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.830" end="00:13:25.250" style="s2">you pay an extra two bucks or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.750" end="00:13:27.020" style="s2">you get a corn flakes container which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.250" end="00:13:28.730" style="s2">a standardized thing and then from now</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.020" end="00:13:30.020" style="s2">on every time you buy cornflakes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.730" end="00:13:31.670" style="s2">fill up that container and if you ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.020" end="00:13:32.990" style="s2">want to stop buying cornflakes you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.670" end="00:13:34.790" style="s2">get your 2 bucks back at the other end</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:36.620" style="s2">for the container if you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.790" end="00:13:39.410" style="s2">know well or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.620" end="00:13:41.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s really really easy I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.410" end="00:13:44.210" style="s2">why more of that isn&#39;t on it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.240" end="00:13:46.190" style="s2">super simple that is so now yeah good</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.210" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">segue let&#39;s talk about what our ideal</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.190" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">version of the future looks like for</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.290" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">packaging and materials and again they</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have to match they can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">different we want you to be democratic</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:13:58.520" style="s2">agree on our future before we start</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.880" style="s2">moving towards it but what does your</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.520" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">future materials and packaging look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.880" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">in an ideal world I&#39;d have to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:10.070" style="s2">Eric it should start at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:12.260" style="s2">and I almost feel like manufacturers</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.070" end="00:14:14.630" style="s2">should have to take back their packaging</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.260" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">because I think if that were the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.630" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">then they would find ways to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:22.580" style="s2">packaging I know we ship stuff overseas</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:24.200" style="s2">to get it here or wherever and so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.580" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">need more packaging but seriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.200" end="00:14:28.690" style="s2">sometimes you buy something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.820" end="00:14:31.160" style="s2">like where&#39;s my camera you know just get</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">some little blocks like this and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.160" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">so much styrofoam and plastic and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.390" style="s2">then you have nowhere to take it so not</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:43.070" style="s2">only do I think manufacturers need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.390" end="00:14:45.580" style="s2">plan for the end or and and/or I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.070" end="00:14:49.970" style="s2">it would be great for us to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.580" end="00:14:51.890" style="s2">community projects where we decide ok</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.970" end="00:14:54.740" style="s2">because I feel like we&#39;re on the verge</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.890" end="00:14:57.170" style="s2">of changing from this wasteful Society</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:15:01.130" style="s2">to a society that does have the loops</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:15:03.500" style="s2">and does figure out ways to utilize what</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:05.660" style="s2">we make but I think we&#39;re on the you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.500" end="00:15:08.830" style="s2">know we&#39;re kind of will we go that way</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.660" end="00:15:12.260" style="s2">or will we just die in a pile of garbage</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.830" end="00:15:15.290" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s possible through one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.260" end="00:15:17.270" style="s2">the other isn&#39;t it only two options we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.290" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">figure out were part of an ecosystem or</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.270" end="00:15:21.200" style="s2">we dial in a pile of our own garbage I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:22.940" style="s2">was laughing at the beginning when Eric</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.200" end="00:15:25.130" style="s2">was I think I said something about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.940" end="00:15:26.840" style="s2">were crazy right and I was laughing</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.130" end="00:15:29.030" style="s2">because I was like yeah we treat</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.840" end="00:15:30.350" style="s2">like right like even what comes out</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.030" end="00:15:32.930" style="s2">of our bodies which is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.350" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">natural ecosystem it&#39;s like toxic and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.930" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">flush it away</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.400" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like the amount that we like get or</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">even our nitrogen that we pee away when</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:46.470" style="s2">we have very little like poop is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:47.910" style="s2">actually gross it is actually deadly to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:51.180" style="s2">us at the same time that it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.910" end="00:15:52.620" style="s2">for crops but P is like our urine is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.180" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">that one of the best sources of nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.620" end="00:15:59.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we get from fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">and so in my version of the future I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.100" end="00:16:04.710" style="s2">would like to see everybody have access</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:06.450" style="s2">to that knowledge of like that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.710" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">collecting RP and putting it in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.450" end="00:16:13.529" style="s2">Gardens if you&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:15.690" style="s2">pharmaceuticals um to be able to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.529" end="00:16:17.070" style="s2">what materials are being used where</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.690" end="00:16:19.560" style="s2">because right now in the for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.070" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">system it&#39;s not designed for closely you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.560" end="00:16:23.490" style="s2">don&#39;t have to take back your packaging</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:24.900" style="s2">and so you&#39;re going to design it so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.490" end="00:16:26.730" style="s2">it just goes out into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.900" end="00:16:29.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come back and that&#39;s you if your</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.730" end="00:16:30.570" style="s2">competitors unless that is your price</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.070" end="00:16:33.300" style="s2">point right there&#39;s there&#39;s a milk</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.570" end="00:16:35.310" style="s2">company here called Avalon and they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.300" end="00:16:37.740" style="s2">glass bottles if every glass bottle is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.310" end="00:16:39.540" style="s2">dollar so you take it back and you you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.740" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">know they keep reusing it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.540" end="00:16:43.140" style="s2">recycle them they wash them and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:44.640" style="s2">like old-fashioned oh I&#39;m really sorry</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.140" end="00:16:50.940" style="s2">to interrupt but that used to be really</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.640" end="00:16:53.370" style="s2">widespread that was great it was simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.940" end="00:16:55.529" style="s2">and why did that stop and yet their milk</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.370" end="00:16:57.000" style="s2">containers are kind of like baby</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.529" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">they leak right when you take the lid</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.000" end="00:17:00.810" style="s2">off and put it back on you can&#39;t reuse</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:02.400" style="s2">it but there&#39;s a like that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.810" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">there&#39;s an improvement in the way that a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.400" end="00:17:05.429" style="s2">packaging can be like let&#39;s say I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">inventor and I come up with the best</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.429" end="00:17:08.760" style="s2">packaging this is you know this glass</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2">that&#39;s actually got a screw on cap</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.760" end="00:17:12.780" style="s2">without Avalon&#39;s gotta trade their</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:14.339" style="s2">change their entire Factory and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:15.630" style="s2">unless I can manage if I&#39;m just doing a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.339" end="00:17:17.970" style="s2">Babylon it&#39;s not going to work I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.630" end="00:17:21.390" style="s2">it for the entire milk industry so with</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.970" end="00:17:24.420" style="s2">narrow same advancement in materials</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.390" end="00:17:26.069" style="s2">that were actually looking at is it an</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.420" end="00:17:27.569" style="s2">advancement what is the energy that went</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.069" end="00:17:29.160" style="s2">into it what is the water what is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.569" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">production that comes out right what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.160" end="00:17:33.510" style="s2">the waste products and when there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:36.570" style="s2">best idea how do we move forward I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.510" end="00:17:38.940" style="s2">love something like James Jones&#39;s cube</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.570" end="00:17:40.950" style="s2">spawn which the idea is we&#39;re recycling</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.940" end="00:17:43.020" style="s2">right here you&#39;re taking your plastic</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.950" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">water bottle and turning it into a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.020" end="00:17:46.830" style="s2">printable material and although that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:47.340" style="s2">not a closed loop because you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.830" end="00:17:49.920" style="s2">going to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.340" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">like plastic isn&#39;t designed like that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.920" end="00:17:54.750" style="s2">click like health might be I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:56.910" style="s2">if we can if something costs very little</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.750" end="00:17:59.100" style="s2">energy to create and can be either</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.910" end="00:18:01.920" style="s2">recycled or composted and the new things</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.100" end="00:18:04.800" style="s2">made we could have the packaging right</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.920" end="00:18:06.660" style="s2">but a combination between actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.800" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">packaging that closes the loop there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.660" end="00:18:11.850" style="s2">like an ends reusable containers that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:13.260" style="s2">are standardized right that are hey we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.850" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">all have this cereal thing they all fit</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.260" end="00:18:16.680" style="s2">beautifully in my cupboard they all I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have a brand on there</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.680" end="00:18:21.270" style="s2">because the brand isn&#39;t what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.140" end="00:18:22.950" style="s2">it&#39;s then I like cornflakes right or</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.270" end="00:18:25.230" style="s2">then I like corn pops or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.950" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">actually and then how do we make that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.230" end="00:18:29.820" style="s2">better and better but you can go get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">stuff recited refilled and then bring it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.820" end="00:18:33.420" style="s2">back where it&#39;s not we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:36.060" style="s2">this in this plastic and looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.420" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">actual numbers and data is my ideal</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.060" end="00:18:42.510" style="s2">version of the future I&#39;m sorry Eric yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">no no no apologies I just I just had</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.510" end="00:18:46.200" style="s2">something right now the second I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:49.830" style="s2">very happy that you finished so if I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.200" end="00:18:56.070" style="s2">looking in patient be patient when I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.830" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">that so I assume so ya know two things</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.070" end="00:19:02.010" style="s2">firstly the reusable packaging right</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:03.900" style="s2">plastic is actually ideal for that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">fact that it doesn&#39;t break down is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.900" end="00:19:07.350" style="s2">great for that right you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:09.630" style="s2">want you know for things like piping</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.350" end="00:19:10.830" style="s2">water pipes you know I mean I I live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.630" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">the mountains and that water pipe</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.830" end="00:19:14.700" style="s2">connects us to the mountain spring and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:16.800" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s really good that those</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.700" end="00:19:19.310" style="s2">things don&#39;t degrade Rio what water</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.800" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">coming out of my taps every day so but</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.310" end="00:19:23.880" style="s2">there is no need for that level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:26.190" style="s2">durability in most packaging right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.880" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">mean packaging is primarily disposable</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.190" end="00:19:29.880" style="s2">and hemp I didn&#39;t actually know about</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">kelp but I do know a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.880" end="00:19:34.140" style="s2">hemp polymers and hemp polymers are</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:35.610" style="s2">exactly that they&#39;re not very durable</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.140" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">but they&#39;re good enough for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.610" end="00:19:41.010" style="s2">weeks to get stuff from you know planter</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.690" style="s2">shelf at home kind of thing and then it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.010" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">rots away in the space of a few weeks a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.690" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">couple of months kind of thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.830" end="00:19:46.140" style="s2">it means you can just throw it away in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:47.700" style="s2">your garden you can put it on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.140" end="00:19:50.460" style="s2">compost heap you know what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.700" end="00:19:52.290" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah and it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.460" end="00:19:53.580" style="s2">more expensive this is the thing and as</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.290" end="00:19:55.710" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember which one of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.580" end="00:19:58.050" style="s2">sitting identify the necessity for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.710" end="00:20:01.050" style="s2">use of petroleum products right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">under our current industrial model but</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.050" end="00:20:05.700" style="s2">hemp has all kinds of other benefits</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:08.910" style="s2">apart from the polymers you can make</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:10.680" style="s2">from it the growing of hemp rejuvenate</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.910" end="00:20:12.660" style="s2">the soil in which it is growing while</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.680" end="00:20:15.000" style="s2">it&#39;s growing there right so it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.660" end="00:20:16.620" style="s2">the regeneration of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.000" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">disgusting that we&#39;ve done to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.620" end="00:20:19.800" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:21.630" style="s2">planting large amounts of hemp using</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.800" end="00:20:23.850" style="s2">that as a building material a clothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.630" end="00:20:26.040" style="s2">material a polymer material and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.850" end="00:20:28.650" style="s2">regenerate the environment that we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.040" end="00:20:30.450" style="s2">toxified you know it leeches leeches all</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.650" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">that toxic straight out of the soil</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.450" end="00:20:37.740" style="s2">it&#39;s brilliant so yeah I mean hemp is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:39.690" style="s2">big big big part of a global answer to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.740" end="00:20:41.460" style="s2">all of this in my opinion and the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.690" end="00:20:43.620" style="s2">so hemp is it like a freakin miracle</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.460" end="00:20:46.980" style="s2">plant so it kelp is pretty cool and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.620" end="00:20:49.470" style="s2">is mushrooms mycelium can also do a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.980" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">bunch including breaking down like</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.470" end="00:20:54.150" style="s2">cigarettes and stuff that is like which</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">people repeat we can probably solve</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.150" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">every packaging problem and corn but</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">just having that access to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.650" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:06.300" style="s2">um like if I manufacture something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.650" end="00:21:08.100" style="s2">not gonna be the best at knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.300" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">package it right like if I&#39;m a raspberry</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.100" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">grower I might grow the best raspberries</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:15.390" style="s2">in the world but they need to get to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:16.530" style="s2">in their pristine format so I need some</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.390" end="00:21:18.810" style="s2">kind of packaging and that&#39;s where a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.530" end="00:21:20.160" style="s2">brad was was well I&#39;ll send this too</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.810" end="00:21:21.420" style="s2">which is why we&#39;re doing this because</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.160" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s talking about packaging and he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.420" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">he&#39;s a nutritionist and he wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2">his packaging in fruit what is it your</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">sir being a fruit right so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:34.410" style="s2">like your strawberries are actually in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">four servings because you&#39;ve got four</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.410" end="00:21:39.030" style="s2">servings I&#39;m like that&#39;s pretty cool and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:41.700" style="s2">at the same time that need to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.030" end="00:21:43.470" style="s2">something that niche makes it less</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.700" end="00:21:45.240" style="s2">universal right which means that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.470" end="00:21:47.250" style="s2">can&#39;t stack them and take up less room</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.240" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">and stuff but at the same time you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.250" end="00:21:51.510" style="s2">have that if it&#39;s built into the system</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">right each one is 3d printed it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.510" end="00:21:55.350" style="s2">matter you can how how much do we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:21:57.450" style="s2">to mass-produce this so it brings the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.350" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">cost down right like hemp anything is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.450" end="00:22:02.910" style="s2">astronomical like it&#39;s like why does a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:05.880" style="s2">plastic thing of cutlery cost a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.910" end="00:22:08.730" style="s2">for a hundred in most places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.880" end="00:22:10.980" style="s2"> nuts you know as you say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.730" end="00:22:11.990" style="s2">gift from God this stuff and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.980" end="00:22:14.420" style="s2">allowed to grow</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.990" end="00:22:16.220" style="s2">just why right the paper and pulp</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:17.750" style="s2">industry was like no which is also what</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.220" end="00:22:20.690" style="s2">you had said earlier about the paper</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.750" end="00:22:22.580" style="s2">industry right then it&#39;s kind of a like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.690" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">it it&#39;s not the issue and yet it still</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.580" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">is right we go and cut down old-growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:29.690" style="s2">forests and make phonebooks less phone</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:32.600" style="s2">books now but like paper for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:35.300" style="s2">stupid purpose we don&#39;t it&#39;s a reusable</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.600" end="00:22:36.920" style="s2">resource right it&#39;s or sir every new</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.300" end="00:22:39.080" style="s2">able resource we don&#39;t treat it as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.920" end="00:22:40.520" style="s2">renewable resource we both cut down</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.080" end="00:22:42.920" style="s2">old-growth forests make toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.520" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">instead of reusing what we have we use</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.920" end="00:22:48.050" style="s2">it beyond sustainability and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:50.420" style="s2">pick plastic right like we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.050" end="00:22:53.240" style="s2">know we created a new polymer we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.420" end="00:22:56.300" style="s2">like we don&#39;t do any of it right like as</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.240" end="00:22:57.860" style="s2">a species and yet the informations there</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.300" end="00:22:59.540" style="s2">and if we have access to the information</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.860" end="00:23:02.120" style="s2">I think that is a big stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.540" end="00:23:03.350" style="s2">there are starch and cellulose polymers</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.120" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">as well that have been around for</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.350" end="00:23:06.590" style="s2">decades I mean a really a long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:08.180" style="s2">which are also going to grow they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.590" end="00:23:10.460" style="s2">as strong you can&#39;t carry much weight in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.180" end="00:23:12.260" style="s2">them they break you know but for certain</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.460" end="00:23:14.630" style="s2">applications they&#39;d be absolutely fine</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.260" end="00:23:16.460" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s like if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.630" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">medical it like right now during Koba 19</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.460" end="00:23:19.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve a little bit thrown our</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:20.990" style="s2">environmentalism out the window right</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.340" end="00:23:23.180" style="s2">you go grocery shopping and it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.990" end="00:23:25.340" style="s2">you can&#39;t even bring your own bags you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.180" end="00:23:27.380" style="s2">have to use the plastic ones like why</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.340" end="00:23:29.570" style="s2">are we using paper then like plugging it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.380" end="00:23:31.550" style="s2">why we went for making it illegal to now</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.080" end="00:24:21.340" style="s2">interwove in&#39; it&#39;s not working what we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:23.759" style="s2">like to see happen you know i was just</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.340" end="00:24:29.429" style="s2">talk and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.759" end="00:24:32.429" style="s2">a story came to mind every year with my</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.429" end="00:24:36.119" style="s2">wife we go to this this place in Wyoming</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.429" end="00:24:38.279" style="s2">it&#39;s called Fort Bridger and it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.119" end="00:24:41.479" style="s2">a mountain man rendezvous and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.279" end="00:24:46.769" style="s2">of like a wannabe Burning Man for</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.479" end="00:24:49.649" style="s2">mountain men reenactment and but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.769" end="00:24:51.299" style="s2">interesting about it is everything kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.649" end="00:24:53.479" style="s2">of holds that ethos of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.299" end="00:24:57.119" style="s2">talking about kind of this reusable</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.479" end="00:24:59.309" style="s2">reusable packaging because you know if</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.119" end="00:25:00.839" style="s2">you had to do things back then I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.309" end="00:25:02.940" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.839" end="00:25:05.669" style="s2">technologies and you have to reuse every</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.940" end="00:25:08.549" style="s2">single scrap material you have and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.669" end="00:25:11.099" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.549" end="00:25:14.009" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this route there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.099" end="00:25:16.259" style="s2">there&#39;s this famous root beer stand that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.009" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">they make homemade root beer and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.259" end="00:25:21.960" style="s2">have these beautiful glass bottles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:24.089" style="s2">people have people still have their</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.960" end="00:25:28.379" style="s2">glass bottles that they purchased from</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.089" end="00:25:30.389" style="s2">from this root beer stand for like 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.379" end="00:25:32.969" style="s2">years it&#39;s incredible and so it just</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.389" end="00:25:35.639" style="s2">goes to show you know if you spend time</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.969" end="00:25:37.979" style="s2">with packaging if you if you make it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.639" end="00:25:40.739" style="s2">beautiful if you make it reusable then</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.979" end="00:25:43.529" style="s2">you kind of build that into the design</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.739" end="00:25:45.210" style="s2">characteristics of where you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.529" end="00:25:50.849" style="s2">to throw this thing away or you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.210" end="00:25:53.460" style="s2">find the different use for it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.849" end="00:25:55.109" style="s2">not just that it&#39;s it&#39;s other products</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.460" end="00:25:57.599" style="s2">that you would buy there I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.109" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">come in these kind of handmade totes or</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.599" end="00:26:02.369" style="s2">you know that kind of thing so I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:03.139" style="s2">wanted to share that with you I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.369" end="00:26:06.359" style="s2">thought that was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.139" end="00:26:09.979" style="s2">interesting point to kind of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.359" end="00:26:12.179" style="s2">think it&#39;s okay if we go old-school</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.979" end="00:26:13.979" style="s2">over-the-top with packaging right make</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.179" end="00:26:17.759" style="s2">the packaging itself a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.979" end="00:26:19.259" style="s2">yeah yeah I know I know that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.759" end="00:26:21.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s a lovely it&#39;s a really lovely</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.259" end="00:26:23.429" style="s2">notion just the the irony like I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.599" end="00:26:26.070" style="s2">about reusable things in my life and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.429" end="00:26:28.349" style="s2">Avalon bottles are usable are are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.070" end="00:26:31.409" style="s2">they&#39;re like old old milk bottles so but</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.349" end="00:26:32.609" style="s2">then does it cost Avalon a dollar to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.409" end="00:26:37.140" style="s2">make them because if everyone&#39;s keeping</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.609" end="00:26:40.260" style="s2">them is not really 100 maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.140" end="00:26:43.049" style="s2">absolutely and then from box yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.260" end="00:26:44.730" style="s2">there&#39;s frog box which is like the green</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.049" end="00:26:46.410" style="s2">boxes there&#39;s like a moving company here</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.730" end="00:26:49.500" style="s2">and they you rent the box it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.410" end="00:26:51.270" style="s2">plastic photo foldable box and when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.500" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">get your spud delivery they charge you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.270" end="00:26:58.260" style="s2">$5 but buying one of those is like $20</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:27:00.360" style="s2">I&#39;m like maybe I just don&#39;t return it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.260" end="00:27:02.250" style="s2">like which wasn&#39;t a plan it was largest</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.360" end="00:27:04.049" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get my next cut order and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.250" end="00:27:05.670" style="s2">they&#39;re delivering in cardboard just</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.049" end="00:27:07.590" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many people to comb</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.670" end="00:27:09.270" style="s2">it 19 looking for grocery delivery but</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.590" end="00:27:10.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like that price point if you make</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.270" end="00:27:12.570" style="s2">it too much of a work of art people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.740" end="00:27:14.490" style="s2">gonna keep it without returning it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.570" end="00:27:16.530" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of defeats the purpose but</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">there is if it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s nice to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.530" end="00:27:19.980" style="s2">have and that&#39;s where when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:22.470" style="s2">have branding right this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.980" end="00:27:24.510" style="s2">stupid Tupperware container but if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.470" end="00:27:26.730" style="s2">weren&#39;t concerned about standardization</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.510" end="00:27:27.330" style="s2">and I cared about the beautifulness of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.730" end="00:27:29.700" style="s2">my kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:30.929" style="s2">I could have matching this right</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.700" end="00:27:33.690" style="s2">everywhere in my kitchen didn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.929" end="00:27:35.910" style="s2">whether those corn flakes or or kelp or</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.690" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">whatever is in it it&#39;s it looks a nice</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.910" end="00:27:38.760" style="s2">right and that would be less and less</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:40.049" style="s2">Saturdays hm but the size might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.760" end="00:27:42.299" style="s2">staggered the size weight might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.049" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">standard and the colors numeron sort or</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.299" end="00:27:45.570" style="s2">those kind of things I like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.700" style="s2">standardization I want my kitchen to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.570" end="00:27:50.010" style="s2">make sense like I want like the pots and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.700" end="00:27:51.570" style="s2">pans and lids to commitment like I want</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.010" end="00:27:54.419" style="s2">standardization and other people like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.570" end="00:27:57.330" style="s2">diversity and uniqueness but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.419" end="00:28:00.090" style="s2">think it&#39;s just important to to build</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.330" end="00:28:03.900" style="s2">that into the design because I you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.090" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">I I love if you could control people but</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.900" end="00:28:08.850" style="s2">unfortunately you can&#39;t and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:11.910" style="s2">we will all recycle we will all do our</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.850" end="00:28:15.030" style="s2">part but we are not the majority and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.910" end="00:28:17.130" style="s2">you kind of have to make the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.030" end="00:28:19.500" style="s2">consumer not even think about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.130" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">process not make it a decision that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.500" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">gonna you know set them back even a few</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.160" style="s2">bucks you just does that make sense it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:28.140" style="s2">needs to be kind of seamlessly</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.160" end="00:28:30.059" style="s2">integrated into it where they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.140" end="00:28:33.270" style="s2">not even making these decisions because</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.059" end="00:28:35.809" style="s2">that make sense yeah yeah yeah I know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.270" end="00:28:39.990" style="s2">said earlier stupidly</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.809" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">yeah to take us off in a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.990" end="00:28:44.549" style="s2">different direction another story occurs</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">to me as Matt was talking there this was</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.549" end="00:28:47.429" style="s2">on the news in England a few years back</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:49.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a family somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.429" end="00:28:50.900" style="s2">country is that a family of five right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.500" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">two adults three kids</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.900" end="00:28:55.490" style="s2">and they have a ceremony every year on</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">the 31st of December every year they</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.490" end="00:28:59.690" style="s2">have a ceremony where they throw out</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:01.460" style="s2">their rubbish for the year and they in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.690" end="00:29:04.190" style="s2">the course of one year they aqui they</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.460" end="00:29:05.960" style="s2">they accumulate one black bag full of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.190" end="00:29:08.900" style="s2">rubbish that they can&#39;t in some way</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:10.760" style="s2">reuse or I&#39;m talking about recycling</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.900" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">within their household not dumping in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.760" end="00:29:16.160" style="s2">the recycling bin but but but actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.340" end="00:29:17.450" style="s2">making use of so minimizing the amount</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.160" end="00:29:19.820" style="s2">you know obviously when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.450" end="00:29:21.020" style="s2">buy stuff they minimize the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.820" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">packaging and the stuff that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.020" end="00:29:25.370" style="s2">buying and they have loads of inventive</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:26.810" style="s2">ways to do now what the reason I tell</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.370" end="00:29:29.660" style="s2">this story is not just the story itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.810" end="00:29:31.610" style="s2">which is kind of cool but also another</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.660" end="00:29:32.870" style="s2">way of apart from making it like super</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.610" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">simple so people don&#39;t have to think</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.870" end="00:29:36.950" style="s2">about it another way of doing it which</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:38.420" style="s2">could be just as effective but in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.950" end="00:29:40.790" style="s2">complete opposite direction is to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.420" end="00:29:42.230" style="s2">it really really a big thing and make it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.790" end="00:29:44.780" style="s2">into a competition you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.230" end="00:29:47.480" style="s2">like make it a game if I the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.780" end="00:29:49.720" style="s2">waste reduction you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.480" end="00:29:52.790" style="s2">motivate people in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.720" end="00:29:54.110" style="s2">ironically slightly under on equate the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.790" end="00:29:55.370" style="s2">cohousing that I&#39;m part of they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.110" end="00:29:56.660" style="s2">amazing at recycling and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.370" end="00:29:58.160" style="s2">recycling like a lot of the stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.660" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">have to bring to the transfer station</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.160" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">they have there but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:03.490" style="s2">was they were like let&#39;s try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:05.660" style="s2">this down right let&#39;s have less soft</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.490" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">recycling and I&#39;m like how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.660" end="00:30:09.470" style="s2">that in Vancouver because the option</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:11.870" style="s2">that is people throw it out instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:14.360" style="s2">recycling it right it&#39;s like so that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.870" end="00:30:16.070" style="s2">can feel good I&#39;m recycling less like</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.360" end="00:30:18.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like are you doing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.070" end="00:30:20.990" style="s2">to produce less or to look like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.950" end="00:30:23.090" style="s2">produce less and it&#39;s like those weird</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.990" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">incentives of like if you make this into</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.090" end="00:30:27.770" style="s2">a contest then you know I remember there</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:29.240" style="s2">was one of the TV shows did that where</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.770" end="00:30:31.370" style="s2">they had to carry their trash around and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.240" end="00:30:32.840" style="s2">they would like throw it out at school</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.370" end="00:30:34.160" style="s2">and do and it was like they were tried</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.840" end="00:30:35.930" style="s2">as a family to see who had the least</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.160" end="00:30:37.550" style="s2">about sand they&#39;ve gotta win something</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.930" end="00:30:40.670" style="s2">and they we kept talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.550" end="00:30:42.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s like that&#39;s basically solitaire</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.670" end="00:30:47.090" style="s2">that kind of thing is exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.050" end="00:30:48.710" style="s2">cheating solitaire or at gold yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.090" end="00:30:50.870" style="s2">right we&#39;re in the 30 minute mark which</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.710" end="00:30:53.480" style="s2">means now we go on to the portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.870" end="00:30:56.780" style="s2">actual adjacent possible so what could</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.480" end="00:30:58.760" style="s2">we do without necessarily changing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.780" end="00:31:01.550" style="s2">regulations in the government if we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.760" end="00:31:05.650" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 how could we</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.550" end="00:31:05.650" style="s2">improve packaging on materials</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.169" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">it seems often hard questions out here</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.299" end="00:31:19.580" style="s2">good packaging I mean the vast vast vast</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.910" end="00:31:21.140" style="s2">vast majority of packaging comes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.580" end="00:31:22.790" style="s2">mass-produced goods right which are</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.140" end="00:31:25.100" style="s2">produced in vast quantities in a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.790" end="00:31:29.500" style="s2">few locations and so it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.100" end="00:31:33.230" style="s2">the only sort of small-scale way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.500" end="00:31:35.000" style="s2">combating that is localizing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.230" end="00:31:35.960" style="s2">production of the goods which are then</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.000" end="00:31:38.210" style="s2">going to get packaged and delivered</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.960" end="00:31:40.370" style="s2">right and it&#39;s the only way the only way</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.210" end="00:31:42.380" style="s2">that you then have any kind of control</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.370" end="00:31:45.380" style="s2">over how those goods are packaged and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.380" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">delivered and yeah I mean it you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.380" end="00:31:48.860" style="s2">there is the motion of the only power we</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.179" style="s2">have as consumer as consumers is where</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.860" end="00:31:51.710" style="s2">we spend our money and there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.179" end="00:31:54.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a good deal of truth in that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.710" end="00:31:56.840" style="s2">so but you know that&#39;s that&#39;s almost at</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.470" end="00:31:58.610" style="s2">an individual level I supply here we go</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.840" end="00:32:00.049" style="s2">ah this has just occurred to me so with</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.610" end="00:32:01.580" style="s2">ten thousand people in ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.049" end="00:32:03.500" style="s2">dollars this will be right up your alley</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.580" end="00:32:07.570" style="s2">Jubilee this is this this is your kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.500" end="00:32:12.110" style="s2">of solution is to create an information</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.570" end="00:32:14.450" style="s2">system that people could see you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.110" end="00:32:16.940" style="s2">what kind of packaging is used in</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.450" end="00:32:19.040" style="s2">particular goods that that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.940" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">right and and use that to inform the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:22.790" style="s2">choices that they make when they buy</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:24.710" style="s2">things I mean some of its obvious right</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.790" end="00:32:26.540" style="s2">I mean you can just look at two packets</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.710" end="00:32:28.790" style="s2">of biscuits one of them is just you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.540" end="00:32:30.590" style="s2">some biscuits is wrapped in thin plastic</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.790" end="00:32:32.390" style="s2">just the two biscuits that&#39;s it another</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.590" end="00:32:34.400" style="s2">one like I said before individual little</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.390" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">packet sets in a cardboard box which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.400" end="00:32:37.130" style="s2">then wrapped in plaid do you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:39.160" style="s2">mean it&#39;s so you can make these choices</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.130" end="00:32:40.970" style="s2">at an individual level but but but</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.160" end="00:32:43.580" style="s2">Jubilee mentioned before there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.970" end="00:32:45.080" style="s2">whatever 810 different kinds of plastics</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.580" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">in packaging some of which are much</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.080" end="00:32:49.250" style="s2">harder to disposable reuse or recycle</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">than others I don&#39;t know which are which</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.250" end="00:32:53.299" style="s2">you know that kind of information would</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:54.950" style="s2">be really useful to consumers you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.299" end="00:32:57.290" style="s2">to know which kind of product that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.950" end="00:32:58.760" style="s2">being used and okay it&#39;s not great but</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.290" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">at least I know it&#39;s better than that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.760" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">one right that sort of thing so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:04.820" style="s2">something like that there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">me and I don&#39;t know if this is a ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.820" end="00:33:09.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know but I guarantee this is my</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">my assumption of the Union or world is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.380" end="00:33:14.059" style="s2">that every problem is already solved</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:16.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just the person who already solved</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.059" end="00:33:16.980" style="s2">it is sitting in there like basement</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.130" end="00:33:18.600" style="s2">with no idea how to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.980" end="00:33:20.130" style="s2">out into the world and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.600" end="00:33:22.020" style="s2">packaging and materials that happens a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.130" end="00:33:23.460" style="s2">lot the people are like oh I came up</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.020" end="00:33:25.559" style="s2">with this new thing right there like an</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.460" end="00:33:27.450" style="s2">engineer in their hand they and I every</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.559" end="00:33:29.340" style="s2">time I have these soft recycled things</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.450" end="00:33:30.780" style="s2">I&#39;m like if only like if there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.340" end="00:33:32.700" style="s2">to make it out of callek a way to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.780" end="00:33:34.230" style="s2">it but also make it infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.700" end="00:33:37.290" style="s2">compostable right if it&#39;s just a plans</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.230" end="00:33:38.309" style="s2">and we if we knew how much stuff went in</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.290" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">then it could be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.309" end="00:33:41.340" style="s2">continually made because it is useful to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">have biscuits wrapped right when I send</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:45.929" style="s2">my kid to school if that ever happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:47.940" style="s2">again then to have that that like it</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.929" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">like I end up otherwise I end up using a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.940" end="00:33:51.210" style="s2">bank right or like a reusable one but</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:53.460" style="s2">then you have to wash it out if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.210" end="00:33:55.080" style="s2">have to wash it I can just take this put</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.460" end="00:33:56.520" style="s2">it in a machine and it comes back out to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.080" end="00:33:59.520" style="s2">wreath to wrap the next thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.520" end="00:34:01.530" style="s2">next thing then like then we&#39;ve closed</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.520" end="00:34:03.750" style="s2">the loop and again not possible to end</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.530" end="00:34:06.270" style="s2">those people but 10,000 people in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.750" end="00:34:09.450" style="s2">Vancouver could have The Container Store</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.270" end="00:34:11.070" style="s2">right deliver to your house all the</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.700" end="00:34:43.830" style="s2">suggested right the information the data</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.230" end="00:35:05.369" style="s2">bulk buy it when can we if I&#39;m buying</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.780" end="00:35:08.100" style="s2">rice that&#39;s coming in all this packaging</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.369" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">when can we both buy it so it comes in</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.100" end="00:35:12.030" style="s2">less packaging and put in mason jars</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.810" end="00:35:15.210" style="s2">there&#39;s many things we can do at 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.030" end="00:35:16.500" style="s2">people I just had another idea sorry I</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:24.210" style="s2">thought and this could be done at a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.710" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">smaller scale than tent that although</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.210" end="00:35:30.900" style="s2">you could scale it up to this right</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:33.059" style="s2">instead of 25 people going to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.900" end="00:35:35.609" style="s2">supermarket market buying 1 kilogram</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.589" end="00:35:47.279" style="s2">coordinating that yeah so a mechanism by</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.970" end="00:35:50.789" style="s2">which you can coordinate that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.279" end="00:35:56.309" style="s2">thing yeah another local hub of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.789" end="00:36:01.260" style="s2">store right in someone&#39;s garage it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.309" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">like it makes me think of this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">another kind of old timer example but</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:08.700" style="s2">but you know like the concept of an old</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:12.180" style="s2">general store and like you&#39;d go down to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.700" end="00:36:15.270" style="s2">the general store and you buy I need 20</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.180" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">pounds of flour and you know 40 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.270" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">of rice and stuff in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:30.900" style="s2">dynamic if you think about it not like</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:34.319" style="s2">if you come to the general store wanting</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.900" end="00:36:37.109" style="s2">20 pounds of flour it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.319" end="00:36:38.789" style="s2">responsibility to figure out well how am</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.109" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">I gonna get this home you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.789" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">mean so it&#39;s almost like situations like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.270" end="00:36:47.099" style="s2">that putting the responsibility on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:50.549" style="s2">consumer find your packaging find your</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.099" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">own bag this is why should this even be</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.549" end="00:37:03.150" style="s2">the responsibility you know of the of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:37:05.130" style="s2">the corporation or whatever what I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:06.539" style="s2">to the corporation it&#39;s left up to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.130" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">corporation otherwise we have like The</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.539" end="00:37:09.480" style="s2">Container Store in Vancouver where those</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:10.920" style="s2">that are environmentalists are gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.480" end="00:37:12.839" style="s2">out of their way with their containers</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.920" end="00:37:14.339" style="s2">to go there but most people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.839" end="00:37:16.680" style="s2">shop at Walmart in superstore and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.339" end="00:37:19.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna touch most people whereas</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.680" end="00:37:20.490" style="s2">if you were like 10 then we found 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.020" end="00:37:21.990" style="s2">people who care about the environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.490" end="00:37:24.119" style="s2">but they&#39;re not willing to pay a surplus</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.990" end="00:37:26.069" style="s2">and go across the city to get it how do</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.119" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">we get these things to you so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.069" end="00:37:30.990" style="s2">you&#39;re more I&#39;m not needing to recycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.960" end="00:37:33.089" style="s2">all of this stuff so that I can monitor</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.990" end="00:37:35.640" style="s2">how much recycling is going out so I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.089" end="00:37:39.329" style="s2">hopefully bring it down more and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.640" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">yeah that makes sense I like both of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.329" end="00:37:43.980" style="s2">those kind of the idea of your well all</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:47.550" style="s2">of what you&#39;ve said kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.980" end="00:37:49.830" style="s2">into my big system idea where each</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.550" end="00:37:52.590" style="s2">community has their hub or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.830" end="00:37:54.660" style="s2">people can go there to pick up like</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.590" end="00:37:57.090" style="s2">you&#39;re saying they&#39;re part of the bulk</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.660" end="00:38:00.450" style="s2">items that have been ordered when I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.090" end="00:38:01.260" style="s2">a kid we lived in the country and my</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.450" end="00:38:03.300" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.260" end="00:38:06.390" style="s2">there weren&#39;t stores anywhere near my</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.300" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">parents would basically they were a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.390" end="00:38:10.890" style="s2">co-op but they would just order food</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.690" style="s2">together and it would come once every</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.890" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">other month I think in a big truck and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.690" end="00:38:16.980" style="s2">we&#39;d all meet at a different person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:20.369" style="s2">house the kids would run around and give</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.980" end="00:38:22.770" style="s2">me some fruit leather and the parents</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.369" end="00:38:25.020" style="s2">would like dole out everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.770" end="00:38:27.090" style="s2">different orders and then we&#39;d have food</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.020" end="00:38:30.840" style="s2">or whatever for a couple months and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.090" end="00:38:34.410" style="s2">we do it again it was really fun it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.840" end="00:38:36.570" style="s2">a good way to do bulk because multiple</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.410" end="00:38:37.830" style="s2">people would order one large amount of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.570" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">something and split it up when they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.830" end="00:38:43.950" style="s2">there and their own packaging it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">pretty old-school but it was a fun thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.950" end="00:38:48.450" style="s2">but I can see having that more modern</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:51.630" style="s2">version of that where you do have both</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.450" end="00:38:53.550" style="s2">that you get at your hub your Commons or</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.630" end="00:38:55.290" style="s2">whatever you have like a bulk section of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.550" end="00:38:57.690" style="s2">whatever it is the neighborhood really</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.290" end="00:39:00.150" style="s2">wants so every neighborhood gets dust</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.690" end="00:39:04.920" style="s2">kind of order what they&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.150" end="00:39:06.210" style="s2">having and also um just on the side now</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.920" end="00:39:08.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen this but</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.210" end="00:39:11.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen on I don&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.490" end="00:39:15.300" style="s2">Science Channel or something anyway that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.160" end="00:39:19.350" style="s2">you can they&#39;re able to make energy like</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.300" end="00:39:22.109" style="s2">a gasoline I think out of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.350" end="00:39:23.790" style="s2">plastics all sorts of garbage have you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.109" end="00:39:25.470" style="s2">seen this where this guy like created</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.790" end="00:39:29.250" style="s2">this huge contraption it&#39;s like on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.470" end="00:39:31.050" style="s2">back of a giant trailer and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.250" end="00:39:33.450" style="s2">three stories tall and he gets in there</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.050" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">he&#39;s just feeding it plastic and garbage</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.450" end="00:39:37.590" style="s2">and stuff and then later he pulls out a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:39.570" style="s2">jug of like gasoline that you could run</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.590" end="00:39:41.880" style="s2">your car on I mean that&#39;s what it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.570" end="00:39:44.340" style="s2">before it was so I guess I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:46.470" style="s2">possible I&#39;m wondering what processes</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.340" end="00:39:50.700" style="s2">how many chemicals how much heat and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.470" end="00:39:52.080" style="s2">on is required but when with that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.700" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">can and do other things like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.080" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">capturing the heat or double it you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:59.370" style="s2">there&#39;s thermal I&#39;m not a science</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:03.150" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.370" end="00:40:05.850" style="s2">where you can maximize that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.150" end="00:40:12.150" style="s2">this was just like you could drive it to</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.850" end="00:40:14.610" style="s2">your neighborhood it&#39;s kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.150" end="00:40:21.300" style="s2">DeLorean on Back to the Future he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.610" end="00:40:22.920" style="s2">feeding it garbage you just need a time</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.300" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">machine we can solve everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.920" end="00:40:28.980" style="s2">gonna be the new section what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:32.130" style="s2">time machine one of the things so like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.980" end="00:40:33.540" style="s2">crowdsource platform to help companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.130" end="00:40:35.010" style="s2">or help individuals like here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.540" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">product how do I get it to you for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.010" end="00:40:38.820" style="s2">least amount right to actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.530" style="s2">consumer be part of it like and when</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.820" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">there&#39;s an inventor an engineer to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.530" end="00:40:43.260" style="s2">actually help them get their idea out</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:45.360" style="s2">into the world right like to actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.260" end="00:40:47.490" style="s2">know can we trust it what is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.360" end="00:40:49.530" style="s2">transparency of it right like what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.490" end="00:40:52.320" style="s2">the water energy and output that comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.530" end="00:40:53.610" style="s2">into it and we working together we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.320" end="00:40:55.710" style="s2">basically do anything like I love the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.610" end="00:40:58.020" style="s2">hub IG I also have a similar idea like</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.710" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">not every hub is gonna need the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.020" end="00:41:03.050" style="s2">things and so there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:06.330" style="s2">of we&#39;re talk about resiliency and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.050" end="00:41:08.190" style="s2">something else I speak fragility and if</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.330" end="00:41:10.020" style="s2">you have like you know you need six</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.190" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">months supply right for your entire</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.020" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">neighborhood so you can have six months</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:14.790" style="s2">of flour and when you&#39;re open that six</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:16.830" style="s2">month of flour you order the new one</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.790" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">right and so you&#39;re constantly turning</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.830" end="00:41:20.340" style="s2">them over for things that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.180" style="s2">that you know you use a lot of but</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.340" end="00:41:22.620" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.180" end="00:41:24.570" style="s2">because you&#39;re getting freshness right</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.620" end="00:41:26.580" style="s2">if our last four six months you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.570" end="00:41:29.030" style="s2">getting freshness and you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.580" end="00:41:31.320" style="s2">like you&#39;re not needing to have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.030" end="00:41:33.120" style="s2">constant stream right like well we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.320" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">we we&#39;re on our last scoop now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.120" end="00:41:37.320" style="s2">order anyone right like you have that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:39.810" style="s2">you have enough storage capacity for six</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.320" end="00:41:41.850" style="s2">months worth of your stuff but not not</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.810" end="00:41:43.500" style="s2">ten years and not two days right you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.850" end="00:41:45.870" style="s2">have six months but you&#39;re also cycling</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.500" end="00:41:47.640" style="s2">through it um could be and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.870" end="00:41:51.750" style="s2">neighborhood could definitely you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.640" end="00:41:53.340" style="s2">have many hubs right this guy&#39;s garages</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.750" end="00:41:54.810" style="s2">flour and this per these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.340" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">carriages rice and this one whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.810" end="00:41:58.440" style="s2">yeah absolutely absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.540" style="s2">distributors pub in the neighborhood I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.440" end="00:42:03.540" style="s2">love it I love it and as shiloh is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.540" end="00:42:06.930" style="s2">saying it builds relationship as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.540" end="00:42:08.580" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s a really beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:10.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a really beautiful thing now how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.580" end="00:42:10.650" style="s2">you get people to start actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.050" end="00:42:13.020" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.650" end="00:42:15.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the which is like that is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.020" end="00:42:16.890" style="s2">conversation right if you had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.210" end="00:42:18.600" style="s2">people together then you just and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.890" end="00:42:19.830" style="s2">is the biggest priority right well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.600" end="00:42:21.210" style="s2">all over the place we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.830" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">come up with a neighborhood hub right</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.210" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">but maybe we&#39;re like actually this is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:26.580" style="s2">important enough thing I need to 500</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:28.290" style="s2">neighbors and you need to find a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.580" end="00:42:30.210" style="s2">neighbors and you do like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.290" end="00:42:31.880" style="s2">kind of micro projects all over the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.210" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.880" end="00:42:41.190" style="s2">10,000 right so you know I I came in</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.230" style="s2">leading the conversation so I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.190" end="00:42:46.320" style="s2">if you&#39;ve already talked about this but</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.230" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">but we talking to be incentive</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.320" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">structures around around this whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:54.690" style="s2">thing because the way I see it now I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:58.770" style="s2">mean you guys were talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.690" end="00:43:01.950" style="s2">know mycelium and and kelp and all these</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.770" end="00:43:03.540" style="s2">various things and to my knowledge we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.950" end="00:43:06.860" style="s2">have the technology to solve these</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.540" end="00:43:15.900" style="s2">problems already why don&#39;t we see it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.860" end="00:43:17.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s the barriers you know where</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.900" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">are the barriers to these things not</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.460" end="00:43:28.770" style="s2">yeah not how do you do it but let it</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:32.490" style="s2">happen I do think that you&#39;re right is</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.770" end="00:43:34.320" style="s2">part the incentive on our end isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.490" end="00:43:36.930" style="s2">there and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.320" end="00:43:38.940" style="s2">Jubilee and I&#39;ve talked about like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.930" end="00:43:40.950" style="s2">value system that actually value on our</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.940" end="00:43:43.560" style="s2">end where the ones are showing our value</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.950" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">by what we&#39;re doing with the recycling</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.560" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">how were collectively ordering stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:53.910" style="s2">reducing and on the other end if we had</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:56.370" style="s2">hubs in this value system we can also be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.910" end="00:44:00.090" style="s2">incentivizing what we&#39;re gonna do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.370" end="00:44:02.340" style="s2">the waste that we can recycle locally</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.090" end="00:44:04.230" style="s2">like into another product right there so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.340" end="00:44:06.030" style="s2">then there&#39;s this like whole loop but</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.230" end="00:44:07.830" style="s2">it&#39;s also being valued so the value</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.030" end="00:44:09.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t just at the top and they decide</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.830" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">but they aren&#39;t going to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.120" end="00:44:15.270" style="s2">waste we deal with it they just give it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">to us instead we&#39;re also where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.270" end="00:44:19.290" style="s2">closed-loop end and we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.940" style="s2">something with it so collectively it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.290" end="00:44:23.090" style="s2">kind of a game in that way because each</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.940" end="00:44:24.180" style="s2">community then has to figure out ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.090" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">collect</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.180" end="00:44:31.140" style="s2">to do something with the recyclable</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:33.180" style="s2">items or bits and hopefully it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.140" end="00:44:34.740" style="s2">something that is another solution to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.180" end="00:44:36.569" style="s2">what they need in their community so</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.740" end="00:44:38.849" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re making certain packaging</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.569" end="00:44:40.680" style="s2">out of the old packaging that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.849" end="00:44:44.730" style="s2">reusing in their community to go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.680" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">their farmers market or I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.730" end="00:44:51.539" style="s2">do think is it not a little bit unfair</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.700" style="s2">and don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.539" end="00:44:55.230" style="s2">I&#39;m not disagreeing with anything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.700" end="00:44:58.710" style="s2">saying Shiro I&#39;m just that is it not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.230" end="00:45:01.349" style="s2">little bit unfair that the manufacturers</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.710" end="00:45:04.170" style="s2">continue to can continue to produce</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.349" end="00:45:06.299" style="s2">packaging which is you know wasteful and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.170" end="00:45:08.250" style="s2">destructive and it&#39;s left up to us as</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.299" end="00:45:10.619" style="s2">the end users to figure out how to close</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.250" end="00:45:12.450" style="s2">the loop right that&#39;s that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.619" end="00:45:14.369" style="s2">reasonable burden to place on us right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.450" end="00:45:15.750" style="s2">and it needs it needs to be organized</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.369" end="00:45:17.910" style="s2">higher up the chain it&#39;s not to say we</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.750" end="00:45:19.170" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do it right anything else of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.910" end="00:45:21.960" style="s2">course we should all do what we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.170" end="00:45:25.470" style="s2">right but it&#39;s not actually fair in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.960" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">long run I completely agree with you and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.470" end="00:45:31.349" style="s2">I think that by having this value system</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:33.630" style="s2">we have more power than to make them</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.349" end="00:45:36.690" style="s2">change their ways because we&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.630" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">that are wanting less ways we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.690" end="00:45:40.680" style="s2">anywhere to take it we can&#39;t do things</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">with it then we have more power because</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.680" end="00:45:48.119" style="s2">we&#39;re collectively realizing it through</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">this these measurements then we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.119" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">enabling them in a way right now yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:45:57.510" style="s2">feel like if we did have the power to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.339" style="s2">as much as we could then we also have</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.510" end="00:46:01.319" style="s2">the power to get them to help on our</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.339" end="00:46:04.920" style="s2">side like how can you make changes so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.319" end="00:46:07.799" style="s2">that we can make and then like we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.920" end="00:46:09.539" style="s2">kind of devalue them if they&#39;re not hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.799" end="00:46:11.190" style="s2">trying to get into that system which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.539" end="00:46:14.190" style="s2">something we could absolutely do with</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.190" end="00:46:15.809" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 is to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.190" end="00:46:16.859" style="s2">like I said with the packaging where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.809" end="00:46:18.779" style="s2">are helping them figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.859" end="00:46:21.240" style="s2">packaging but even more than that if</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.779" end="00:46:24.029" style="s2">you&#39;re the inputs and outputs are</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.240" end="00:46:26.039" style="s2">generally known or we can figure them</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.029" end="00:46:28.020" style="s2">out for any product so knowing what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.039" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">inputted both energy water and materials</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.020" end="00:46:32.609" style="s2">what the things are coming off of it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:34.170" style="s2">what do you produce at the end right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.609" end="00:46:35.819" style="s2">because if we can close the loop if</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.170" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh wait we have I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.819" end="00:46:37.470" style="s2">schools kind of do it right they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:40.470" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.470" end="00:46:42.660" style="s2">oh we have it look left the bread ties</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.470" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">right that you tie and because they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.660" end="00:46:46.050" style="s2">a project to do with them well if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:47.849" style="s2">could close that loop if we were like</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.050" end="00:46:49.590" style="s2">hey this school needs these twist ties</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.849" end="00:46:51.540" style="s2">and this school needs needs toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.590" end="00:46:53.130" style="s2">rolls there are things that are more</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.540" end="00:46:55.410" style="s2">useful as they are before they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.130" end="00:46:56.609" style="s2">recycled I was laughing when you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.410" end="00:46:57.540" style="s2">talking with art because my kid just</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.609" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">came out the other day like where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.540" end="00:47:01.140" style="s2">styrofoam like the neverending source of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:02.940" style="s2">styrofoam left and like oh it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.140" end="00:47:04.349" style="s2">in our in our shed some couldn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.940" end="00:47:06.780" style="s2">to transfer station but I was like I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.349" end="00:47:08.340" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t exist right now I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.780" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">took it in we&#39;re going to need to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.340" end="00:47:14.220" style="s2">new ones and but anyway having that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:17.099" style="s2">can use our intellectual labor right</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.220" end="00:47:18.570" style="s2">like we can map the system where does</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.099" end="00:47:20.970" style="s2">this stuff come from what package means</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.570" end="00:47:22.940" style="s2">and what but also we can help close that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:25.230" style="s2">system of okay well this is a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.940" end="00:47:26.790" style="s2">where does it go right I know shipping</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.230" end="00:47:28.200" style="s2">containers to be made into houses and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.790" end="00:47:29.430" style="s2">now shipping containers more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.200" end="00:47:31.109" style="s2">whom they use because people are looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.430" end="00:47:34.140" style="s2">to make them into houses like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.109" end="00:47:36.420" style="s2">next shipping container what&#39;s the I</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.140" end="00:47:38.760" style="s2">have friends who have a workers</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.420" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">cooperative called the wood shop here in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.760" end="00:47:42.690" style="s2">Vancouver and they use I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:44.099" style="s2">they still use it but the pallets that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.690" end="00:47:46.109" style="s2">everything shipped on there are never</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.099" end="00:47:47.670" style="s2">shipped back so it&#39;s basically only one</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.109" end="00:47:49.830" style="s2">way of shipping and when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.670" end="00:47:51.210" style="s2">treated they use that one because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.830" end="00:47:52.589" style="s2">free wood right and they can make</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.210" end="00:47:54.359" style="s2">beautiful furniture out of it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.589" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">their labors they&#39;re getting something</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.359" end="00:47:57.450" style="s2">but one too many people use it then it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:47:58.859" style="s2">becomes an actual quantity but being</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.450" end="00:48:01.260" style="s2">able to close those loops like I have</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.859" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">this thing who wants to take it from me</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.260" end="00:48:03.570" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.400" style="s2">oil weirdly is in that position where</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.570" end="00:48:07.369" style="s2">it&#39;s at a negative per barrel because</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.400" end="00:48:10.230" style="s2">they just want people to take it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.369" end="00:48:12.089" style="s2">produces it too fast but we have tons of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.230" end="00:48:14.760" style="s2">things like that in our in our actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.089" end="00:48:16.830" style="s2">economy that like it&#39;s the end product</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.760" end="00:48:19.109" style="s2">we don&#39;t like all the Amazon boxes right</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.830" end="00:48:20.369" style="s2">they like just pile up because they</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.109" end="00:48:20.630" style="s2">shipped to you you&#39;re not shipping them</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.369" end="00:48:22.830" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.630" end="00:48:24.900" style="s2">Amazon needs to figure that the out</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.830" end="00:48:26.310" style="s2">right we should be using frog boxes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.900" end="00:48:28.349" style="s2">it should be getting shipped back to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.310" end="00:48:29.700" style="s2">and if we had a hub that you had things</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.349" end="00:48:32.099" style="s2">to go back there be reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.700" end="00:48:33.930" style="s2">collapsible collapsible ships back to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.099" end="00:48:35.460" style="s2">them and then they reuse it but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.930" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">there don&#39;t have the incentive to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.460" end="00:48:39.030" style="s2">that because then that&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.710" style="s2">they have to move it yeah I mean on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.030" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">moment this is exactly what yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.710" end="00:48:43.349" style="s2">this is kind of what Matt was asking</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:44.940" style="s2">about because at the moment these</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.349" end="00:48:47.010" style="s2">sensors are all stacked up on</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.940" end="00:48:48.589" style="s2">externalize as many costs as you can to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.010" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">the Commons right that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.589" end="00:48:55.609" style="s2">where the incentives currently line up</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:57.990" style="s2">and yeah IIIi in a way it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.609" end="00:48:59.160" style="s2">coming up with local solutions to deal</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.990" end="00:49:01.859" style="s2">with the waste which are being produced</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.160" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">at you know these these giant</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.859" end="00:49:10.290" style="s2">manufacturing plants is just increasing</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:11.820" style="s2">their incentive to keep doing it if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.290" end="00:49:13.619" style="s2">see I mean because they&#39;ve externalized</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.820" end="00:49:14.820" style="s2">their cost to us now do you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.619" end="00:49:16.980" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not even to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.820" end="00:49:19.290" style="s2">but we we are now but you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.980" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">stepped in bravely to save the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.290" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">environment but for them</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">brilliant someone else to externalise</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:29.010" style="s2">our costs on to what have we mean them</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:30.390" style="s2">here well that&#39;s I love the notion I</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:32.490" style="s2">don&#39;t know no idea how you go about</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.390" end="00:49:34.890" style="s2">organizing it but I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.490" end="00:49:37.230" style="s2">sending the packaging back to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.890" end="00:49:38.970" style="s2">producers of it right so all those boxes</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.230" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">do go back to Amazon all those little</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.970" end="00:49:42.900" style="s2">plastic yogurt pots go back to moolah</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:44.460" style="s2">you know all of this kind of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.900" end="00:49:46.050" style="s2">then they have to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.460" end="00:49:48.359" style="s2">now how you actually organize that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.050" end="00:49:50.790" style="s2">logistically I have no idea but but that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.359" end="00:49:52.560" style="s2">that sorts it out right because they</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.790" end="00:49:56.690" style="s2">can&#39;t they know it&#39;s piling up in their</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.560" end="00:49:56.690" style="s2">factory yard whatever they call it I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.930" end="00:50:01.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this story that I have my head</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:02.760" style="s2">since I was a teenager that I heard so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.230" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s actually true but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.760" end="00:50:06.839" style="s2">don&#39;t care if it&#39;s true because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:09.060" style="s2">awesome that there&#39;s a European country</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.839" end="00:50:11.220" style="s2">where when they went to the store and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.060" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">there was all of that packaging they had</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.220" end="00:50:14.820" style="s2">a protest what they did is as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:16.890" style="s2">they walked out to their cars it took</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.820" end="00:50:19.260" style="s2">off every bit of non-essential packaging</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.890" end="00:50:21.210" style="s2">and threw it on the ground and I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.260" end="00:50:23.220" style="s2">like if littering is ever a protest</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.210" end="00:50:25.650" style="s2">because then that&#39;s the store was like</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.220" end="00:50:27.660" style="s2">well we are not cleaning this up so they</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.650" end="00:50:30.570" style="s2">made it so that there couldn&#39;t be accept</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.660" end="00:50:31.859" style="s2">excess packaging and then no one had</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.570" end="00:50:33.390" style="s2">excess packaging right you bought your</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.859" end="00:50:35.790" style="s2">toothpaste in a tube you didn&#39;t buy it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.390" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">with the box on it and and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.790" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">truthfully you would know what because</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">then then if you&#39;re getting it all</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">squished up and you&#39;re like wait no we</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">actually need that box back that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:45.089" style="s2">actually not access or how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">actually solve this problem like there</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.089" end="00:50:48.089" style="s2">are ways we can come together I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:50.490" style="s2">always wanted to have that protest it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.089" end="00:50:52.890" style="s2">sounds to danger of like just shutting</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.490" end="00:50:54.869" style="s2">off the gravity soon as you get get out</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.890" end="00:50:59.190" style="s2">of the supermarket like it was just so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.869" end="00:51:01.290" style="s2">brilliant yes restaurants where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.190" end="00:51:02.430" style="s2">you know we throw the peak mats on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.290" end="00:51:03.780" style="s2">ground you know those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.430" end="00:51:08.200" style="s2">restaurants yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.780" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like Ryan&#39;s me of that yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.200" end="00:51:12.220" style="s2">protest it was like yes and it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like Sweden or Switzerland or one</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.220" end="00:51:15.910" style="s2">of those countries that supposedly did</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:17.890" style="s2">it of course but I mean like I said this</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.910" end="00:51:20.740" style="s2">was pre-internet so I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.890" end="00:51:26.500" style="s2">would be on that there is the best place</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.740" end="00:51:28.390" style="s2">in like the early 90s late 80s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.500" end="00:51:31.540" style="s2">forced a reexamination of behavior right</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:32.170" style="s2">the shot actually changed there so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.540" end="00:51:34.030" style="s2">no it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.170" end="00:51:35.530" style="s2">that&#39;s great I love that like every</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.030" end="00:51:37.270" style="s2">country has their own rules and</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.530" end="00:51:38.859" style="s2">regulations right like here in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.270" end="00:51:41.140" style="s2">you can&#39;t sell something less than us</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.859" end="00:51:42.550" style="s2">French and English on it so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.140" end="00:51:46.270" style="s2">sell something in Canada if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.550" end="00:51:48.460" style="s2">put French on it like other countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.270" end="00:51:49.869" style="s2">have packaging requirements or that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.460" end="00:51:51.490" style="s2">can&#39;t have this type of plastic because</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.869" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous for the environment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.490" end="00:51:54.609" style="s2">like well why do different countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:56.290" style="s2">have these different rules and why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.609" end="00:51:57.490" style="s2">we all adopt the best rule it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.290" end="00:52:01.089" style="s2">everyone needs not French in English</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.490" end="00:52:02.680" style="s2">clearly but like how do we get the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.089" end="00:52:04.900" style="s2">minimal amount of packaging why are</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.680" end="00:52:07.030" style="s2">things out lot in Europe but okay in</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.900" end="00:52:08.349" style="s2">America what is the reason you&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.030" end="00:52:10.089" style="s2">a lot it right what is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.349" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">America allows it like getting that just</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.089" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">that information a source of information</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:15.670" style="s2">that you can trust it&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:18.760" style="s2">we could do and send out some people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.670" end="00:52:20.260" style="s2">how does the dollars the different</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.760" end="00:52:23.950" style="s2">regulations in different countries and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.260" end="00:52:26.140" style="s2">why I do love the I still want to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.950" end="00:52:31.000" style="s2">back to the hem because hemp is such a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.140" end="00:52:33.309" style="s2">great environmental product or I want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.000" end="00:52:35.799" style="s2">call it a product plant the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.309" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">you know right now and I might have</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.799" end="00:52:38.799" style="s2">mentioned this to this group I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:41.530" style="s2">remember but I know that there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.799" end="00:52:47.020" style="s2">some people I&#39;ve interacted with on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.530" end="00:52:49.960" style="s2">solution Club a radish they are very</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.020" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">actively trying to get people who have</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.960" end="00:52:56.440" style="s2">land to grow hemp on their land for them</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:58.630" style="s2">and they get carbon credits so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.440" end="00:53:00.849" style="s2">of a money-making thing just to grow</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.630" end="00:53:03.130" style="s2">hemp on your land but then they the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.849" end="00:53:05.470" style="s2">people that are in charge of this then</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.130" end="00:53:08.470" style="s2">they get to make CBD oil out of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.470" end="00:53:11.319" style="s2">they&#39;re making hempcrete out of it there</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.470" end="00:53:15.099" style="s2">re they&#39;re using the product then as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.319" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2">green product for building or packaging</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.099" end="00:53:19.539" style="s2">they could do the Hansel</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:22.180" style="s2">plus they are getting money for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.539" end="00:53:23.950" style="s2">carbon capturing that the plants</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.180" end="00:53:26.410" style="s2">themselves do plus like you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.950" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">and also those plants pull pollutants</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.410" end="00:53:31.539" style="s2">out of the ground just so many ways that</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:35.859" style="s2">that&#39;s working you could easily have</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.539" end="00:53:39.190" style="s2">people there manufacturer like packaging</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.859" end="00:53:43.420" style="s2">for the fruit very easily we&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.190" end="00:53:45.069" style="s2">like the idea of the kelp and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.420" end="00:53:47.079" style="s2">like we need a lot of help in our oceans</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.069" end="00:53:49.809" style="s2">we have such acidification and kelp is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.079" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">the only thing that we know of that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.809" end="00:53:54.309" style="s2">counteract that so I&#39;d like to see more</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:56.589" style="s2">kelp growing in the ocean and just</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.309" end="00:53:57.940" style="s2">stayin in the ocean instead of using it</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.589" end="00:53:59.710" style="s2">up like it becomes a really popular</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.940" end="00:54:02.710" style="s2">product and then they&#39;re out there</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.710" end="00:54:04.210" style="s2">farming it like crazy how great it could</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.710" end="00:54:05.410" style="s2">be said that you grow in bats though</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.210" end="00:54:07.180" style="s2">right that doesn&#39;t need to be from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.410" end="00:54:09.069" style="s2">ocean but yeah taking stuff from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.180" end="00:54:10.900" style="s2">ocean and not remember like fish fish is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.069" end="00:54:12.789" style="s2">great let&#39;s just eat all the fish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.900" end="00:54:17.140" style="s2">not a great a great solution even if</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.789" end="00:54:19.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s there but was a I think you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.140" end="00:54:21.999" style="s2">could even reuse a lot of like some hemp</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.930" end="00:54:23.349" style="s2">you can make that&#39;s nearly disposable</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.999" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">but you could be we&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.349" end="00:54:29.589" style="s2">crocheting your own hemp bags for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">grocery or whatnot wash and reuse them</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.589" end="00:54:34.509" style="s2">just like that&#39;s for transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">data and information come in cuz I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.509" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if hemp falls in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:41.319" style="s2">category might imagine it does that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">with peanuts and pistachios where it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.319" end="00:54:46.329" style="s2">a plant you grow in crap soil so that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:48.099" style="s2">sucks out all of the contaminants but</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.329" end="00:54:50.200" style="s2">because the incentive is I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.099" end="00:54:52.239" style="s2">grow peanuts and pistachios and hemp and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.200" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">not sell it I clearly need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.239" end="00:54:57.369" style="s2">make money they sell it to us and so our</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:55:00.489" style="s2">peanuts have crap in them because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.369" end="00:55:02.319" style="s2">sucked it all out of the soil and so if</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.489" end="00:55:04.059" style="s2">you are making profit because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.319" end="00:55:07.749" style="s2">taking hemp and sucking out and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.059" end="00:55:09.039" style="s2">making CBD oil if we it&#39;s our company</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.749" end="00:55:11.079" style="s2">and we have access to that information</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.039" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">we&#39;re like no we processed it more look</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.079" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the contaminants in it</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.809" style="s2">but we can fully see that what did we do</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:18.849" style="s2">with the contaminants that when you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.809" end="00:55:21.190" style="s2">this profit incentive it means that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.849" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">you&#39;re incentivized to hide things right</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.190" end="00:55:24.819" style="s2">to say oh you get to know that hemp it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:26.259" style="s2">good for the environment you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.819" end="00:55:27.519" style="s2">to know all the that we do to it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.259" end="00:55:29.740" style="s2">make it that way right like when I see</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.519" end="00:55:32.080" style="s2">him clothing I&#39;m like well what had</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.740" end="00:55:34.060" style="s2">you&#39;ll be done to make it into is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.080" end="00:55:36.190" style="s2">the state like hemp hard plastic like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.060" end="00:55:38.320" style="s2">what is the actual process the more we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.190" end="00:55:39.670" style="s2">can transparently know that than the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.320" end="00:55:41.230" style="s2">more we can trust it the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.670" end="00:55:43.240" style="s2">come up with actual solutions otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.230" end="00:55:44.560" style="s2">you crank the solution and you pass off</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.240" end="00:55:45.910" style="s2">only the positive and not the negative</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.560" end="00:55:48.210" style="s2">instead of dealing with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.910" end="00:55:51.070" style="s2">picture that we can deal with together I</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.210" end="00:55:52.810" style="s2">think that that whole that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.070" end="00:55:55.540" style="s2">mapping system that we have to create</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.810" end="00:55:58.150" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s like main part</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.540" end="00:56:00.700" style="s2">of game B or whatever is gonna be this</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.150" end="00:56:02.320" style="s2">mapping system that shows how</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.700" end="00:56:04.420" style="s2">interconnected all these things are how</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.320" end="00:56:06.490" style="s2">the processes are what the waste of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.420" end="00:56:08.920" style="s2">those processes are I totally agree and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.490" end="00:56:11.740" style="s2">you could have food-grade him</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.920" end="00:56:13.360" style="s2">you could have pollutant grade hemp that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.740" end="00:56:15.190" style="s2">you&#39;re using specifically flat and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.360" end="00:56:16.780" style="s2">put it in your cut your concrete or your</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.190" end="00:56:20.170" style="s2">hempcrete that you make buildings out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.780" end="00:56:21.820" style="s2">and it just stays there and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.170" end="00:56:23.800" style="s2">that there&#39;s a place for everything but</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.820" end="00:56:25.360" style="s2">when you win it&#39;s your profit on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.800" end="00:56:27.910" style="s2">line you&#39;re gonna hide things like</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.360" end="00:56:29.230" style="s2">there&#39;s reasons there salts and every</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.910" end="00:56:30.430" style="s2">one of our products was it taste good</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.230" end="00:56:32.200" style="s2">right there&#39;s reasons there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.430" end="00:56:34.270" style="s2">preservatives because it&#39;s profitable if</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.200" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">we are making those decisions together</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.270" end="00:56:39.670" style="s2">we can we can have an informed decision</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:41.770" style="s2">and in a trade off right who I want no</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.670" end="00:56:44.050" style="s2">salt and then I want to add my own soul</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.770" end="00:56:45.340" style="s2">because I can&#39;t take it out versus oh no</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.050" end="00:56:46.510" style="s2">it just tastes good</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.340" end="00:56:48.970" style="s2">well that&#39;s why they&#39;re putting it in</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.510" end="00:56:52.450" style="s2">there to stop tricking your taste buds</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.970" end="00:56:54.730" style="s2">just add more flavor add more something</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.450" end="00:56:56.560" style="s2">that has nutrients on you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.730" end="00:56:58.420" style="s2">more of but the more that we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.560" end="00:57:01.480" style="s2">the process and it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.420" end="00:57:03.310" style="s2">transparent then we can make the choices</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.480" end="00:57:04.780" style="s2">together for those things right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.310" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">gonna have preservatives and things I</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.780" end="00:57:08.230" style="s2">want a shelf-life on a lot of things I</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">want to be able to stock up on on tomato</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.230" end="00:57:12.310" style="s2">sauce for six months but not if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:14.410" style="s2">causing cancer right so like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.310" end="00:57:16.990" style="s2">impact of this ingredient and is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.410" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">worth it it&#39;s always worth it for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.990" end="00:57:20.170" style="s2">for-profit company they&#39;re passing it</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:21.609" style="s2">off they don&#39;t care right is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.170" end="00:57:23.290" style="s2">profitable and they&#39;re ignorant Lee</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.609" end="00:57:26.760" style="s2">truly their heads in the sand they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.290" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">know it causes cancer sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.760" end="00:57:31.150" style="s2">sometimes yeah no no but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.710" style="s2">like it&#39;s not just evil doing evil for</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.150" end="00:57:34.810" style="s2">evils sake it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.710" end="00:57:36.280" style="s2">even no I couldn&#39;t possibly we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.810" end="00:57:38.350" style="s2">eating it for years it couldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.280" end="00:57:39.850" style="s2">because it&#39;s making them profit and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.350" end="00:57:43.570" style="s2">a lot easier to remain in the dark when</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.850" end="00:57:46.750" style="s2">your money is in the dark one one thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.570" end="00:57:51.610" style="s2">I wear wear my biggest issue with this</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.750" end="00:57:55.540" style="s2">is is if you look as this whole thing as</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.610" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2">a loop or a stack the the part that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.540" end="00:58:00.010" style="s2">really don&#39;t like is okay let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.450" end="00:58:03.510" style="s2">make it out of them let&#39;s say we make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.010" end="00:58:06.840" style="s2">out of some great perfect material I</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.510" end="00:58:09.550" style="s2">don&#39;t like throwing it in a trash can</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.840" end="00:58:11.890" style="s2">putting my trash can on the street</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.550" end="00:58:14.440" style="s2">waiting for this big dump truck to come</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.890" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">around once a week take it to a landfill</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.440" end="00:58:21.670" style="s2">and then ship it to China China dumps it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:23.620" style="s2">off on you know pirates or whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.670" end="00:58:26.860" style="s2">dump it off the coast of Africa which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.620" end="00:58:31.270" style="s2">hear but that&#39;s that&#39;s what I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.860" end="00:58:34.120" style="s2">I would like a solution where it ends</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.270" end="00:58:37.120" style="s2">with me you know where I don&#39;t where I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.120" end="00:58:38.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have to externalize the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.120" end="00:58:42.130" style="s2">responsibility to all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.980" end="00:58:43.900" style="s2">systems to take care of my garbage or my</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.130" end="00:58:45.460" style="s2">trash because I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.900" end="00:58:47.980" style="s2">gonna do the right thing with it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.460" end="00:58:50.200" style="s2">know and even if I know that okay now</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.980" end="00:58:54.580" style="s2">all of a sudden my garbage and trash is</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.200" end="00:58:56.140" style="s2">clean you know you&#39;re still putting it</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.580" end="00:58:58.510" style="s2">out there and and and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.140" end="00:59:00.130" style="s2">mystery so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.510" end="00:59:02.170" style="s2">relates to what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.130" end="00:59:02.980" style="s2">but but but that&#39;s just kind of how I</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.170" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">see things</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.980" end="00:59:08.740" style="s2">it absolutely relates producing waste</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:11.380" style="s2">that is actually not waste right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.740" end="00:59:14.170" style="s2">about producing waste which can be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.380" end="00:59:16.300" style="s2">input for some other system yeah so is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.170" end="00:59:17.860" style="s2">it you can&#39;t eliminate waste I mean all</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.300" end="00:59:20.980" style="s2">systems produce waste through this but</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.860" end="00:59:23.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s waste that can be processed by</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.980" end="00:59:25.470" style="s2">the external environment in inner inner</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.080" end="00:59:29.080" style="s2">in a positive way right that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.470" end="00:59:31.000" style="s2">processed harmoniously so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.080" end="00:59:33.580" style="s2">that that&#39;s the goal I think rather than</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.000" end="00:59:35.500" style="s2">it and so if you if you were able to and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.580" end="00:59:37.270" style="s2">listen hemp is not the answer to all</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.500" end="00:59:39.730" style="s2">problems right but I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.270" end="00:59:41.640" style="s2">certainly a component in in certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.730" end="00:59:43.990" style="s2">domains it certainly has a role to play</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.640" end="00:59:46.660" style="s2">but you know if you are throwing away</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.990" end="00:59:49.000" style="s2">you know for example icon pops right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.660" end="00:59:52.150" style="s2">I can&#39;t throw any plastic on my compost</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.000" end="00:59:53.860" style="s2">now but if the thin plastic was made out</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.860" end="00:59:56.940" style="s2">that it will compost right and I could</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.840" end="00:59:58.800" style="s2">throw all the compost</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.940" end="01:00:00.150" style="s2">a three-month slide it gets dug into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.800" end="01:00:01.980" style="s2">soil and its nutrients for the plot you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.150" end="01:00:04.050" style="s2">know what I mean and that&#39;s it Luke</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.980" end="01:00:07.109" style="s2">closes now back to nature again you said</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.050" end="01:00:09.750" style="s2">I mean and I trust nature to close her</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.109" end="01:00:14.339" style="s2">loops right and so we need to extract in</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.750" end="01:00:16.770" style="s2">a way that is that is taking what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.339" end="01:00:19.230" style="s2">waste for nature if you see what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.770" end="01:00:21.960" style="s2">in some way and then reinsert it back</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.230" end="01:00:24.869" style="s2">into nature in such a way that its food</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.960" end="01:00:28.650" style="s2">poor some way it Venegas or elemina and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.869" end="01:00:30.630" style="s2">and and dusty close our loops I saw in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.650" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">Alan Watts video recently I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.630" end="01:00:34.170" style="s2">quote a couple of little lines from it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:39.780" style="s2">because I think it captures this so nice</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.170" end="01:00:42.510" style="s2">I&#39;m baiting but the the key is to let</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.780" end="01:00:45.390" style="s2">nature dictate the course of nature and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.510" end="01:00:47.460" style="s2">not us try to dictate the course of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.390" end="01:00:49.170" style="s2">nature and then he goes on to say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.460" end="01:00:54.210" style="s2">trying to straighten out a wiggly world</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.170" end="01:00:56.369" style="s2">no wonder you&#39;ve got problems we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.210" end="01:00:58.140" style="s2">the our mark so it&#39;s time to wrap it up</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.369" end="01:01:00.180" style="s2">if anyone has any closing statements and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.140" end="01:01:02.369" style="s2">I keep forgetting to do it but the point</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.180" end="01:01:04.050" style="s2">of like closing it is also to say if</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.369" end="01:01:06.900" style="s2">you&#39;re invited to say what you think is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.050" end="01:01:08.670" style="s2">the best solution that we came up with</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.900" end="01:01:10.710" style="s2">like that you would most want to put</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.670" end="01:01:11.940" style="s2">your time and energy towards again they</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.710" end="01:01:13.710" style="s2">don&#39;t need to match right because the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.940" end="01:01:14.819" style="s2">idea is if you have ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.710" end="01:01:16.920" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be doing all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.819" end="01:01:19.020" style="s2">but what do you think is the most</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.920" end="01:01:22.290" style="s2">powerful thing that you see us doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.020" end="01:01:23.730" style="s2">with 10,000 people and $100,000 either</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.290" end="01:01:27.930" style="s2">that we talked about or brand-new thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.730" end="01:01:30.210" style="s2">it start a whole new I could start I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.930" end="01:01:32.430" style="s2">gonna have to say I think that we need</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.210" end="01:01:34.109" style="s2">to make all of this conscious didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.430" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">like people thinking about where these</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.109" end="01:01:39.960" style="s2">hidden things are so I do think that a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">value system and I&#39;m not saying value</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.960" end="01:01:44.700" style="s2">guys and money but I am saying a</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:49.710" style="s2">measurement system metrics of some sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.700" end="01:01:52.650" style="s2">is a way to teach people how to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.710" end="01:01:55.470" style="s2">conscious of these connections there or</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.650" end="01:01:57.690" style="s2">like names I clean almost everything or</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.470" end="01:01:59.460" style="s2">trying to I see what my things are and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.690" end="01:02:02.099" style="s2">then I&#39;m like okay now I have a huge bag</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.460" end="01:02:03.780" style="s2">of all of these items what can I do with</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.099" end="01:02:05.819" style="s2">them and it is an art project proudly</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.780" end="01:02:08.430" style="s2">but as a community or group or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.819" end="01:02:10.200" style="s2">we could consciously see oh this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.430" end="01:02:10.680" style="s2">we have a lot of waste of what our</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.200" end="01:02:13.050" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.680" end="01:02:16.590" style="s2">how could we put these into solutions so</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.050" end="01:02:24.810" style="s2">I think that mapping is a way to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.590" end="01:02:30.390" style="s2">that consciousness I have to agree with</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.810" end="01:02:33.510" style="s2">Shiloh I I think mapping is is is key to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.390" end="01:02:35.820" style="s2">this and I think people people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.510" end="01:02:38.610" style="s2">have a map to work with currently or</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.820" end="01:02:42.540" style="s2">maybe they do but it&#39;s skewed or altered</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.610" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">in some way so creating an awareness</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.540" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">around that as this is crucial yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:52.020" style="s2">absolutely echo that and education it</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:53.670" style="s2">comes back to education doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.020" end="01:02:56.970" style="s2">because we&#39;re not trained to map these</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.670" end="01:02:59.970" style="s2">things in a you know open an honest way</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.970" end="01:03:02.100" style="s2">where it&#39;s always biased the the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.970" end="01:03:05.910" style="s2">training ecology the information ecology</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.100" end="01:03:07.620" style="s2">it&#39;s all corrupted so yeah it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.910" end="01:03:10.890" style="s2">right but it&#39;s a very difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.620" end="01:03:13.050" style="s2">accomplish and yeah that&#39;s I agree that</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.890" end="01:03:14.610" style="s2">a mapping system is some one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.050" end="01:03:16.830" style="s2">powerful things we could do and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.610" end="01:03:19.140" style="s2">that the more were able to do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.830" end="01:03:20.820" style="s2">internally that is just for the with ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.140" end="01:03:23.100" style="s2">thousand people we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.820" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">convince 7.5 billion to use it we only</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.100" end="01:03:26.790" style="s2">need to create something that like we</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:28.170" style="s2">would use and then invite people to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.790" end="01:03:29.850" style="s2">if it&#39;s something that ten thousand of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.170" end="01:03:30.990" style="s2">us would trust and use then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.850" end="01:03:33.120" style="s2">something that the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.990" end="01:03:34.230" style="s2">have used as well and so starting with</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.120" end="01:03:35.580" style="s2">like what would be the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.230" end="01:03:37.380" style="s2">thing and right now under cope in</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.580" end="01:03:39.600" style="s2">nineteen everyone&#39;s focused on like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.380" end="01:03:41.070" style="s2">vaccine and the treatments but actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.600" end="01:03:42.360" style="s2">mapping our supply chain is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.070" end="01:03:44.220" style="s2">most powerful things we could be doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.360" end="01:03:46.110" style="s2">right now so we have all of this time in</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.220" end="01:03:47.940" style="s2">all of and like everything breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.110" end="01:03:50.190" style="s2">to chemistry like everything breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.940" end="01:03:52.170" style="s2">to there to the ingredients and so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.190" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">goes in what comes out and to the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.170" end="01:03:55.620" style="s2">of our knowledge we could be mapping and</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:59.340" style="s2">it could be something we did with 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.620" end="01:04:01.950" style="s2">people and $100,000 well easily more</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.340" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">easily than than what like hoping this</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.950" end="01:04:08.730" style="s2">works out hoping we somehow turn this</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:10.800" style="s2">pile of garbage into like paradise and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.730" end="01:04:13.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to happen let&#39;s be like</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.800" end="01:04:15.210" style="s2">actually put energy and equipment in so</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.470" end="01:04:19.640" style="s2">we can say goodbye to YouTube and a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.210" end="01:04:19.640" style="s2">periscope and I will see you tomorrow</p>
