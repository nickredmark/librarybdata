<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">podcast we are here to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:43.620" style="s2">is taking place with you with Google</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">with the recent revelations out of</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">do you want to say something about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">you&#39;ve been up to and what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">experienced recently at the the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">Google well let&#39;s back up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been working on the story about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">evergreen which includes you but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">gone beyond the Bret Weinstein story</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">into various layers of student activism</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">and student counter activism and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">the administration and the faculty and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve been following this for now two</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">years and I&#39;ve kind of it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">obvious to me that I might be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">annoying for certain people within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">institution of the Evergreen State</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">College because I keep on bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">light things that they very explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be brought to light</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">however they are a public institution</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">and Washington state law has a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">explicit public records set of statutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">so they owe me information they owe the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">public information and I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">get information even though they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">basically obstructing my access through</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">official means the public records</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">Department is basically locked at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">standstill so I get information from</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">other places well wait I want to stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">you right there because I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">an incredibly important fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">public doesn&#39;t know which is that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:13.130" style="s2">public institution is by all evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.950" style="s2">conspiring again</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.130" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">the laws of the state of Washington it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.950" end="00:02:19.490" style="s2">is obstructing your attempt to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:21.950" style="s2">information that you are legally</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.490" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">entitled to get from the institution and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.950" end="00:02:26.450" style="s2">it&#39;s giving you the runaround so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">raises serious questions about an</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">institution that has problems that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:33.620" style="s2">been revealed through public records</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:36.500" style="s2">requests so effectively the institution</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:38.900" style="s2">has gone rogue and surely there is some</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:41.030" style="s2">legal mechanism that should kick in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.900" end="00:02:43.400" style="s2">forces them to comply because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.030" end="00:02:46.190" style="s2">mechanism that keeps them honest is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.400" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">people like you or me taking information</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.190" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">that we are able to extract and exposing</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:52.940" style="s2">it and discussing it and letting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">chips fall where they may</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:58.120" style="s2">mmm-hm will add to that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:01.010" style="s2">evergreens enrollment is tanking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.120" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">their main source of revenue right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.010" end="00:03:07.240" style="s2">is the legislature and the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:10.130" style="s2">that they can legislate sure legislature</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.240" end="00:03:12.320" style="s2">legislature yeah it is a governing body</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.130" end="00:03:16.010" style="s2">the governing body full of legislatures</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.320" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">yes yes they have the one proud thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.010" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">that evergreen can&#39;t out as a when is</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">getting securing funding from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:27.160" style="s2">legislature they are getting state money</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:30.680" style="s2">in order to survive</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.160" end="00:03:32.630" style="s2">therefore it compounds that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.680" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">problematics of why would they not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.630" end="00:03:35.690" style="s2">following the letter of the state law or</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">even the spirit of the law why would</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.690" end="00:03:39.710" style="s2">they be wanting to take money but not</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:41.570" style="s2">giving anything back in return it seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.710" end="00:03:43.790" style="s2">like a quid pro quo if you are a public</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.570" end="00:03:45.860" style="s2">servant then you are beholden to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.790" end="00:03:49.610" style="s2">public yeah and the law is the law and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.860" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">the Legislature should surely be holding</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.610" end="00:03:55.430" style="s2">them to the laws of the state of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:58.520" style="s2">Washington and presumably withholding</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.430" end="00:04:02.690" style="s2">funds if they don&#39;t comply I would also</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.520" end="00:04:04.310" style="s2">say that the instruction not to comply</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.690" end="00:04:06.800" style="s2">must have come from somewhere and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.310" end="00:04:07.850" style="s2">think you and I would be likely to guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.800" end="00:04:11.030" style="s2">the same source</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.850" end="00:04:12.740" style="s2">yeah George has been all about spin and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.030" end="00:04:16.100" style="s2">president bridges yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.740" end="00:04:18.709" style="s2">yes George bridges and current president</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.100" end="00:04:21.260" style="s2">current president bridges oddly not</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.709" end="00:04:23.570" style="s2">fired after one of the most amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.260" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">shows of incompetence anyone has ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.570" end="00:04:26.970" style="s2">seen on</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">in college well at least live-streamed</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.970" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s for sure but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">say we don&#39;t have evidence for greater</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">incompetence shown by other college</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">presidents that I&#39;m aware of this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:42.750" style="s2">really singular and yet the man retains</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:45.450" style="s2">his job so what brings it up to an</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.750" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">intersection my work on evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.450" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">intersecting with this project ferret s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">revelation about the way that Google is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve already known that Google has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:57.570" style="s2">hand at controlling information that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">should be pretty much obvious but this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.570" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">makes it very explicit a couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:06.780" style="s2">ago I got demonetised no last Tuesday I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">got to monetize about 40 videos in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:11.370" style="s2">last six months were all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">well at the monitors I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.370" end="00:05:14.730" style="s2">quibble here but I think we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:16.979" style="s2">super careful you were soft</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.730" end="00:05:18.750" style="s2">Deanna ties softly which I wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.979" end="00:05:21.870" style="s2">aware was a thing but apparently a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.750" end="00:05:23.669" style="s2">monetized video can exist at different</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.870" end="00:05:25.860" style="s2">levels of monetization and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.669" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">your videos suddenly dropped from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.860" end="00:05:30.750" style="s2">green state to the yellow state yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">thanks for caring and you have inquired</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.750" end="00:05:34.979" style="s2">from yeah I inquired into it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">told that I need to have all those</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.979" end="00:05:39.540" style="s2">videos manually reviewed and I&#39;ve since</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">submitted all those videos to manual</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.540" end="00:05:44.870" style="s2">review and most of them are getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">flipped back into the green but more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.870" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">interesting to me this caused me to look</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:52.169" style="s2">at the Google search and I just typed in</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.680" end="00:06:02.250" style="s2">different result so it might be because</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.250" end="00:06:06.180" style="s2">they&#39;re straining it for some reason but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.810" end="00:06:08.190" style="s2">my videos of which I have ninety two</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.180" end="00:06:11.729" style="s2">about the Evergreen State College and</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.979" end="00:06:39.650" style="s2">about evergreen I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.740" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">the main basis and I am no longer listed</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.650" end="00:06:44.450" style="s2">in the video tab on Google search</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:47.030" style="s2">results you have become hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.450" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">yeah in fact if you use Google to search</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:51.730" style="s2">for you which I find amazing on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:55.880" style="s2">other hand there&#39;s something I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.730" end="00:06:57.710" style="s2">I would say you&#39;re working too hard what</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.880" end="00:07:00.710" style="s2">you&#39;re saying about the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.710" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">finding you is very disturbing but in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.710" end="00:07:04.940" style="s2">light of what&#39;s come out of Project</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.960" style="s2">Veritas in the last couple days I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.940" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.960" end="00:07:13.100" style="s2">interpretation which is that machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:15.110" style="s2">learning is being employed by Google in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.100" end="00:07:18.500" style="s2">order to create what they are calling</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.110" end="00:07:20.900" style="s2">fairness which is much like equity is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.500" end="00:07:23.570" style="s2">the inverse of what we would normally</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.900" end="00:07:25.670" style="s2">assume that term means fairness is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.570" end="00:07:28.190" style="s2">inverse of what we would normally assume</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.670" end="00:07:31.990" style="s2">that term means when deployed by Google</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.190" end="00:07:35.420" style="s2">but the idea that a bunch of your videos</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:38.390" style="s2">suddenly got shifted and then manual</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.420" end="00:07:40.370" style="s2">review is restoring them opens the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.390" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">possibility that what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.370" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">the machine learning algorithm whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:46.910" style="s2">it was sent to look at your stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:49.340" style="s2">whether it finally got around to it or</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.910" end="00:07:52.430" style="s2">whether somebody changed a parameter and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:56.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what caused your videos to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.430" end="00:07:58.670" style="s2">altered in in their state somehow some</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.270" end="00:08:00.950" style="s2">thing inside Google did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.670" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2">thinking for the public and decided that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.950" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">your stuff which is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.110" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">clearly to many who are paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:11.630" style="s2">to the story should disappear and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">idea that that can happen ought to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.630" end="00:08:16.280" style="s2">frighten us because as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:18.670" style="s2">what you do is really just expose the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.280" end="00:08:21.710" style="s2">facts of the situation you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.670" end="00:08:23.750" style="s2">hostile to Evergreen I know from many</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.710" end="00:08:26.480" style="s2">conversations with you some of them on</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.750" end="00:08:29.870" style="s2">camera and some of them not that you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.480" end="00:08:33.410" style="s2">I and Heather all share a desire to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.870" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">the institution write itself and restore</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.410" end="00:08:39.470" style="s2">the model that we know can be so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:42.710" style="s2">successful at educating students so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.470" end="00:08:44.420" style="s2">fact is the public has every reason to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.710" end="00:08:45.710" style="s2">want to look at your content because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.420" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">critique that you&#39;re leveling at this</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.710" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">institution is actually in the hope of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:51.730" style="s2">making the institution</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.139" style="s2">we&#39;re storing it to its former glory</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.730" end="00:08:56.929" style="s2">making it better in the future serving</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.139" end="00:08:59.660" style="s2">students and the idea that some</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.929" end="00:09:01.730" style="s2">algorithm might think that it knows best</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.660" end="00:09:03.829" style="s2">what people should hear about evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.730" end="00:09:06.319" style="s2">and that somehow you&#39;re off-limits based</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.829" end="00:09:08.929" style="s2">on I don&#39;t know what project Veritas</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.319" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">suggested was that they&#39;re using some</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.929" end="00:09:14.839" style="s2">kind of analysis of language algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:18.079" style="s2">that searches for terms and decides what</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.839" end="00:09:19.459" style="s2">might be conservative of all things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.079" end="00:09:22.069" style="s2">just it&#39;s out of control</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.459" end="00:09:23.959" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know if this is more or</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.069" end="00:09:26.929" style="s2">less disturbing but could it also be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.959" end="00:09:28.550" style="s2">case that some third party that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.929" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">hired by Evergreen to boost their</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.550" end="00:09:33.410" style="s2">reputation on the web used a trick to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:36.439" style="s2">get me listed somehow as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.410" end="00:09:39.050" style="s2">untrustworthy news source so Google then</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.439" end="00:09:41.929" style="s2">automatically scrubbed me because I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.050" end="00:09:43.639" style="s2">told somehow I was flagged somehow well</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.929" end="00:09:46.459" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s try that a different way</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.639" end="00:09:48.589" style="s2">let&#39;s say to the extent that there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.459" end="00:09:51.110" style="s2">some algorithm out there making</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:53.480" style="s2">decisions that have big consequences not</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.110" end="00:09:54.740" style="s2">only for your ability to earn but for</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.480" end="00:09:57.379" style="s2">the ability of the public to find</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:09:59.509" style="s2">information that that algorithm the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.379" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">existence of it creates an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.509" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">for agents on the other side to game it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:06.829" style="s2">so if there is an algorithm then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">a question of well what do I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.829" end="00:10:15.139" style="s2">to trigger that algorithm to make my</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:19.009" style="s2">detractors content obscure and some time</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.139" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">ago I tweeted the question I can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.009" end="00:10:22.040" style="s2">it on Twitter I don&#39;t member exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:25.759" style="s2">what phraseology I use but the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.040" end="00:10:30.290" style="s2">was approximately if it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.759" end="00:10:32.389" style="s2">pay Twitter or some other platform to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.290" end="00:10:35.420" style="s2">promote your content what is to stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.389" end="00:10:37.189" style="s2">those platforms from selling the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.420" end="00:10:40.549" style="s2">to down-regulate</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.189" end="00:10:42.860" style="s2">your your competitors content or your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.549" end="00:10:45.649" style="s2">detractors content and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.860" end="00:10:48.290" style="s2">where we are well we are there and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.649" end="00:10:49.639" style="s2">just watched the project very test video</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.290" end="00:10:50.509" style="s2">and one of the questions I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.639" end="00:10:53.689" style="s2">you about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.509" end="00:10:56.839" style="s2">is that if you if any one of us has</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.689" end="00:10:58.429" style="s2">given the power to shape the world such</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.839" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">as Google has the power to shape the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.429" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">world to quote Tim Poole would it not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:05.740" style="s2">a sin to not try to shape the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">the better is this not something that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.740" end="00:11:09.339" style="s2">inevitable that somebody given this much</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:12.520" style="s2">power is going to want to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.339" end="00:11:15.730" style="s2">reality or perception in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.520" end="00:11:18.339" style="s2">manipulate reality well I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.730" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2">inevitable if you don&#39;t build some sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.339" end="00:11:22.899" style="s2">of protection into the system and one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.160" end="00:11:25.420" style="s2">the things that I find very surprising</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.899" end="00:11:29.220" style="s2">about the present moment is that lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.420" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">people are losing touch with why we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.220" end="00:11:35.770" style="s2">counterintuitive rights like the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:37.750" style="s2">to free speech after all we should all</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.770" end="00:11:39.640" style="s2">be able to agree that certain things</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">that people say are just terrible and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.640" end="00:11:43.660" style="s2">would be great if nobody ever said them</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.930" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">again right we don&#39;t need more Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.660" end="00:11:49.690" style="s2">garbage but there is a reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:51.550" style="s2">Constitution itself says actually even</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.690" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">that is protected and the reason it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.550" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">protected is because there is no way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:12:01.660" style="s2">draw the line that protects heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">speech and Bars truly obnoxious speech</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">and because we can&#39;t draw that line</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:08.680" style="s2">surgically the value of heterodox speech</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:10.870" style="s2">is so great and the founders were so</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.680" end="00:12:13.029" style="s2">clear on its importance that they put in</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.870" end="00:12:16.360" style="s2">a protection against governmental in</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.360" end="00:12:22.120" style="s2">unfortunately the founders did not see</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:23.140" style="s2">the present moment they could not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.120" end="00:12:25.089" style="s2">these were people who never saw a</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.649" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">at a mechanistic level that&#39;s something</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:51.640" style="s2">could be making decisions about what I</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.640" end="00:12:55.000" style="s2">and how likely they are to encounter it</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">the founders would never have seen that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.000" end="00:12:59.550" style="s2">coming and because they didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:01.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t properly fear private</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.319" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">governmental control more of it that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.899" end="00:13:30.009" style="s2">have the happier I am</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.670" end="00:13:34.059" style="s2">as basically where that falls out no</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.009" end="00:13:36.939" style="s2">look I&#39;ve said many times that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.059" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">problem with much liberal thought is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.939" end="00:13:42.429" style="s2">that it under rates the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">solution making and that as you make</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.429" end="00:13:45.579" style="s2">solutions you are always inviting</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:47.800" style="s2">unintended consequences and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.579" end="00:13:52.269" style="s2">liberals have a blind spot about those</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.800" end="00:13:54.249" style="s2">things so believe me I have lots of fear</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.269" end="00:13:57.429" style="s2">about what happens if we attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.249" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">regulate our way out of this puzzle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.429" end="00:14:04.470" style="s2">we could make things worse and so I also</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:08.050" style="s2">believe we need to recognize that we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">generally just across the board we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.050" end="00:14:13.569" style="s2">in novel circumstances where the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:17.829" style="s2">documents that we were handed that built</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.829" end="00:14:22.059" style="s2">to find themselves without the ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.350" end="00:14:25.869" style="s2">to address the problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.059" end="00:14:27.610" style="s2">encounter and that means that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.869" end="00:14:29.799" style="s2">figure out what to do about that do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.610" end="00:14:31.329" style="s2">open up a constitutional convention well</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.799" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">I happen to think that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.329" end="00:14:34.360" style="s2">disaster if you did it so I&#39;m not in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:35.829" style="s2">favor of a constitution what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:39.309" style="s2">why would it be a disaster and what do</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.829" end="00:14:41.319" style="s2">you envision this convocation to be like</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.309" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">well if you opened a constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.319" end="00:14:49.299" style="s2">convention suddenly the immense</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:53.049" style="s2">potential to shift the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.299" end="00:14:55.059" style="s2">Republic in favor of one constituency or</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.049" end="00:14:57.790" style="s2">another would be on the table and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.059" end="00:14:59.949" style="s2">don&#39;t see the wisdom available to us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.790" end="00:15:04.149" style="s2">do it in a way that would not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.949" end="00:15:06.999" style="s2">detrimental and what I do see is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.149" end="00:15:09.850" style="s2">of powerful players who would not resist</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.999" end="00:15:12.699" style="s2">the opportunity to attempt to remake the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.850" end="00:15:14.470" style="s2">nation to their interests so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.699" end="00:15:17.110" style="s2">favor that sort of thing but I do favor</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.470" end="00:15:18.850" style="s2">us thinking about the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.110" end="00:15:21.549" style="s2">a general problem with the novelty of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.850" end="00:15:24.610" style="s2">our of our systems relative to the</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.860" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">and we have to have a frank conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.140" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">about what to do about that well if</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">these companies are so big and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:37.740" style="s2">important to anybody who creates content</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.180" end="00:15:40.769" style="s2">Twitter is absolutely essential for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.740" end="00:15:43.500" style="s2">to interface with other thinkers and my</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.769" end="00:15:45.450" style="s2">audience and grow my base and then also</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.500" end="00:15:47.990" style="s2">figure out and grow as a content creator</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.450" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">YouTube has been wonderful for me</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.649" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">given me a voice it&#39;s given me a contact</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:03.810" style="s2">within these frameworks is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.940" end="00:16:06.180" style="s2">to change them is it possible to band</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.810" end="00:16:08.730" style="s2">together to get people to I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.180" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">outcry it doesn&#39;t seem to work and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.730" end="00:16:13.320" style="s2">Congress will go after them at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">point it do we have to reboot everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.320" end="00:16:21.839" style="s2">or we can&#39;t reboot everything so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:24.810" style="s2">unfortunately not quite ready to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.839" end="00:16:27.690" style="s2">about this publicly yet but I will say I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.810" end="00:16:30.360" style="s2">think this is the core question that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.690" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">face which is how exactly do you deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.360" end="00:16:36.380" style="s2">with a mechanism as complex as</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:40.140" style="s2">civilization has become how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.380" end="00:16:41.760" style="s2">upgrade it without taking it offline or</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.140" end="00:16:44.790" style="s2">allowing it to collapse or any of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.760" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">things that we can&#39;t afford and I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.790" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">think there is a category of answers to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.970" end="00:16:52.740" style="s2">this question and the question about</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:56.790" style="s2">what to do about the net is I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.740" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">going to be the first test case question</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.790" end="00:17:02.820" style="s2">is the net is new enough and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:04.890" style="s2">mechanisms by which we might upgrade it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.820" end="00:17:07.730" style="s2">so that it did not become a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.890" end="00:17:12.260" style="s2">nightmare those mechanisms actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.730" end="00:17:15.179" style="s2">exist at our disposal if we can think I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.260" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">use a cliche but think outside the box</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.179" end="00:17:21.780" style="s2">enough to deploy them intelligently we</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">have seen enough components yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.780" end="00:17:26.970" style="s2">are available to us that actually we the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:30.990" style="s2">public can upgrade the net without</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:32.669" style="s2">asking permission to do it okay right we</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.990" end="00:17:34.919" style="s2">can effectively out-compete the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.669" end="00:17:37.230" style="s2">authoritarians in their own landscape</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.919" end="00:17:38.770" style="s2">that sounds like a technical solution do</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.230" end="00:17:40.990" style="s2">you have any ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.770" end="00:17:43.060" style="s2">a cultural solution the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.990" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">interact with one another the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.060" end="00:17:50.020" style="s2">of content that we train ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">favor or the types of interactions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.020" end="00:17:54.220" style="s2">we promote and demote inside of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:18:00.070" style="s2">ourselves that might be playing into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.220" end="00:18:02.860" style="s2">hands of these large behemoths I am Not</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.070" end="00:18:06.090" style="s2">sure those are different questions my</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.860" end="00:18:09.670" style="s2">sense is if you look at for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.090" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">television when I was growing up you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.670" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">not that much younger than the year that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:20.010" style="s2">you&#39;re 40 years yeah I&#39;m 50 yeah in any</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:23.830" style="s2">case when I was growing up everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.010" end="00:18:27.060" style="s2">understood television to be dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.830" end="00:18:29.380" style="s2">and destructive especially to kids and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.060" end="00:18:32.230" style="s2">about the time I was in high school I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.380" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">started saying it&#39;s not the box it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.230" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">business model the the box itself and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:39.040" style="s2">you know the thing that caused me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.370" style="s2">think that was that I spent plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.040" end="00:18:45.090" style="s2">time watching documentaries on public TV</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.370" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t have the sense that I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.090" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">degraded by them in fact I felt enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:52.930" style="s2">I was educated by them and so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:18:54.250" style="s2">it came over the same box and what was</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.930" end="00:18:58.090" style="s2">different was that the business model</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.250" end="00:19:00.730" style="s2">was different now I don&#39;t think NPR or</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.090" end="00:19:02.800" style="s2">PBS are a model of anything at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.730" end="00:19:05.980" style="s2">moment I think they&#39;ve been captured by</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.800" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">something quite dangerous but what I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.980" end="00:19:12.790" style="s2">know is that HBO at first and then later</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:15.940" style="s2">on Netflix and others have taken the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.790" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">very same box that was delivering really</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.940" end="00:19:23.920" style="s2">toxic content and has repaired it by</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:25.660" style="s2">getting people to pay up front for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.920" end="00:19:27.070" style="s2">service and then delivering them a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.660" end="00:19:30.430" style="s2">higher quality good that does not</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.070" end="00:19:32.920" style="s2">require the content to manipulate you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.430" end="00:19:36.190" style="s2">into keeping in your seat okay right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.920" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">the the need to keep you coming back</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.190" end="00:19:42.940" style="s2">commercial break after commercial break</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">caused bad content the HBO version where</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.940" end="00:19:47.380" style="s2">what they do is they sell you the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:48.670" style="s2">to watch some long-form narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.380" end="00:19:50.170" style="s2">they don&#39;t interrupt it with commercials</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.670" end="00:19:51.620" style="s2">actually you can do something very</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.170" end="00:19:53.960" style="s2">sophisticated in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.620" end="00:19:56.750" style="s2">and yeah there&#39;s a lot of garbage out</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.960" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">there still but the point is nothing had</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.750" end="00:20:00.740" style="s2">to change about the tech in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.419" style="s2">change the narrative content and enhance</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.740" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">it and I think the same thing is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.419" end="00:20:09.890" style="s2">on with the net where what we have are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">platforms that because of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.890" end="00:20:15.770" style="s2">competition they are caught in are</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">forced to manipulate us into sticking</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.770" end="00:20:21.130" style="s2">around longer than is healthy for us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:23.720" style="s2">staying on site as they say when our</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.130" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">mental health would suggest that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.720" end="00:20:29.240" style="s2">should get up and turn off the computer</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:32.779" style="s2">or do something else so the real</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.240" end="00:20:36.350" style="s2">question is if we were to fix the net</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.779" end="00:20:39.940" style="s2">and fix the platforms that ride on it</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.350" end="00:20:43.279" style="s2">what would that do to discourse and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.940" end="00:20:46.490" style="s2">guess and it&#39;s not a wild guess it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.279" end="00:20:50.419" style="s2">educated guess my guess is the quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.490" end="00:20:52.370" style="s2">of discourse would go way up and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.419" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">I think I think IDW has been a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.370" end="00:20:57.500" style="s2">demonstration of this so what would</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:21:00.020" style="s2">cause the quality to go up the the need</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.500" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">to no longer keep people stuck around</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.020" end="00:21:04.039" style="s2">but give them something that they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.570" style="s2">rather than something that they&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.039" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">they want or manipulated into wanting</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.570" end="00:21:12.890" style="s2">yes if you fix the incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">around the content and the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.890" end="00:21:19.909" style="s2">between let&#39;s say creators and platforms</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:22.520" style="s2">then that which was delivered the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.909" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">quality of it would go up and people</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.520" end="00:21:29.350" style="s2">would seek out that which served them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">better you know in a video that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.350" end="00:21:33.710" style="s2">filmed of me quite some time ago we</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:37.250" style="s2">talked a little bit about wisdom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.710" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">and I argued that the the core of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.250" end="00:21:41.539" style="s2">was delayed gratification and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.279" style="s2">in the aftermath of releasing that video</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.539" end="00:21:44.659" style="s2">people have pointed me to lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.279" end="00:21:46.250" style="s2">places where other people have argued</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.659" end="00:21:46.669" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually the core of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.250" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.669" end="00:21:52.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a resonant idea and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:56.140" style="s2">point is given good tools wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.370" end="00:21:58.220" style="s2">how to spend your time online will go up</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.140" end="00:21:59.659" style="s2">we don&#39;t have that happening now because</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.220" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">we have antagonists we have very</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.659" end="00:22:03.350" style="s2">sophisticated antagonists who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:03.870" style="s2">deploying very sophisticated machine</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.350" end="00:22:06.360" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.870" end="00:22:08.610" style="s2">to keep us from getting wise to keep us</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.360" end="00:22:10.380" style="s2">coming back from for the the junk food</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.610" end="00:22:11.790" style="s2">that they&#39;re delivering well at the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.380" end="00:22:13.680" style="s2">time I think we can be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.790" end="00:22:16.410" style="s2">generous with at least the tension the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.680" end="00:22:20.370" style="s2">intentionality of the Google whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.410" end="00:22:21.960" style="s2">it&#39;s called in fairness enhancement team</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.370" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">or whatever they have the language</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.960" end="00:22:27.210" style="s2">itself is really telling like how they</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:30.420" style="s2">frame all their little ministries is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.210" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">just it alarm bells Rafi the the nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.420" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">to see here move along ministry what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:39.660" style="s2">hell is that but it seems like in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:42.179" style="s2">project very just video the woman that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.660" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">was caught on cameras higher up on some</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.179" end="00:22:48.120" style="s2">level of the appropriations or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.940" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2">appropriateness committee she wants to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.120" end="00:22:51.420" style="s2">change the election she doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:53.640" style="s2">Trump to happen like they are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.420" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">really scared of Trump they really want</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.640" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">the world to be a better place so it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:02.670" style="s2">seems like they are acting out of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:04.140" style="s2">idea of wisdom or care concern well okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.670" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">is there any way to reach them and get</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.140" end="00:23:09.390" style="s2">them to not go down this direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">no no I&#39;m utterly convinced there is no</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.390" end="00:23:15.330" style="s2">way to reach them these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:17.400" style="s2">maniacs who do not realize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.330" end="00:23:18.780" style="s2">what they&#39;ve become and you know we saw</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.400" end="00:23:21.390" style="s2">this that evergreen yeah was there any</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.780" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">way to reach evergreen still no way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.390" end="00:23:26.210" style="s2">reach which tells you something I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:29.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a model of what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">Google is incapable of questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.670" end="00:23:39.300" style="s2">wisdom of doing what it&#39;s doing now with</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:42.330" style="s2">respect to their point about Trump I too</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.300" end="00:23:47.910" style="s2">think that the election of Trump is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.330" end="00:23:51.030" style="s2">very frightening fact as we are staring</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.910" end="00:23:55.410" style="s2">down the barrel of potential war with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.030" end="00:23:58.650" style="s2">Iran having a guy like Donald Trump in</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.410" end="00:24:01.080" style="s2">charge of whether or not we go that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.650" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">direction makes us much more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.080" end="00:24:04.170" style="s2">I believe and so there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:05.610" style="s2">be said for the question of well what</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.170" end="00:24:08.220" style="s2">does this mean on the other hand the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.610" end="00:24:11.610" style="s2">idea that Google thinks it has the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.220" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">to adjust content so that he doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.610" end="00:24:17.580" style="s2">elected again is the height of hubris</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:19.710" style="s2">and it carries with it of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.580" end="00:24:22.380" style="s2">very obvious danger which Google which</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.710" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">has studied artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.380" end="00:24:27.480" style="s2">should well understand which is if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:29.280" style="s2">start with the conclusion which is I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.480" end="00:24:31.050" style="s2">like to live in a world in which Donald</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.280" end="00:24:33.720" style="s2">Trump doesn&#39;t get elected and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.050" end="00:24:36.570" style="s2">start adjusting content so that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.720" end="00:24:39.270" style="s2">points away from a guy like Trump you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.570" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">arrange us you make it impossible for us</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.270" end="00:24:43.410" style="s2">to have a nuanced conversation you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.790" end="00:24:44.670" style="s2">make it impossible for us to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.410" end="00:24:46.440" style="s2">conversation in which the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.670" end="00:24:49.560" style="s2">counterintuitive plays an important role</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.440" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">because the algorithm you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.560" end="00:24:56.160" style="s2">artificial genius it doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:57.570" style="s2">deserve right its intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.160" end="00:25:01.770" style="s2">stretch in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.570" end="00:25:04.620" style="s2">so the point is look you have to let us</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.770" end="00:25:08.130" style="s2">have discussions and the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.620" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">and Tim Poole yeah are finding</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.130" end="00:25:11.850" style="s2">themselves on the wrong end of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.020" end="00:25:14.130" style="s2">algorithm tells you everything you need</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.850" end="00:25:17.430" style="s2">to know well what does it tell me I just</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.130" end="00:25:19.170" style="s2">I it I just can&#39;t get my head around why</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.430" end="00:25:20.970" style="s2">they would think I am important enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.170" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">to scrub out let me let me put it to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.970" end="00:25:28.860" style="s2">this way it tells you that the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:31.620" style="s2">thinks that you are bad for the future</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.860" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">when in fact I&#39;ve listened to you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.620" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">are a difficult but positive force</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:40.800" style="s2">you&#39;re a difficult force because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:42.600" style="s2">forcing people to look at something they</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.800" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">don&#39;t want to see and you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.600" end="00:25:47.130" style="s2">same thing I encountered the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.460" end="00:25:49.680" style="s2">with the Evergreen story was that good</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:52.200" style="s2">people don&#39;t like a story with black</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.680" end="00:25:54.060" style="s2">bigots black bigots were the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:55.680" style="s2">don&#39;t like a story with black bigots on</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.060" end="00:25:57.990" style="s2">the other hand if there are black bigots</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.680" end="00:26:00.330" style="s2">which we encountered at Evergreen you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.990" end="00:26:02.670" style="s2">can&#39;t decide that story is unreported</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.330" end="00:26:04.410" style="s2">because it goes against the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.670" end="00:26:06.810" style="s2">that you favor you have to say well</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.410" end="00:26:08.130" style="s2">what&#39;s happened why why is that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.810" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">phenomenon that&#39;s occurring in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.130" end="00:26:15.420" style="s2">present and so anyway my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">you and Tim Poole are delivering very</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.420" end="00:26:21.660" style="s2">high quality material and for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:23.340" style="s2">algorithm having to decided to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.660" end="00:26:25.560" style="s2">decided that what you are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.340" end="00:26:27.480" style="s2">actually counterproductive tells you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.560" end="00:26:30.030" style="s2">that the algorithm is not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.480" end="00:26:32.130" style="s2">truth it&#39;s not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">in-depth explorations because what both</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.130" end="00:26:37.250" style="s2">of you are doing is you are exploring</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:40.110" style="s2">things in depth so that people can see</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.250" end="00:26:42.900" style="s2">the horror show they can also see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.110" end="00:26:44.970" style="s2">being lost and in any case I&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.900" end="00:26:46.740" style="s2">any algorithm that would decide that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.970" end="00:26:49.830" style="s2">and/or Tim Poole were on the wrong side</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.740" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">of history because I believe you are on</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">the right side of history and not in as</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:56.670" style="s2">great company well I&#39;m not on the side</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">of those who would rewrite history</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.670" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">we know that at this point well you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:08.550" style="s2">a an inability to look away yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:10.110" style="s2">seems like in the what you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.550" end="00:27:13.020" style="s2">with wisdom that delayed gratification</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.110" end="00:27:16.560" style="s2">there&#39;s also it just makes me wonder</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:18.600" style="s2">what is that desire for us to declare an</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.560" end="00:27:22.710" style="s2">outcome or to be outcome oriented and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.600" end="00:27:26.250" style="s2">seems like an unintuitive principle to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.710" end="00:27:28.530" style="s2">not become outcome oriented in certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.250" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">respects with regards to they want Trump</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.530" end="00:27:31.800" style="s2">elected they want to fix it with</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">evergreen they want to fix the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.800" end="00:27:34.860" style="s2">even though the numbers were fixing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:37.110" style="s2">themselves they wanted to fix these gaps</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:42.660" style="s2">achievements and that equality of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.990" end="00:27:45.150" style="s2">outcome it seems really good it seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.660" end="00:27:48.030" style="s2">like a fool Szold though it seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.150" end="00:27:49.800" style="s2">foolish wisdom do you see that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.030" end="00:27:52.050" style="s2">like you brought that up with Google</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.800" end="00:27:54.180" style="s2">deciding where to go and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.050" end="00:27:58.890" style="s2">muddy the waters to get there well there</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.180" end="00:28:06.170" style="s2">is a way in which something has switched</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.890" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">sides and the desire to stamp out</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.170" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">inquiry at Evergreen or in the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:20.940" style="s2">is obviously paradoxical and the desire</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:23.400" style="s2">to I mean this is Google Google became</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.940" end="00:28:26.460" style="s2">Google because it allowed people to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.400" end="00:28:28.410" style="s2">discover what was actually available in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.460" end="00:28:30.750" style="s2">the world it allowed it indexed it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:33.560" style="s2">enough that we could actually find what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.750" end="00:28:37.640" style="s2">we were looking for and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.560" end="00:28:40.679" style="s2">Google became a kind of next-level</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.640" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">perceptual apparatus just like an eye to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.679" end="00:28:44.820" style="s2">look into civilization and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:47.340" style="s2">in place and now what is that I doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.820" end="00:28:51.289" style="s2">its editing what you can see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.340" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">serving a particular brain it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.289" end="00:28:58.770" style="s2">becoming paternalistic and it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.100" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">decided that it doesn&#39;t want you to look</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.770" end="00:29:03.030" style="s2">at your content for example and evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:06.210" style="s2">it for yourself it&#39;s going to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.030" end="00:29:08.039" style="s2">it for you and just you know disappear</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.210" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">it and if you really want to find it you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.039" end="00:29:14.220" style="s2">can but you and I both know that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">degree to which Google intervenes</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.220" end="00:29:18.900" style="s2">between you and your audience that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.740" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">adjusts your fate going forward they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.900" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">decided that they&#39;ve looked at your</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:25.620" style="s2">content so other people don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.000" style="s2">and what the heck Google is gonna decide</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.620" end="00:29:29.370" style="s2">that yeah that&#39;s like the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.000" end="00:29:32.280" style="s2">deciding that inquiry is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.370" end="00:29:35.220" style="s2">oppression yeah it just it&#39;s it&#39;s odd</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.280" end="00:29:37.470" style="s2">and I tried to design as I developed as</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:40.200" style="s2">a content creator I&#39;m still very early</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.470" end="00:29:42.630" style="s2">in this experiment but I try to design</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.200" end="00:29:45.450" style="s2">content that was complex that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:47.280" style="s2">of used that knee-jerk reaction to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.450" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2">people into the door getting attention</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.280" end="00:29:51.750" style="s2">is important the way that I kept</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.320" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">attention and tried to go forward and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.750" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">manipulate attention or to break apart</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.990" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">attention and to engage intention over</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:03.240" style="s2">the course was to be is to not feed on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:06.120" style="s2">those clickbait things is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.240" end="00:30:07.380" style="s2">upset expectations and have long-form</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.120" end="00:30:09.030" style="s2">conversations with people that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.380" end="00:30:11.159" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t normally have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.030" end="00:30:15.179" style="s2">with and it seems like if the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.159" end="00:30:16.590" style="s2">is somehow miss reading me in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.179" end="00:30:18.690" style="s2">intentions or reading a certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.590" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">intention into it that they that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.690" end="00:30:23.159" style="s2">either can&#39;t process that level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:26.309" style="s2">complexity or that level of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.159" end="00:30:27.900" style="s2">goes against what its handlers want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.309" end="00:30:30.210" style="s2">happen when I think that that level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.900" end="00:30:32.909" style="s2">complexity says we&#39;re exercising right</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.210" end="00:30:34.919" style="s2">now I don&#39;t think any machine could</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.909" end="00:30:38.130" style="s2">actually gauge what we&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.919" end="00:30:39.809" style="s2">here that level of complexity I believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.130" end="00:30:41.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the way forward is the way for us</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.809" end="00:30:45.090" style="s2">to get to a place where we can disagree</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.640" end="00:30:49.140" style="s2">and build something while disagreeing on</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.090" end="00:30:51.570" style="s2">things or whatever we well I I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.140" end="00:30:54.749" style="s2">elsewhere that we missed the boat with</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.570" end="00:30:58.989" style="s2">respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.749" end="00:31:01.239" style="s2">fears about AI that we were expecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.989" end="00:31:04.389" style="s2">robots and that we are actually now</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.239" end="00:31:06.100" style="s2">living the very early stages of the AI</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.389" end="00:31:09.159" style="s2">apocalypse and we don&#39;t even know it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.100" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">because the robots aren&#39;t an important</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.159" end="00:31:14.379" style="s2">factor that what it is is the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:18.940" style="s2">and in some sense the algorithms have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.379" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">started it to think for us now here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.940" end="00:31:27.659" style="s2">very basic question do the executives at</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:30.970" style="s2">Google have an escape from their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.659" end="00:31:33.609" style="s2">algorithmic adjustment of reality or is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.970" end="00:31:35.470" style="s2">this a positive feedback where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.609" end="00:31:37.659" style="s2">executives of Google are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.470" end="00:31:40.210" style="s2">convinced by the algorithms so they</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.659" end="00:31:43.480" style="s2">stupidly set in motion are they going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.210" end="00:31:45.639" style="s2">be reinforced in their wrong think I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.480" end="00:31:47.499" style="s2">hate to use that term Yannick Lee here</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.639" end="00:31:48.940" style="s2">we&#39;re the ones who are they think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.499" end="00:31:50.980" style="s2">involved in wrong thing but to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.940" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">extent that they have deployed an overly</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.980" end="00:31:56.710" style="s2">simplistic view of what&#39;s worth hearing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:59.590" style="s2">and what isn&#39;t are they creating their</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.710" end="00:32:02.649" style="s2">own echo chamber which is then going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.590" end="00:32:05.379" style="s2">deranged them right in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.649" end="00:32:07.149" style="s2">overlords have created the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.379" end="00:32:08.980" style="s2">their undoing and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.149" end="00:32:11.559" style="s2">very much like the scene in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.980" end="00:32:15.100" style="s2">movie where the robots turn on their</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.559" end="00:32:18.309" style="s2">creators the algorithms are inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.100" end="00:32:21.369" style="s2">going to confuse people at Google who</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.309" end="00:32:23.799" style="s2">are programming the algorithms it seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.369" end="00:32:27.159" style="s2">like we everyone swallow a new video</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.799" end="00:32:28.989" style="s2">surfaces from one of those dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.159" end="00:32:30.789" style="s2">companies out in Boston where they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.989" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">a robot Boston Dynamics they beat up the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.789" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">robot now and the robot can sustain a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">beating it&#39;s still if you look at those</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:39.489" style="s2">robots they&#39;re they&#39;re scary they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:41.590" style="s2">funny but they&#39;re not really articulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.489" end="00:32:44.739" style="s2">well they what Google has done is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.590" end="00:32:47.019" style="s2">released robots into our cultural space</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.739" end="00:32:48.549" style="s2">which they&#39;re non-physical robots but</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.019" end="00:32:51.340" style="s2">now they&#39;re going through our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.549" end="00:32:53.379" style="s2">landscape are they any more adroit are</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.340" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">they any less clumsy than the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.379" end="00:32:58.929" style="s2">we see in those videos yeah they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:01.800" style="s2">quite a droid they&#39;re Android oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.929" end="00:33:04.980" style="s2">scenario we can edit that out</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.800" end="00:33:08.070" style="s2">he&#39;s headed somewhere though but it does</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.980" end="00:33:09.420" style="s2">remind me so every once in a while I put</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.070" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">out an evergreen video and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.420" end="00:33:12.510" style="s2">always somebody saying get over this kid</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:13.980" style="s2">you got fired from there I&#39;m like I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.510" end="00:33:15.810" style="s2">a student but you know people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.980" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">understand but I really do think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.810" end="00:33:19.860" style="s2">the Evergreen the situation maps onto</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:22.830" style="s2">other things and what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.860" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">about Google kind of circling the wagons</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.830" end="00:33:26.490" style="s2">or getting their robots to cut them off</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:28.350" style="s2">from discourse they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.490" end="00:33:30.030" style="s2">accountability to the outside world and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:31.470" style="s2">when we don&#39;t have accountability just</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.030" end="00:33:35.340" style="s2">like what happened with the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.470" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">story recently the certain faculty we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.340" end="00:33:39.000" style="s2">trying to get the faculty to have an</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.750" end="00:33:40.980" style="s2">open and honest discussion and every</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.000" end="00:33:43.080" style="s2">layer of authority above the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.980" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">which we&#39;re all supposed to serve the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.080" end="00:33:47.340" style="s2">faculty shut down that discussion they</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:49.080" style="s2">finally had a little bit of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.340" end="00:33:51.000" style="s2">and even within that discussion they</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.080" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t want anybody else to hear them</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.000" end="00:33:56.310" style="s2">speaking they they&#39;ve when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:33:58.860" style="s2">cut ourselves off from that discourse</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.310" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">that damages us more than anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.860" end="00:34:02.490" style="s2">we are unable to actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:04.020" style="s2">world because that which which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.490" end="00:34:06.930" style="s2">designed to protect us from the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.020" end="00:34:08.850" style="s2">ends us ends up creating huge blind</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.930" end="00:34:13.470" style="s2">spots for us going forward yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.850" end="00:34:16.830" style="s2">in fact the point is this authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.470" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">stuff ends in a dystopia every time you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.830" end="00:34:22.679" style="s2">deploy it and we are now seeing every</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">stripe of authoritarian right we saw it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.679" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">at Evergreen I mean evergreen now</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:28.440" style="s2">functions like a little dictatorship and</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.339" end="00:36:12.369" style="s2">it seems like we do need to come</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.970" end="00:36:14.859" style="s2">together on some level and and organize</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.369" end="00:36:17.020" style="s2">or get ready for moving in another</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.859" end="00:36:22.359" style="s2">direction well I&#39;ll give you two answers</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.020" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">one is we need to retool the internet</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.359" end="00:36:29.109" style="s2">which will allow us to walk away from</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.849" style="s2">those who have decided to think on our</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.109" end="00:36:32.200" style="s2">behalf</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.849" end="00:36:34.330" style="s2">that&#39;s one level and that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.200" end="00:36:37.270" style="s2">require some careful technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.330" end="00:36:42.190" style="s2">thinking the other level though involves</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.270" end="00:36:44.830" style="s2">us figuring out how to reject the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.190" end="00:36:48.430" style="s2">diagnosis of us and this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.830" end="00:36:52.810" style="s2">where I think IDW at least for a while</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.430" end="00:36:54.310" style="s2">succeeded when I DW first began to form</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.810" end="00:36:57.490" style="s2">before there was even a name for</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.310" end="00:37:00.190" style="s2">whatever that phenomenon is it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.490" end="00:37:02.970" style="s2">immediately dismissed by a wide range of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.190" end="00:37:06.190" style="s2">people as a conservative phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.970" end="00:37:07.570" style="s2">many people including me kept pointing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.190" end="00:37:09.460" style="s2">out that doesn&#39;t make any sense at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.570" end="00:37:13.270" style="s2">half the people who are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.460" end="00:37:16.030" style="s2">that conversation are actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.270" end="00:37:17.859" style="s2">left-of-centre not only that but</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.030" end="00:37:20.290" style="s2">everybody involved in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.859" end="00:37:22.990" style="s2">is heterodox in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.290" end="00:37:25.900" style="s2">and broadly tolerant so it isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.990" end="00:37:27.100" style="s2">ideological conversation now my point</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.900" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">though is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.100" end="00:37:32.290" style="s2">at first there was a lot of resins to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:34.270" style="s2">the dismissal on the basis that it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.290" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">conservative but figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.270" end="00:37:40.150" style="s2">respond to it without becoming enraged</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:43.210" style="s2">and saying no that simply doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.150" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">the fact you actually caused an update</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.210" end="00:37:47.830" style="s2">to people&#39;s model of what they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:51.340" style="s2">seeing so I guess what I&#39;m saying is we</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.830" end="00:37:53.910" style="s2">have evidence of places where stigma</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.340" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">that is supposed to shut down one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.910" end="00:37:58.270" style="s2">access to an audience was actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:01.990" style="s2">repelled because the audience is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.270" end="00:38:05.860" style="s2">interested and there is enough openness</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.990" end="00:38:10.510" style="s2">to an analysis of what&#39;s worth listening</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.860" end="00:38:11.650" style="s2">to that in fact we won at least for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.510" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">while mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:15.610" style="s2">the threat of a snake the stigma will</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:18.220" style="s2">always be popping up it seems like no</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.610" end="00:38:20.530" style="s2">matter where any particular people</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">congregate they will be slandered and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.530" end="00:38:24.730" style="s2">and the weird thing is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.480" end="00:38:27.010" style="s2">people there are these useful idiots</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.730" end="00:38:28.750" style="s2">there are these these these little</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.010" end="00:38:30.910" style="s2">gaggles of groups that just want to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.750" end="00:38:33.430" style="s2">around and stigmatize people and those</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.910" end="00:38:38.250" style="s2">are being used that that that action</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.430" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">itself is so easily feeds into larger</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:43.240" style="s2">authoritarian movements because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:45.030" style="s2">like it shuts down people&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.240" end="00:38:46.780" style="s2">really engage with things and I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.030" end="00:38:50.230" style="s2">maybe we won&#39;t have time to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.780" end="00:38:53.590" style="s2">it right now but about the mechanics of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.230" end="00:38:57.460" style="s2">stigma and how do we see it in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.590" end="00:38:59.800" style="s2">and and shut it down or or use it in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.460" end="00:39:04.180" style="s2">proper way well the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:05.410" style="s2">is that you know we I&#39;ve said in many of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.180" end="00:39:07.120" style="s2">these places where I&#39;ve been asked to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.410" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">talk about the free speech crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.120" end="00:39:11.140" style="s2">don&#39;t think this is a free speech crisis</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">part of the problem with the framing of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.140" end="00:39:15.250" style="s2">what we&#39;re facing as a free speech</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:17.950" style="s2">crisis is that it focuses too much on</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.250" end="00:39:20.200" style="s2">the speaker when in fact what we saw at</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.950" end="00:39:23.500" style="s2">Evergreen on other college campuses is</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.200" end="00:39:25.630" style="s2">an attempt to prevent people from being</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.500" end="00:39:28.510" style="s2">able to listen to what they want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.630" end="00:39:30.610" style="s2">right you shut down a speaker it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.510" end="00:39:31.870" style="s2">their rights that are the most important</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.610" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">the question is what about all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.870" end="00:39:35.800" style="s2">people who wanted to hear what they had</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:38.570" style="s2">to say who don&#39;t now have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.800" end="00:39:42.050" style="s2">access it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.570" end="00:39:44.570" style="s2">point of the stigma is to interrupt your</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.050" end="00:39:47.720" style="s2">ability to seek content that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.570" end="00:39:49.640" style="s2">engage with and in some sense that means</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.720" end="00:39:53.150" style="s2">that the solution to the stigma problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.640" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">is not to deal with the stigmatizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.150" end="00:39:58.190" style="s2">itself but to make sure that it does not</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:40:00.140" style="s2">interrupt the ability of an audience to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.190" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">find the content that it wants to engage</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.140" end="00:40:03.830" style="s2">with you know there is a frightening</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:08.050" style="s2">aspect of that I don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.830" end="00:40:10.850" style="s2">engaging white nationalist content but</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.050" end="00:40:13.250" style="s2">the reason that the founders protected</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.850" end="00:40:15.170" style="s2">speech the way they did is that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.250" end="00:40:19.400" style="s2">trusted that the net effect of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.170" end="00:40:23.660" style="s2">protecting all speech is to allow</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.400" end="00:40:28.250" style="s2">heterodox ideas to flourish when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.660" end="00:40:30.380" style="s2">are right and for that we have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.250" end="00:40:33.830" style="s2">a certain amount of speech that on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.380" end="00:40:36.440" style="s2">whole we would rather not exist is in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.830" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">your estimation is there forms of speech</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.440" end="00:40:41.120" style="s2">that are so toxic that they can destroy</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">or corrupt everybody&#39;s mind that should</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.120" end="00:40:45.560" style="s2">be like some sort of science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">novel like the the book that will upload</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.560" end="00:40:48.680" style="s2">us all into the net or some something</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">very deadly or dangerous is there a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.680" end="00:40:54.410" style="s2">combination of words that can ruin all</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:57.410" style="s2">of civilizations that more words can</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.410" end="00:40:59.360" style="s2">solve you have to you have to accept a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.410" end="00:41:00.590" style="s2">qualified answer on that point I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.360" end="00:41:05.900" style="s2">think there&#39;s a simple answer so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.590" end="00:41:08.510" style="s2">gonna qualify it the there is no set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.900" end="00:41:11.360" style="s2">words that does that but given a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.510" end="00:41:13.250" style="s2">particular context there is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.360" end="00:41:15.470" style="s2">words that will set us in motion in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.250" end="00:41:17.300" style="s2">particular direction that is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.470" end="00:41:21.410" style="s2">dangerous and the point i&#39;ve been making</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.300" end="00:41:25.210" style="s2">is that economic contraction the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.410" end="00:41:30.590" style="s2">experience of the opposite of growth</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.210" end="00:41:34.780" style="s2">puts people in mind of who to go after</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.590" end="00:41:37.610" style="s2">in order to restore growth for their</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.780" end="00:41:41.500" style="s2">family for their for their kin group and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.610" end="00:41:44.300" style="s2">so my point is we are actually wired for</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.500" end="00:41:46.370" style="s2">messages that will cause us to turn on</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.300" end="00:41:49.550" style="s2">people who are vulnerable this is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.370" end="00:41:51.980" style="s2">happened in Germany in the 30s and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.550" end="00:41:54.980" style="s2">can happen anytime so to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.980" end="00:41:57.170" style="s2">that what we have are people like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.980" end="00:42:00.350" style="s2">would argue Donald Trump played on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.170" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily what he</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.350" end="00:42:06.260" style="s2">is interested in but to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.390" end="00:42:08.360" style="s2">people&#39;s cognitive structures were</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.260" end="00:42:10.040" style="s2">looking for evidence of somebody who was</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.360" end="00:42:12.430" style="s2">gonna point out which group we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.040" end="00:42:13.600" style="s2">turn on well he&#39;s played on</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.430" end="00:42:16.970" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.600" end="00:42:19.190" style="s2">anti-immigrant sentiment and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.970" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">distrust between populations and things</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.190" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">like that it&#39;s part of how he got</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:26.300" style="s2">elected and so we have to beware that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:28.790" style="s2">live in a period in which messages that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.300" end="00:42:30.620" style="s2">we do not want to spread are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.790" end="00:42:32.660" style="s2">be more resonant than we would like them</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.620" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">to be it doesn&#39;t mean that those same</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.660" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">messages would have any resonance</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:40.130" style="s2">whatsoever were we living in a boom okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:42.590" style="s2">all right so yeah the answer is usually</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.130" end="00:42:43.970" style="s2">not just the words themselves but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.590" end="00:42:46.280" style="s2">context in which those words might</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.970" end="00:42:49.850" style="s2">ignite a large fire yeah it may be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.280" end="00:42:51.380" style="s2">simple way to say it is there are no</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.850" end="00:42:53.570" style="s2">words that will do it but there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.380" end="00:42:56.180" style="s2">combinations of contexts and words that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.570" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">will yeah if google goes through and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.180" end="00:43:01.250" style="s2">starts to banish us from certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.750" style="s2">nutrients let&#39;s say and thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.250" end="00:43:05.030" style="s2">these things are bad but just goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.750" end="00:43:07.220" style="s2">overboard then it could lead us to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.030" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">place where on a psychological or</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.220" end="00:43:13.610" style="s2">cultural level we&#39;re getting hungry or</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:17.900" style="s2">needing for some sort of upheaval that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.610" end="00:43:19.580" style="s2">could otherwise be avoided I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.900" end="00:43:23.090" style="s2">that&#39;s true but maybe at a more basic</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.580" end="00:43:25.550" style="s2">level the thing that we should the thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.090" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">that we need most is our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.550" end="00:43:30.680" style="s2">think collectively clearly and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">requires that nobody decide which</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.680" end="00:43:35.920" style="s2">fraction of the information we are able</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:38.840" style="s2">to see as bad as it is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.920" end="00:43:41.120" style="s2">there are messages out there that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.840" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">may spread that are dangerous it is far</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.120" end="00:43:45.080" style="s2">worse that somebody decide that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">know which messages we get to see and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.080" end="00:43:50.450" style="s2">which ones we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:52.280" style="s2">so that right is a very important one it</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.450" end="00:43:54.920" style="s2">is not synonymous with free speech it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.280" end="00:43:56.540" style="s2">related but it is not the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.920" end="00:43:58.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.540" end="00:44:01.700" style="s2">protect our ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.280" end="00:44:04.180" style="s2">collectively because it&#39;s quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.700" end="00:44:06.280" style="s2">that people wielding algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.180" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">have set us on a very dangerous course</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.280" end="00:44:11.700" style="s2">in bike thinking collectively it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:15.099" style="s2">opposite of groupthink in a way it sits</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.700" end="00:44:17.970" style="s2">together alone or together against or</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.099" end="00:44:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s another way of framing</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.970" end="00:44:22.780" style="s2">interpersonal communication that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.440" end="00:44:26.109" style="s2">come down to everybody thinking in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.780" end="00:44:28.930" style="s2">rigid form but but interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.109" end="00:44:31.750" style="s2">opposite of rigidity sometimes yes humor</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.930" end="00:44:34.059" style="s2">and the ugly and the unnecessary the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.750" end="00:44:36.280" style="s2">uncomfortable I&#39;ll immediately put it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.059" end="00:44:38.410" style="s2">this way there is no reason that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.280" end="00:44:40.390" style="s2">language would have evolved to just</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.410" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">synchronize people&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.390" end="00:44:44.380" style="s2">synchronizing people&#39;s thinking is not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:47.710" style="s2">very interesting phenomenon and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.380" end="00:44:50.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t would not have caused the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.710" end="00:44:53.500" style="s2">evolution of something is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.380" end="00:44:55.510" style="s2">miraculous as human language so yes it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.500" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">is true that sometimes people use</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.510" end="00:45:00.339" style="s2">language to cause groupthink but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">most interesting thing that language</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.339" end="00:45:04.839" style="s2">does is it allows minds that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:07.569" style="s2">different to compare notes and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.839" end="00:45:09.099" style="s2">upgrade each other and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.569" end="00:45:11.380" style="s2">mean by our ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.099" end="00:45:16.030" style="s2">collectively I&#39;m imagining something</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.380" end="00:45:19.510" style="s2">much more like a an analog of a brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.030" end="00:45:21.549" style="s2">that exists in between us that actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.510" end="00:45:24.359" style="s2">does result in us getting smarter over</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.549" end="00:45:26.980" style="s2">time and to the extent that Google</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.359" end="00:45:29.170" style="s2">believes that it knows what that brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.980" end="00:45:31.569" style="s2">should think about stuff we ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.170" end="00:45:35.349" style="s2">quite frightened of Google yeah again</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.569" end="00:45:37.990" style="s2">they&#39;ve put like an Android thing into</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.349" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">our head and an insert of some sort some</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.990" end="00:45:42.790" style="s2">sort of Borg Ian a modifier or enhancer</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:45.010" style="s2">that does the opposite of enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.790" end="00:45:49.540" style="s2">world I have to say when I walk down the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.010" end="00:45:51.790" style="s2">street now and I see apples earbuds</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.540" end="00:45:53.710" style="s2">hanging out of people&#39;s ears I do sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.790" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">of have a sense I&#39;m not sure why it</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.710" end="00:45:59.859" style="s2">strikes me as more dire than when they</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:01.270" style="s2">had you know your phones with cords but</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.859" end="00:46:03.339" style="s2">there is something about a large</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.270" end="00:46:07.559" style="s2">fraction of the population walking</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.339" end="00:46:10.119" style="s2">around with a particular conspicuous</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.559" end="00:46:11.859" style="s2">electronic augmentation hanging out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.119" end="00:46:14.930" style="s2">both ears that makes me think oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.859" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">goodness where we ended up</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.280" end="00:46:23.670" style="s2">that far apart what I&#39;m hoping is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.230" end="00:46:26.550" style="s2">you&#39;ll come down and we can have further</p>
