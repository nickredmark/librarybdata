<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">basis with basics of transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">like animals when they&#39;d fly the birds</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.019" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">particular times yeah now that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:53.370" style="s2">in the flow yeah means ahead of the flow</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:56.549" style="s2">we need to keep back on the flow right</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:57.299" style="s2">yeah right to the flow coming into flow</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.549" end="00:02:59.639" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.299" end="00:03:01.769" style="s2">coming into flow and you know we see a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.639" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">mindfulness revolution and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.769" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">revolution people are looking to access</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">this the ogre is being because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">yeah I think we&#39;re looking for at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">level I believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:21.459" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah we&#39;re looking for unity but</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:24.220" style="s2">is it this is there&#39;s a difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.459" end="00:03:26.280" style="s2">about unity because in some important</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.220" end="00:03:29.409" style="s2">sense it can never be totally attained</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.280" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s so it&#39;s almost like a dance</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.409" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:36.849" style="s2">the dance is playing out a hole over</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:38.890" style="s2">time but at any one moment you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.849" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">the dance you can&#39;t just chop it up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.890" end="00:03:42.549" style="s2">in the whole thing it&#39;s the whole song</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:46.420" style="s2">right it&#39;s the full process of the art</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.549" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the making of it and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.420" end="00:03:49.660" style="s2">I think this is another core existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:51.849" style="s2">thing and I think a lot of difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.660" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">and suffering comes from this but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.849" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2">think deep down because we are searching</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:58.810" style="s2">for this unity I think sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">get a glimpse and they think of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.810" end="00:04:01.510" style="s2">they want to be and then they think how</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:03.159" style="s2">could I ever attain that right there</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.510" end="00:04:06.819" style="s2">they&#39;re wanting something final and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.159" end="00:04:08.709" style="s2">perfect but but final perfection is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.819" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">something that&#39;s attainable for us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.709" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">in this constant relationship of making</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">and becoming right so so the constant</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:17.350" style="s2">need to transform the fear that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:19.959" style="s2">night will come that the darkness will</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.350" end="00:04:21.579" style="s2">come that is the case oh yeah right but</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">we can come into relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.579" end="00:04:25.539" style="s2">other and that we can help each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">through and bit by bit we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.539" end="00:04:29.289" style="s2">better world but it&#39;s it&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">to be a final utopia there&#39;ll always be</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.289" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">problems there&#39;ll always be things to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">solve is Raelians will rains will an ego</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:39.669" style="s2">will always continue to keep going off</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:41.410" style="s2">paths you stay ego wants to them to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.669" end="00:04:43.000" style="s2">the man and they&#39;re the big people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.410" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">right now the Chiefs and all the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.000" end="00:04:46.840" style="s2">it right but the true Warriors are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">people that lead their people in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">better way right a share and care and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:51.820" style="s2">will be with loyalty and honor and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">that stuff yes if</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.820" end="00:04:55.240" style="s2">if a lot of us can start to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">live that way a little bit more yes I</p>
