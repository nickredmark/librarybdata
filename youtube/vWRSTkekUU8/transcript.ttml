<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">acknowledge is sinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.389" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">it only has so many resources on it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:18.600" style="s2">we&#39;re overusing them but and we know</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:21.650" style="s2">there&#39;s often the distant lands a game B</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.600" end="00:00:24.510" style="s2">of abundance anti rivalry so Omni way</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.650" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">what would be the best way to find game</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">go towards it instead what we would want</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">is many vessels going out and when</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">somebody does find it they can call in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">the rest and so that is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">doing in game B is finding the mini</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">vessels that are ours to steer and going</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">it we will call in the rest and as we go</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:09.000" style="s2">we are calling in the rest but coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">into game B and wondering where this</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t getting us there any faster find</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">your vessel either jump on board someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">that&#39;s already there and offer to help</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">crew it or start your own vessel and ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:30.829" style="s2">for other people to come help crew it</p>
