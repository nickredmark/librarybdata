<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:07.309" style="s2">okay this is a little video to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:11.719" style="s2">about insight what it means to incite</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.309" end="00:00:15.590" style="s2">emergent capacities and how it relates</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.719" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">in some respect to developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.590" end="00:00:22.410" style="s2">developmental capacities in how it</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t relate to the what we usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.410" end="00:00:29.099" style="s2">think of as developmental stages or</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:37.500" style="s2">developmental capacities now what I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.099" end="00:00:42.920" style="s2">to use in terms of stage theory is some</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:47.719" style="s2">of you may be familiar with Fisher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.920" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">skill set theory skill theory of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.719" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">development and it represents what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">call a theory that&#39;s based on a natural</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:03.949" style="s2">hierarchy in other words there are no</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">assumptions about progress in his theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.949" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">the the stages are based upon a natural</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">hierarchy so natural hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">something for example you have to be two</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">feet tall before you can get to be three</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:20.540" style="s2">feet tall you have to be three feet tall</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">before you can get to be four feet tall</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.540" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">natural hierarchy would be in Fisher</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">sets that you have to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">systems before you can handle systems of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.490" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">systems so natural hierarchy is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">really just a hierarchy by definition</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">not by any assumptions of what is higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">or lower in levels so I really attracted</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">to developmental theories that do not</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">have a developmental bias in them but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">are the hierarchy comes out of just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">natural hierarchy natural hierarchy has</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">got to be two years old before you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">be three years old these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">hierarchies that are just natural or</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">trivial by definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">so Fisher&#39;s skill set theory starts with</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">around three to four months we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">skills that he calls single actions so a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:29.260" style="s2">toddler a new toddler might reach for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:33.640" style="s2">something so that would be us a single</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.260" end="00:02:36.519" style="s2">action and we could just make a dot</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.640" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">there and then around seventy seven to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.519" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">eight months</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:49.150" style="s2">Fisher calls simple mapping so you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">take this action and you map it to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.150" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">know you map it to your pet rabbit or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:00.940" style="s2">something so you have a you have simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:04.420" style="s2">mappings around seven to eight months</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.940" end="00:03:07.090" style="s2">and then so you reach for another pet</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.420" end="00:03:10.810" style="s2">and you have a different type of toy</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.090" end="00:03:13.060" style="s2">let&#39;s say and you map on that the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.810" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">stage he calls systems so you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:21.310" style="s2">simple systems and they emerge around</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">eleven to thirteen months so you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.310" end="00:03:33.130" style="s2">then take this and have a system that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">your mind is a system of toys so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.130" end="00:03:39.730" style="s2">you can reach if this action is reach</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">you can reach for toys they&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.730" end="00:03:45.669" style="s2">the action is no longer mapped onto a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:48.940" style="s2">simple rep simple thing but on to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.669" end="00:03:52.900" style="s2">system you can your mom can tell you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:04:00.069" style="s2">play with your toys so there are simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.900" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">systems then the this this set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.069" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">actions skills then gets reiterated as</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">representations so now we&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:18.969" style="s2">something less concrete in more</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:20.329" style="s2">representation so around two years you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.969" end="00:04:23.210" style="s2">have you&#39;ll see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.329" end="00:04:25.449" style="s2">similarity single representations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.210" end="00:04:29.259" style="s2">then you have mappings of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.449" end="00:04:36.500" style="s2">representations and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.259" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">systems of representations and by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.500" end="00:04:42.099" style="s2">time you get the systems of reputations</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">you&#39;re out around six to seven years old</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.099" end="00:04:53.349" style="s2">and then the third level is a level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:56.349" style="s2">abstractions and so there&#39;s single</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.349" end="00:04:56.349" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.379" end="00:05:05.169" style="s2">there&#39;s mapping of abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.469" end="00:05:05.169" style="s2">there are their systems of abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:13.460" style="s2">that brings us anyway up to 23 to 25</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.069" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">years that this is emerging so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.460" end="00:05:31.729" style="s2">happens is over time then what we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">is a cognitive capacity that is grown</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:41.449" style="s2">into complexity so some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:43.539" style="s2">are systems and we can make systems of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.449" end="00:05:46.129" style="s2">systems some of these actually represent</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.539" end="00:05:48.529" style="s2">systems so this would be a meta system</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.129" end="00:05:50.810" style="s2">and then there&#39;s mappings on to each</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.529" end="00:05:54.589" style="s2">other there&#39;s mapping into a system as</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.810" end="00:05:57.830" style="s2">whole things map onto concept concepts</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.589" end="00:06:01.460" style="s2">map onto abstractions and we have what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.830" end="00:06:04.490" style="s2">it what could be the whole cognitive or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.460" end="00:06:08.710" style="s2">metaphysical framework of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:15.229" style="s2">and this can grow from systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.710" end="00:06:17.569" style="s2">as common sense to meta systemic so</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.229" end="00:06:22.669" style="s2">you&#39;ve been able to organize this</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.569" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">systems of systems to paradigmatic Pig</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.669" end="00:06:28.759" style="s2">Matic so you can take systems of systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.180" end="00:06:31.659" style="s2">and organize them into paradigms and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.759" end="00:06:34.659" style="s2">then you can actually get to be meta</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.659" end="00:06:34.659" style="s2">paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.090" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">so this is by the time we are gone</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:49.350" style="s2">through enough cognitive development and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:52.260" style="s2">skillset development and language</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.350" end="00:06:55.140" style="s2">development then the framework that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:58.820" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with our belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.140" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">our action inquiry system can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.820" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">complex so I want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:11.970" style="s2">difference between inspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:16.590" style="s2">insight from this theory skit from this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.970" end="00:07:19.980" style="s2">skill set theory so if we have and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.590" end="00:07:23.550" style="s2">just do a simple grid here all of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.980" end="00:07:26.280" style="s2">represent depending on what scale are</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.550" end="00:07:29.490" style="s2">you are they could be systems so this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.280" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">could be a mapping of systems or could</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.490" end="00:07:36.390" style="s2">be a mapping of representations it could</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:41.100" style="s2">be a mapping of actions whatever level</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.390" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">of complexity who have this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.100" end="00:07:48.750" style="s2">is your paradigm okay the actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:52.920" style="s2">metaphysical paradigm that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.750" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">operating under that organizes reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.920" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">for you in a very very complex way and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">when someone if you add inspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:11.580" style="s2">it then what I think you do is you learn</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">how you can actually build on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.580" end="00:08:18.630" style="s2">further so you can end up creating some</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:25.640" style="s2">kind of larger synthesis and and build</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.630" end="00:08:28.920" style="s2">on your paradigm through inspiration so</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.640" end="00:08:31.860" style="s2">and just another caveat I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.920" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">Fisher&#39;s skill set theory works for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.860" end="00:08:41.089" style="s2">certain type of mind that dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.169" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">dualistic mind there are cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.089" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">studies that show that intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:49.350" style="s2">sophistication does not</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:53.100" style="s2">in fact have to grow this way but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.350" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">just a caveat so if we but if we stick</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.100" end="00:09:01.610" style="s2">with this way of organizing intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:01.610" style="s2">sophistication and cognitive skill</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.090" end="00:09:08.400" style="s2">incapacity developmental capacity once</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.340" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2">we have a paradigm we operated under</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.400" end="00:09:15.810" style="s2">certain paradigm and we have inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.100" end="00:09:18.270" style="s2">we can build on that paradigm we learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.810" end="00:09:23.180" style="s2">how to build new entities completely new</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.270" end="00:09:26.790" style="s2">ideas new mappings new entities to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.180" end="00:09:31.230" style="s2">problem-solve but if we add insight</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.790" end="00:09:33.950" style="s2">insight is less developmental so this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.230" end="00:09:36.830" style="s2">a developmental progression it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.950" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">transformative and it has a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.830" end="00:09:45.960" style="s2">deconstruction they&#39;ve added dynamic to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">it so in what insight does is the that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.960" end="00:09:50.700" style="s2">you have the organism has this paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">much of it has by now is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:56.580" style="s2">unconscious and yet the organism is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">trying to solve problems the organism</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.580" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">the human being is in constant adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:05.190" style="s2">tension and trying to solve problems</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.460" end="00:10:35.850" style="s2">of these actions that got interpreted in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:40.770" style="s2">a certain way all of a sudden the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:44.130" style="s2">insight is that either this is a false</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.770" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">mapping and it might or there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.130" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">trauma that might be associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">or that the mapping is arbitrary and not</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:57.870" style="s2">and and so that there&#39;s other options to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">the way this mapping and its</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.870" end="00:11:02.040" style="s2">ramifications could be the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:07.589" style="s2">they are that the mapping is arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.040" end="00:11:10.050" style="s2">or it&#39;s based on conditions that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.589" end="00:11:11.790" style="s2">limiting limiting conditions so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.050" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">example there&#39;s that great movie of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.790" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">William Randolph Hearst and he maps his</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:26.420" style="s2">the word rosebud onto his sleigh and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">that becomes a system of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.420" end="00:11:34.770" style="s2">trauma that stays with him forever by</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:37.250" style="s2">the time he builds on that system then</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.770" end="00:11:42.210" style="s2">he&#39;s operating under a paradigm of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.250" end="00:11:45.570" style="s2">paranoia and and very very high</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.210" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">competitive action logics so insight</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.570" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">what insight does is somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:12:00.089" style="s2">organism realizes that there is malware</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">or there is an error deep inside this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.089" end="00:12:06.839" style="s2">huge paradigm and what happens then is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:09.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s a shift that happens this</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.839" end="00:12:13.410" style="s2">whole mapping this whole system gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.240" end="00:12:18.029" style="s2">reorganized and it gets reorganized for</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.410" end="00:12:22.350" style="s2">example let&#39;s say it gets reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.029" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">like this so now it&#39;s a different type</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.350" end="00:12:29.870" style="s2">of system and then all the other ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:32.459" style="s2">that all the other ideas abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.870" end="00:12:35.580" style="s2">assumptions that have been built up on</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.459" end="00:12:39.390" style="s2">this have to then fall into place in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.580" end="00:12:43.740" style="s2">different ways because they were all all</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.390" end="00:12:46.050" style="s2">these other mappings were correct or</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.740" end="00:12:48.300" style="s2">efficient mappings but now that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.050" end="00:12:51.180" style="s2">something in here has been reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.300" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">then the entire system gets reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.180" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">and all these kinds of insights the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">insights cascade and new systems new</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:09.329" style="s2">systems of systems cascade out of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:13.870" style="s2">the deconstruction of this part of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.329" end="00:13:18.250" style="s2">whole architecture of reality so</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:20.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what in insight is an insight</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.250" end="00:13:24.190" style="s2">works at this level and I did have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.710" end="00:13:29.020" style="s2">conversation with Zach Stein who was you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.190" end="00:13:31.810" style="s2">know one of fishers students and is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.020" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">working in developmental theory here and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.810" end="00:13:37.540" style="s2">he did say that insight isn&#39;t is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t is not part of this dynamic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.540" end="00:13:44.260" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s when you have a an insight</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:45.910" style="s2">into something that was prior previously</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.260" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">laid down gets shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.910" end="00:13:51.250" style="s2">reconstruction reconstructed so that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">architecture then shifts along with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.250" end="00:14:06.400" style="s2">so now in terms of developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">if we have this architecture and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.400" end="00:14:12.090" style="s2">going to relate this to developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:15.820" style="s2">theory and collective insight if we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.090" end="00:14:18.700" style="s2">this architecture and let&#39;s say this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.820" end="00:14:22.030" style="s2">one person and this is another person</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.700" end="00:14:24.130" style="s2">and this person has a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.030" end="00:14:26.770" style="s2">architecture is not working at a meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.130" end="00:14:34.630" style="s2">system systemic level this person is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.770" end="00:14:36.670" style="s2">working at a meta systemic level and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.630" end="00:14:41.170" style="s2">this one&#39;s working at a system level</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.670" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say and let&#39;s say that their</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.170" end="00:14:52.930" style="s2">constructs are mapped here very the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:54.340" style="s2">constructs above let&#39;s say the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.930" end="00:14:57.570" style="s2">systemic level here</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.340" end="00:15:02.500" style="s2">they just don&#39;t appear for this person</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.570" end="00:15:06.340" style="s2">so if the process is working to</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.500" end="00:15:09.130" style="s2">disambiguate or to shift some</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.340" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">assumptions in this territory then of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.130" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">course there&#39;s going to be no</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">contribution here but the higher or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:26.020" style="s2">the more complex the assumption the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:26.830" style="s2">shallower the insight so an insight that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.020" end="00:15:28.630" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:32.230" style="s2">deep in this architecture has the power</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.630" end="00:15:35.530" style="s2">to shift much more the architecture then</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.230" end="00:15:38.080" style="s2">an insight higher up so these would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.530" end="00:15:43.420" style="s2">anything that shifts higher up in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.080" end="00:15:45.280" style="s2">complexity represents makes us makes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.420" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">less significant change in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.280" end="00:15:50.080" style="s2">architecture now there is some downward</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">causation so for example a person could</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.080" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">have an insight at the conceptual level</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:16:01.320" style="s2">that then requires something and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:04.120" style="s2">in the deeper levels must shift but most</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.320" end="00:16:08.140" style="s2">transformation does not happen that way</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.120" end="00:16:15.070" style="s2">most transformation most organisms most</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.140" end="00:16:19.780" style="s2">people resist having structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.070" end="00:16:22.210" style="s2">more complex transform deeper more</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.780" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">embodied structures so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.210" end="00:16:31.380" style="s2">component here but in general the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:34.180" style="s2">biggest insights are deeper in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.380" end="00:16:37.720" style="s2">architecture of the cognition or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.180" end="00:16:41.650" style="s2">organism so so if we&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.720" end="00:16:44.940" style="s2">transform some basic collective insights</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.650" end="00:16:48.960" style="s2">that a basic human level then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.940" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">tension between the way this person</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.960" end="00:16:55.660" style="s2">assumptions and architecture have been</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.660" end="00:17:05.050" style="s2">been drawn will produce authentic chaos</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.710" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">so instead of the organism itself trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.050" end="00:17:11.800" style="s2">to find adaptive fit there is something</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">about being a collective process where</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.800" end="00:17:19.480" style="s2">this system this collective system has</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:25.050" style="s2">some kind of incoherence here because</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.480" end="00:17:28.810" style="s2">the mapping is different and so the both</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.050" end="00:17:33.370" style="s2">individuals the system tries to find a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.810" end="00:17:38.520" style="s2">new coherence at a very deep level and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.370" end="00:17:40.040" style="s2">and when that happens then the the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.520" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">architecture of both</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.040" end="00:17:51.640" style="s2">individuals have to shift so that this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">is innocence developmentally dependent</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.640" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">depending upon if you&#39;re working for</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:18:03.550" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for insights at higher and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:08.360" style="s2">higher capacities but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.550" end="00:18:11.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the individual that has</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.360" end="00:18:14.810" style="s2">many more layers of architecture and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.960" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">meaning that have built on an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.810" end="00:18:24.890" style="s2">instability at a lower level so this</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.750" end="00:19:07.190" style="s2">incite this transformation than someone</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.190" end="00:19:16.750" style="s2">the actual problem and perhaps has been</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.360" end="00:20:54.060" style="s2">potential that as this architecture gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.850" end="00:20:57.920" style="s2">laid down in the organism and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.060" end="00:20:57.920" style="s2">that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.210" end="00:21:11.489" style="s2">kind of an error or confusion in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.999" end="00:21:16.469" style="s2">mapping here and so as the organiz</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.489" end="00:21:25.229" style="s2">architecture gets laid down the organism</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.469" end="00:21:32.969" style="s2">is in some kind of pressure to find the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.229" end="00:21:36.059" style="s2">solution to this this not so efficient</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.969" end="00:21:40.589" style="s2">or not this this thing that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.059" end="00:21:42.719" style="s2">is it&#39;s not having adaptive fit and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.589" end="00:21:45.259" style="s2">there are two strategies that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.719" end="00:21:50.190" style="s2">organism can go through the organism can</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.259" end="00:21:54.450" style="s2">if they&#39;re lucky find it directly but</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:22:03.029" style="s2">let&#39;s say this adaptive fit is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.450" end="00:22:07.139" style="s2">of cultural shadow so let&#39;s say instead</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.029" end="00:22:09.929" style="s2">of this fit being a individual problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.139" end="00:22:14.179" style="s2">it&#39;s a cultural shadow so let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.929" end="00:22:14.179" style="s2">cultural shadow is a developmental bias</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.320" end="00:22:23.219" style="s2">and a developmental bias is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.049" end="00:22:28.639" style="s2">progress hierarchal progress equals</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.219" end="00:22:28.639" style="s2">growth so this is basically the Western</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.479" end="00:22:37.649" style="s2">bias growth toward goodness</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:41.609" style="s2">so as the organism is coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.649" end="00:22:45.659" style="s2">let&#39;s say conventionally blue stage of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.609" end="00:22:47.639" style="s2">development and realizing that realizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.659" end="00:22:49.580" style="s2">that just following the rules doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.639" end="00:22:52.229" style="s2">work that&#39;s going to create an</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.580" end="00:22:56.519" style="s2">evolutionary or not an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.229" end="00:22:58.879" style="s2">developmental tension to go into another</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.519" end="00:23:02.070" style="s2">strategy and to complexify so now you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.879" end="00:23:04.710" style="s2">complexify make an object out of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.070" end="00:23:07.229" style="s2">previous stage and you complexify into</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.710" end="00:23:09.359" style="s2">orange let&#39;s say because this is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.229" end="00:23:12.679" style="s2">the society the cultural conditions</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.359" end="00:23:15.299" style="s2">offer you have this level but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.679" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">sooner or later after you get a job and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.299" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">a wife and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.860" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">two houses and five cars and your</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:25.410" style="s2">existential crisis has not gone away</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.690" style="s2">then that produces a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.410" end="00:23:30.120" style="s2">tension to get even more complex and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.690" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">let&#39;s say you realize duh it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.120" end="00:23:36.330" style="s2">people stupid and so then you make an</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.410" end="00:23:38.670" style="s2">object out of the previous stage and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.330" end="00:23:44.370" style="s2">your architecture gets more and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.670" end="00:23:46.770" style="s2">complex because this is the structure</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.370" end="00:23:50.809" style="s2">that the society offers at the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.770" end="00:23:56.010" style="s2">level and then because that still hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.809" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">fixed this one problem that produces</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.010" end="00:24:01.590" style="s2">developmental tension to move even into</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:04.740" style="s2">even more complexity so there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.590" end="00:24:08.160" style="s2">in which one could argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.740" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2">architecture of the human organism the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.160" end="00:24:14.750" style="s2">human cognitive development ego</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:20.840" style="s2">meaning-making is a complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.750" end="00:24:20.840" style="s2">system a cognitively adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.650" end="00:24:27.140" style="s2">that whose strategy is to make meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.330" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">that seems coherent but this development</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.790" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">can&#39;t solve existential problems and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">essential problems are more embodied</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.790" end="00:24:50.580" style="s2">more evolutionary they don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:56.850" style="s2">follow developmental systems but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.580" end="00:24:59.490" style="s2">more like emergent types of processes</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.850" end="00:25:01.890" style="s2">and the emergent processes and they all</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.490" end="00:25:05.700" style="s2">depends upon the ability to insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.890" end="00:25:09.720" style="s2">these deeper structures and shift them</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:13.110" style="s2">and this is where you see complete</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.720" end="00:25:17.460" style="s2">transformation in the individual and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.110" end="00:25:20.390" style="s2">oftentimes in many cases this shift this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.460" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">that changes this existential problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.390" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">gets people off the spiral of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:33.480" style="s2">complexity and what you see is you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:36.299" style="s2">simplicity on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.480" end="00:25:38.220" style="s2">complexity so you seize things you start</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.299" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">to use words like wisdom rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.220" end="00:25:45.419" style="s2">knowledge building so for me that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:48.750" style="s2">a little overview of this conversation</p>
