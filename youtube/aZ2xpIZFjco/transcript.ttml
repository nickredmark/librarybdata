<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2">having a lot of exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.079" end="00:00:54.640" style="s2">about uh psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2">and how to arrange them</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">and sort of take ownership and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">a sense of agency around our</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">to psychotechnologies and i suggested</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">the term uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">bespoke psychotechnology which he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">a really big fan of but my jazzy</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">proclivity for titles</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">one out and that one so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:18.560" style="s2">agree on you okay yeah and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">the idea it&#39;s not only the idea of kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:23.600" style="s2">of rearranging like having a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">uh psycho technology stack um like you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.600" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">know meditation followed by breath work</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">or whatever but also a way to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">take little parts of it and create your</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">own um so maybe this is a meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">psychotechnology that we can uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">eventually have at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">and so this is going to be a starting</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">conversation of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:42.880" style="s2">so christian is going to it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">very interactive session uh he&#39;ll he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">give the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">agenda in a moment uh so i&#39;ll hand it</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">to do some closing announcements</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">but that being said i think that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">everything um</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">there&#39;s components so we&#39;re gonna record</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">the whole thing and i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">how active their participation is so but</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">happy to be here excited to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">something i&#39;ve been thinking about for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">uh as i was getting closer as we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">getting closer to being here</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">i was thinking about collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">presencing</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">and how much i love</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">the way that that psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">creates a group</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">feel so i was thinking about adding a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">little bit of that into this session</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">um so what i&#39;m going to do is i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">to first give like a brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">overview of like what i plan on talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to take a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">minutes to just sink in and be present</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna do like a round of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">sharing or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">uh but if something does feel alive for</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">you you could put it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">um and also it could be a time to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">of any questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">you have anything that that just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">comes to mind about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">the ideas i&#39;m going to give the brief</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">overview of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">and then we could start if any questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">come up we could kind of use that as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">starting place to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">i had a whole like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">almost an hour worth of stuff to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">about but i i was thinking it&#39;d be nicer</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">at the group level and let that guide</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">uh but if no questions come up i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">kind of dive right in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">so the basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">bespoke psycho technology my</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">my runners-up terms were psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">stacking which peter explained was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">not cool and i agree and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">also modular psychotech which i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">appeals to me as a musician</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">and a kind of a nerdy title</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">but whatever you want to call it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">basic idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">understand psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">um in a way that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">you can break them down and know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">they work rather than just see them as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">this solid</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">you know uh instruction book given to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">you from</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">uh someone some tradition some teacher</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">whatever uh and the reason the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">well the reason i have found that to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">so helpful is because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve had a lot of troubles trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">practice different psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">meditation or working with psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">um really anything even like collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">presencing or holotropic breath work</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">so the idea is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">all the constituent aspects of any</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">so that then you can kind of get your</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">fingers in there and know how you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">change it alter it modify it and then to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">yourself um at a in a way that relates</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">to psychotechnology so you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">where you might be bumping up against</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">difficulties with the psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">or know</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">what you want to get out of it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">you&#39;re not quite getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">um and that can one help you tweak the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">tech and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">give you an idea of oh you know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">maybe this technology isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">really what i need to be focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">and understanding the kind of theory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">psychotech might help point you to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">technology or you might understand oh i</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">need to like kind of bring in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">another psychotech that&#39;ll help to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">regulate some aspect of my practice so</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">that it actually works the way i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">work</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">i&#39;d like to uh just take the couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">minutes of silence first</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">yeah i hope that was a nice</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">couple minutes to sink in and uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">yeah if there&#39;s any questions peter that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">are already coming up</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">yeah so um sammy did you want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">you cannot meet yourself hello</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">hey hey christian so my question was</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve been interested in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">practices for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">and they all resonate with me but at</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">what is the motivation to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">have them grouped under one concept like</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">how does that serve us</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">to have an umbrella term</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">um well</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.839" style="s2">i suppose the term specifically</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">psychotechnology i find helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.839" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">because when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">if we were to use like the umbrella term</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">like meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">that limits a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">practices which might be useful to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">combine with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">so it could be really useful to combine</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">say something like qigong</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">or yoga or um</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">well just about just about anything that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">intention of affecting your own</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">psyche mixed in with something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">prayer or like a group collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">so the idea is to create like a space</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">where you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">see a bunch of different practices that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">have like pretty meaningful interactions</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">yes yes and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">that the mixing of practices people have</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">done it in their own ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">in you can see how yoga or meditation</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">has branched out</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:58.640" style="s2">okay and that makes sense now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">yeah already have a an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.640" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">practices so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">anything else peter</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">uh so uh christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">uh you get a question or statement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">so did nick if you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">christian first then nick</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">we can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">nope um maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll take a nick first and then while</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">you work on your audio issues christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">can i be heard yeah you can hear me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">hey there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll get into this as you as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">um do your presentation but i was</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">i keep wondering because there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">you know floating around</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know any of them that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">i suppose collective presencing the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">but i keep wondering are they all uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">sitting under something higher that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">like a meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">psycho technology or a series of really</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">things that you could use in almost any</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">circumstance under almost any conditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">to tackle almost any kind of question</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">or is it more important not to think</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">like that and to be like no no you need</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">the right tool for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve got a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">everything looks like a nail you need</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">the right tool for the right job</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">like that i know where&#39;s the level</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">between those two</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">you&#39;re asking if</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">the idea is to create like such a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">powerful psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">that it can be used for anything or to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">have an idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">collection of psychotechs where you find</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">the appropriate tech for the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">situation and desired outcome</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">are you asking like which am i trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">uh i was more of a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">question i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">asked earlier which is do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something that sits above all</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">these psycho technologies this</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">like a fundamental thing or or or not</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">is it more like no no there&#39;s no need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">think about that yeah all you want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">think about is the individual pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">how they apply to different situations</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">well i think the two go hand in hand if</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">i&#39;m understanding your correction</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">correctly and the first thing i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">to go into is what i&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">embodied metaphysics and i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">say that you might unders you might say</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">it underlies</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">psychotech more than sits above but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;ll be like a foundational</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">framework for how to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">understand yourself and so that way you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">can know</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">how to like you know circuit board this</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">technology for this</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">yeah so yeah we&#39;ll go into that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">christian did you get your uh audio</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">figured out no sorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">uh you want to read it peter yeah read</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">on his behalf um</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">my sense is that psychotechnologies are</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">being promoted in a capitalistic society</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">as individual practice what is your</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">interest in having psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">for groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">what are you selling us chris christian</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">um i like psycho technologies for groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">and i like for instance collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">presencing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">i am definitely interested in more of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">that i&#39;m not here to sell</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">anyone on that idea but i would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">thrilled if um the kind of concepts i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">going over were to lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">development of more group</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">psychotechnology practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">um i do</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">in regard to like how psychotechs</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">meet with capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">uh i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">well i guess here&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">i want to share this in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">a lot of times psychotechnology is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">presented</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">in the western world in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just generally trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">self-improve or something like really</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">uh vague like i want more peace or um</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">i have too many inner thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">and you just kind of have this like idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">of what it&#39;s supposed to get you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">and then here&#39;s the practice with your</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">instructions and like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">just you know follow the instructions so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">you can get the the correct output right</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">and i would say that like going into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">uh the deeper philosophy of a psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">is to explore at least impart your</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">motivations for</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">doing it in the first place like what am</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">i really trying to get to like i say i</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">want like</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">more peace but what does that mean in an</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">embodied sense like</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">what&#39;s what exactly is going on within</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">me that doesn&#39;t feel peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">right um and when things are delivered</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">in a more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">capitalist way they&#39;re trying to sell</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">you on it and so you just kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">stuck i think sometimes with like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">or maybe the tradition is selling you on</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">enlightenment or salvation</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">or healing or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">and so by like breaking things down a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">bit i think it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">it can be helpful to bring it home in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">like a really deep and personal way</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">rather than trying to fit yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">a narrative of what the psychotech is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">yeah i hope that answers that question a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">bit and i&#39;ll add something to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.079" style="s2">from kind of like the stewarding the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">stoic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.079" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">um one thing first of all just comment</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">on the capitalistic co-opting</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">of psychotech like the whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">mindfulness phenomenon where you take my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.959" style="s2">mindfulness meditation or meditation to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">sort of you know make you be a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.959" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">productive worker or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">and then like the whole they co-op</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">stoicism too i call it serenity bucks</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">um or you know you take stored</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">principles to be better</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">that&#39;s more successful at things</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">criticism for this as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">um but i really like this idea of taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">ownership of the psychotechnology and in</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">creation creating it</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">because i think there&#39;s a default uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">expectation people have like oh where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">the perfect system just give it to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">and then you&#39;re not only just taking the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">system or the practices but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">taking the ideology that&#39;s attached to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">by taking ownership of developing</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">practices you do what christian says</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">examine your own motives and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">ideologies that are attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">yeah very well put um</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">i think there&#39;s uh a lot to be there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">lot of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">in especially the older traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">like for instance you brought up yoga um</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">uh i forget the name sami you know i</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">like how you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">the hindu traditions there&#39;s uh the yoga</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">traditions meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">and different forms of meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">yoga ashram setting stuff like this it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">all kind of came together and it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">considering</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">why they put all those things together</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">i think that would be the wise thing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">do but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">take it all</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">as presented um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">okay so we have a bunch of we have two</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">other questions maybe three uh do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">wanna</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">feel them now or yeah i&#39;d love to okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">so this is let&#39;s uh um let&#39;s go in order</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">him you got a question</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">okay yeah um thanks for this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:42.120" style="s2">christian and peter um</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">i just i mean the the term</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.120" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">psychotechnologies you know 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">we&#39;d be going to what</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">and and yet as you said you know yoga</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">existed</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">has existed for a long time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">lot of things that have existed</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">but somehow it&#39;s feeling more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">um like there&#39;s some movement in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">whole notion which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">why we actually come up with a frame</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">that&#39;s called psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">that uh like together they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">into reaching together there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">um interaction and so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">like do you see that that there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">interactions between what we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">calling psychotechnologies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">and i also would say there&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">um and is there a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">of them uh collectivizing or</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">forming um you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.120" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">moving in some new direction</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">without overreaching that that may be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">big question</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">uh but i kind of like that futuristic</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">thinking yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it would be i</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">almost want to say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">self-evident that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">the the rising popularity of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">is indica uh indicative of um</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">you know the path of humanity itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">and us like being together in different</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">um and i do see a lot of already</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">of combining and mixing and matching and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">different psychotechnologies influencing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">each other basically i think it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">you said at the beginning there</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">um and i will when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">start going into some of my like</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">personal stories uh and experiences i</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">can speak to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">where i&#39;ve discovered mixed up</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">psychotechnologies in the wild</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">but yeah i think and it&#39;s hard to know</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">sometimes too</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">like someone can just say like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">the psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">and it seems like its own thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">have no idea like what influenced it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">like what practices had</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">that person or that group of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">already been doing which led to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">emergence of some new psychotic right</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">so yeah i mean i think i can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">like known examples of it and i often</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">presume</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">and sometimes guess at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">roots of different psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">how they were influenced by other psycho</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">yeah thank you for that question</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll go into that more a bit too as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">get further along</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">all right uh evan you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">um sorry for the length so um my</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">my question is this so in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">traditions which have very rich veins of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">psychotech to mind for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">vajrayana there&#39;s a sense which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">mentioned here on the stowa on evolving</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">ground of there being both a method</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">and a view and without the matching view</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">the method may be useless or worse so</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">this can</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">create some difficulties with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">of remixing or repurposing psychotics</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">from these traditions without adequate</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">consideration for the compel</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">compatibility of their respective views</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">and i&#39;m especially concerned about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">sort of thing in light of the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">traditions often have embedded within</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">them non-obvious wisdom which may not be</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">explicitly stated but which is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">to the way that practices are</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">traditionally transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">so say the ecosystem of psychotics</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">within vajrayana may be mutually</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">supportive one may serve as a bomb to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">soothe the rawness left by another for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">example and we could also mention slate</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">star codex or sarah constantine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">thoughts about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">implicit wisdom and tradition so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">also has implications for psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">where the method may be something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">take psychedelics with good people in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">good setting but the view required to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">actually manifest these positive</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">experiences consistently is much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">difficult to pen down</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">so people taking the method without</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">being inculcated in the view can have</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">frankly disastrous results so</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">i just wanted to hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">about developing an intuition for which</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">psychotechs are</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">safe or effective when decontextualized</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">from the traditions in which they arose</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">and which ones can be more or less</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">lifted as independent modular units and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">repurposed without so many issues as</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">well as anything else this question</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">brings up for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">thank you yeah wow that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">um and a really big one</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a like uh i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">there is really like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">a rule book on how to navigate that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">um but the kind of basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">principles i&#39;ve had and you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">my my background in understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:18.280" style="s2">is having</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">practices presented to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.280" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">decontextualized</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">and then going and researching and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">finding proper context</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">um and that yeah makes can make all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">so when it comes to like kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">out there on your own and like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">mess around with stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">i would say do it with a lot of caution</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">and this will be something i speak about</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">more but</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">you know there because things can get</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">hairy</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">and difficult um i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">part of one of the major principles in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">messing around it&#39;s kind of like being a</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">hacker you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">um you don&#39;t want to just start</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">around with code because you can break</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">your laptop out and won&#39;t turn on again</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">you know so when it comes to any type of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">of mixing and matching especially when</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">taking something decontextualized from</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">the tradition especially if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">somatic thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">psychedelics um real body oriented stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">you&#39;re it it can be you can be touching</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">parts of yourself that you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">understanding very well and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">very powerful and it can have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">a momentum to it that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">necessarily know how to put the brakes</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s really good to go slowly i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">new where there&#39;s not a lot of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">uh like contextual wisdom around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">um and so what i&#39;ll be presenting is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">not like hey isn&#39;t it like cool to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">you know be a mad scientist</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">um with things but kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">understanding the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">philosophy of psychotechnology so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">can understand like when something</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">might need more context um or or the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">consequences of removing something from</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">this context</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">but also um knowing when the given</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">like view per se might not really jive</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">um and like okay maybe i need to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">take this but</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">you know i want to take this view as</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">what&#39;s a wise way to do that so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole complicated messy world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">uh we&#39;re just like i&#39;m just like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">newbie</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">in it as much as anyone else except that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">thought about it a lot over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">years and it&#39;s just because i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">running into so much trouble</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">um and and yeah like messy messy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">can happen with psycho technology so</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">really good question um and i hope that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">what i present here</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">is going to help people not you know get</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">into hairy situations rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">lead them into you know the wild where</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get up</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">basically i have um</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">a thought for you christian um that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">piggy backs off evan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">uh comment uh samuel berger has this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">good term i like called the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">dark matter so it&#39;s like all the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">intellectual architecture</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">that is not explicitly known by people</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">who have a certain body of knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say there&#39;s a certain tradition</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">that has an ecology of practices and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">certain view that supports that college</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">there could be so much stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">there that they&#39;re not even aware of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">explicitly that gets lost in translation</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">if you take it from their tradition</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">um so what i&#39;m saying is when we mix and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">matching it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">i sense there&#39;s caution to even like</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">look at their views and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">take their views uh with the practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">um because there&#39;s so much going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">there that they might not even be</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.400" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">consciously aware of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m curious if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">uh i agree and i think um and and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">is also something i&#39;ll go into a bit is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">views and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">you know they&#39;re colored by culture and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">um they&#39;re limited you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">i like the term reality tunnel it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">tunnel and it&#39;s it&#39;s a proper term</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">because a tunnel is limited</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like dark space dark matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s no like one single</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">comprehensive view that&#39;s going to cover</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">everything it&#39;s just the nature of view</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">like you can share a view</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">and like you can kind of you know i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">try to embody the view that&#39;s presented</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">to me by someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">even if i try to follow it to a t it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">different view the second i take it in</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">as my own because it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">colored by my understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">and my blind spots and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">so yeah i think i think it&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">have a good sense of theory when</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.039" style="s2">approaching views</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">as well as which they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.039" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">um but yeah to have a sense of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">that all views have their limitations</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">um and keep that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.559" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">well try to identify what they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">and keep that in mind as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">exploring the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">through that view because people get</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">stuck in their view all the time and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">can be very problematic either for</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">or maybe not for themselves it might put</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">them in a very nice spot</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">and cause problems for other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">yeah all right um you want to keep going</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">some more questions uh yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">stop after like oh it&#39;s already 3 30.</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">um i&#39;ll get into the thing now and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">hopefully</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">down to stick around for like a post</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">sense making session if other people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t want to rush through the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">presentation either</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">i would say just like try to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">ideas because it might</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">present itself as like a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">scaffolding later</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">and if it&#39;s stuff that you&#39;re like super</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">super familiar with um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">redundant</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">uh i apologize but we&#39;re gonna get into</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">a little graphic visualization that i</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">drew up</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">okay everyone can see that right</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">great so</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.840" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">what what we&#39;re looking at is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">a a conceptual uh visualization</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">of what i was uh saying earlier i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">embodied metaphysics so we&#39;re like going</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">to touch</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">on basic philosophy um and then slowly</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">move that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">into something more like experiential</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">relate to and ground a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">so the first thing to notice uh in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">is the dual the dualistic aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">essence and emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">those terms come from um</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">taoism but if you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">talking to plato he would call it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">um emptiness would be korra</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">which is like the receptacle of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">and essence would be like idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s another there&#39;s like a greek</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">word for it but it can be like idea or</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">form um</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">and to try to like ground these notions</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">a bit in something that might feel a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">more intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">you can think of emptiness like</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">and this is like no metaphor really gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the nature of of like um</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">trying to get non-dual about dualism but</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">emptiness can kind of be thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">like a canvas</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">it&#39;s the blank space which allows for</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">form to arise you could say</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">very imperfect metaphor but um</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">and you can get this a little closer to</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">home by thinking about awareness itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">so we like having a sense of i whom who</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">is aware</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">and then all of this which i am aware of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">but what is the nature of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">one way you could talk about that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">emptiness it&#39;s just like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">this empty whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">in which form is appearing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">so if like emptiness seems like super</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">esoteric and that&#39;s not the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">talk about emptiness but i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">a very helpful way to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">and i kind of thought that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">like intuitive but i was talking to my</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">sister about this the other day and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">was like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">you know how like you&#39;re just aware of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">everything and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:15.240" style="s2">well sometimes i&#39;m aware i was like no</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">like i don&#39;t mean like</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">conscientious or something like that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">mean like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">aware there&#39;s there&#39;s awareness</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">and she&#39;s kind of scratching her head</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">about it uh so</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">if you don&#39;t like kind of get this sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">of this field this like empty field of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s something to like you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">investigate a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">bit just it&#39;s not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">it can almost be felt or imputed or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s an emptiness to reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not an external emptiness i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">talking about dark space i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">about like the emptiness of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">um on the other side we have essence</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s form um there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">ways to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">as well you could think about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">very idealistic way</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">like i impute form onto everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">or you could talk about it in a more</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">energetic way which would be like a more</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">realistic materialist way like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">vibrational nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">of reality however you want to think</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">about it there&#39;s like a bajillion</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">ways to you know start slicing things up</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">but i think an intuitive way is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">is energy you know like i just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">the beingness</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like active it&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a good place to to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">because this idea of energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">and form and the idea of awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">or plato&#39;s quora</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">are key concepts in a lot of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">you&#39;re working with your body you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">working with energy or you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">with awareness you&#39;re trying to get you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">even with stoicism you&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">view from above i think that really</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">points to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">having a bigger space of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">relaxing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">back more into an empty space so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">you can see</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">more of the picture without getting like</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">caught up</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">in the ideas you know you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">emptying yourself of your attachments to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">um it&#39;s something that some people call</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">observer consciousness if you get like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">really deep into it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">but i&#39;m already starting to like get</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">really uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">personal about it but abstractly we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">say emptiness in essence</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">as plato says there&#39;s like when you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">two a third is implied</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">and in the context of this visualization</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">we could say that the can you guys see</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">my my mouse cursor</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">yeah okay we could say that the third</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">is this line um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">the the border between emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">essence this is totally conceptual let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">keep this in mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">uh so we&#39;re it&#39;s all metaphor to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">certain extent but</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;re getting somewhere with it so this</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">is the meeting place of emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">essence it has properties of both</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">emptiness and essence</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">so it has a form like it even if it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">a straight line</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">that would be an integral aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">it is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">a straight line or in this case like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">textured wavy line</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">it has an aspect of form to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s also empty and that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">infinite quality to it so like this line</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s cut by our computer monitor but</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">idealistically it just goes on forever</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">contain it so in that sense it&#39;s empty</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">of form so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">both at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s the the third thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">can call it different things</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">um i&#39;m not going to name it right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">because i i don&#39;t think it would be very</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">helpful but it&#39;s important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">this third that naturally arises from</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">the two or</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t even want to say arises i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just there you know they all three</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">colorize together</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">but because we need to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">things to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">talk um what we&#39;re going to do is try to</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">find the most elegant way</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">to talk about uh this third and that i</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">would say is to make this</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">circle so this circle</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">is a conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">of something so i&#39;m i&#39;m putting a box</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">around an arbitrary part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">the this dualistic reality and this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">an idea or i would call it like a soul</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">although it kind of just it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">matter too much what you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">it&#39;s just like kind of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">particles um of this metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">and what yes so what we&#39;ve done there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.760" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve taken like</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">the infinitude of emptiness and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">unknowableness of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">essence and and the uh that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">um the heart of those two that third and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">bring concept into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">and once we do that we&#39;ve got um</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">a few ways we can define this circle</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">like to bring it more into language</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">and here i&#39;ll start talking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">about views</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">so in a more taoist view</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve got an energetic base for things</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">like in china you&#39;re more likely to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">people in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">out in the park doing some like tai chi</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">and qigong</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">before they&#39;re like sipping their coffee</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">or their tea and reading the newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">like we do in the west</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">and at an energetic level</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">you&#39;re working with transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">energy energy is just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">changing itself it&#39;s transforming from</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">this form to another</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">so if we&#39;re working in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">bottom-up definition</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be defining this concept</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">are the modes of transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">and we have three that define this</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">circle so we have this bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">this middle line and this top line</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">where one form of energy gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">transformed to another gets transformed</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">to another gets transformed to another</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">so we have three</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">areas of transformation and you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">any i&#39;d say anything and i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">reading force landry&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">and imminent metaphysics to like do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">want to really deeply grok</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">the triadic nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">um but in this case so like with taoists</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">a lot of the the it&#39;s there&#39;s variance</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s rich but</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">a lot of the thrust of taoist practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">is the transformation of essence</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">into emptiness through the soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">so you&#39;re looking at the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">from essence into what&#39;s called chi</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">or energy which is like your life energy</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">or your prana</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">or your kundalini or whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">to call it and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">of your personal energy into</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">what they call shen which is like your</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">your spirit your kind of your selfness</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">and then you can transform that energy</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:41.119" style="s2">into emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">now a top-down way of looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">what generally would be a more western</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">is to look at things not primarily from</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">the energy perspective but from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">emptiness percep</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">perspective which is as the receptacle</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">of forms so you&#39;re looking for forms</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">primarily</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">and to define this we have four forms</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">three we&#39;ve got the form of essence or</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">the substance you might say of essence</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this half the bottom half the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">top half</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">and then the emptiness itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">and a lot of what we&#39;re doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">west is doing a downward</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">motion we are looking to from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">emptiness from a place of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:28.040" style="s2">up here being a receptacle for form</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">generating forms manipulating forms</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.040" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">conceptualizing things</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">right um it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">including ourselves so like you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">transforming ourselves we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">self-improving if</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">our project is a personal one um</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">and i would say that those forms line up</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">uh like wilbur&#39;s quadrants which i</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t studied a lot of wilbur but</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a internal personal</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">and um someone correct me maybe peter</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">if i&#39;m wrong here then there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">external personal</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">internal collective and an external</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">collective is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">language more or less right would you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:16.839" style="s2">guys say</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">yeah okay um and so a way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">well the taoists name it too it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">not like what they&#39;re trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">so they they would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">uh and essence chi</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">shen emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking at is you know okay i</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">ego up here awareness</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the emptiness uh subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">down here and then um</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">the you could just say reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">or or pure form or the collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">unconscious if you&#39;d like um</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">the the wholeness of form so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.119" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">so now we&#39;re going to start trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">move this into</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">understanding this in a more embodied</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">way and how we make sense of it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">of psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">more popular thing to look at is over</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">here and these are the chakras</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">and these are if you take those four</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">quadrants conceptualize them</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">look at where they uh touch up against</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your seven chakras you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">the crown</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">chakra you&#39;ve got your third eye you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">got your throat you&#39;ve got your heart</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your solar plexus sacral</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">and root and those</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">can all be really i&#39;d say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">in terms of this fundamental metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">if you understand if you got into it</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">which we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">like what the ego is how does the ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">relate to awareness</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">knowingness how does the ego relate to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">the subconscious the heart</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not too hard and this is just my</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">personal view</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">to make sense of the chakras in that way</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">but what we&#39;re going to look at is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">the um the tripart soul if i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">that right</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">or the dantiens in taoism so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">to conceptualize these three</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">transformational centers and the very</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">common way to do that is to say the head</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">the heart and the gut or the hara</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">so this</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">basic schema is like everywhere i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">even if you haven&#39;t necessarily been</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">exposed to some philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">mentions them uh but you&#39;ll find it like</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">i said</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">plato um traditional chinese</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">philosophy there&#39;s like a 17th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">irish druidic poem called the cauldrons</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">of poesie</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">and they named them the paul the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.599" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">cauldron of warmth</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">the cauldron of movement the cauldron of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">uh there&#39;s the triads in kashmir</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">shaivism</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of more speaking to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">not so much embodied but you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">it into the embodied realm very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">um but what we kind of like commonly</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">would think of is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.079" end="00:48:22.640" style="s2">head heart gut and there&#39;s a dif</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a few different ways to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.640" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">sense of that and a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">intuitive like we all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">know what we mean when we say someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">like really in their head</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">or like i&#39;m feeling really centered in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">my heart or this person really speaks</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">directly from their heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2">or when you say someone&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">got a good gut instinct about things or</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">they speak with</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">like uh from their guts you know um</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">but how can we make sense of that in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">that can be useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">the in the context of taoism you would</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.839" style="s2">have the transformation of energy</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">as the main way you&#39;re making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.839" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">so for instance the gut there is like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">transformer</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">of the collective energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">into personal energy into your chi</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">so that could be anything from just</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">feeding yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">um keeping your cellular body alive</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">or the more subtle energy bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">doing different practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">which result in higher amounts of qi</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">which if you&#39;re not very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">qi you can talk about it different ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">most commonly it&#39;s described as like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">kind of felt</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">vibrational energy in the body</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">so then at the heart level you&#39;ve got qi</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">being transformed into shen or spirit</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">and you can think about this as working</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">the energy you already have in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">and and making it personal in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">meaning so we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">um just our kind of like raw</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">life force and that&#39;s shaped</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">evolutionarily of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">and we can really talk about um how</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">you know evolution has made us you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">social beings</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">so to speak um but in a conceptual way</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">we can say it&#39;s us taking our life force</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">and learning and transforming it into</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">a person our actions</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">our feelings our our thoughts our</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">relations with others</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">um because we&#39;re not just like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">a web of vibrations right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">the self as a concept like a self as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">unit as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">um personal me and you right</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what the hearts doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s talking between</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">this self-hood that we know</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">and this more like energetic essential</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">self-hood</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">which simply is a more somatic self</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">which we can talk about again either</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">like in scientific terms the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">system all the brain all of that or more</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">subtle terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">energy systems kundalini and all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">and then you have the head and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">taking</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">our personal sense of self um</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">and well</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">so if we say that this is emptiness is</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">kind of like awareness</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">or we could say that awareness is what</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">happens when you have a self</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">touching up against a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">you have the ability for a person to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">have an experience right</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">awareness how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">i&#39;m everyone likes to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">or at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">a lot of people do the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">um but we can talk about it in like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">easy way which is like you know just be</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">more aware</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">get a little more headspace right slow</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">take a a view from above</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">and there&#39;s so many practices which we</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">could name that do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s the basics and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">i want to stop now if peter if you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">any like really good</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:23.040" style="s2">clarification type questions in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.680" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.040" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">um maybe something i&#39;ve said isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.680" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">really landing well</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">not so much i don&#39;t want to use too much</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">time to like kind of go down rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">holes right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">but if there&#39;s anything that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">really needs clarifying and what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">gone over so far</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">i&#39;m happy to answer some questions take</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">a quick</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">break for people to put some in as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">nothing&#39;s in the chest right now but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">can give it a few moments if you like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll give it like 20 seconds or</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">it took a little longer than i wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">to but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">uh my penchant for</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">rambling which i enjoy somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">uh robert has his hand raised</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">um okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">well feel free to unmute okay there we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">so uh you were talking about view</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">and um there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">the path and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">the llamas talk about in and there seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">to be a place where</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">the view is something you have when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a story you tell yourself about our</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">experience or what we&#39;re trying what</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get to or</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">where we are and the path is that thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">we do</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">to get there but the llamas talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">it and the zen people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">about there gets to be a place where the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">path and the view are</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">the same there is no difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">having a view there&#39;s just a path</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">whatever it is it needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">next that&#39;s pretty neat</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">yeah and and think</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">robert&#39;s a friend of mine uh we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">like three hour long phone conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">so i was like this question could last a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">long time we&#39;re gonna find out</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">how big of a an area of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve just opened up</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">but yeah and i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">that difference between the path and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">view is a difference of bottom up and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">down so for instance we can talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">but we can also ask where did a view</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">come from you know like</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">view is going to be transmitted to us</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">through language and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">we have to start breaking down language</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">we have to start breaking down culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">we have to start getting into evolution</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">and break that down into energy and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">we can say</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">that like the path and the view are like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">we can break them up and separate them</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">but we can also say that they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">intertwined in a way that&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">um and a lot of like psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">uh might be presented in this like very</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">discreet way</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">and you want to like get the view right</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">you want to get the the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">you have to ask like where where did</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">they come from like why did someone</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">start like</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">twisting their body in weird ways like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">in yoga i believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s said that a lot of it was from</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">like imitating</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">animals i don&#39;t know um maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">just an intuitive thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">it just started happening that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">come from a view</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">before there was a view about how to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">yoga properly or how to think about life</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">there were people who were just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">or experimenting or conditions impressed</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">themselves upon them such that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">thoughts arose new ideas arose new</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">actions arose</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">and once they arise once you can start</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">they become possibly memes and can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">um but yeah the path and the view are</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:17.119" style="s2">just two conceptual ways of talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">about this one thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.119" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">but they&#39;re useful separations of how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">yeah um so we&#39;ve got 30 minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to to tell a few stories about</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">my my journey</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">of psycho technologies now i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">try to keep it down to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">about 10 minutes which is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:39.119" style="s2">really hard because i like to tell</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.119" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">um but we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna do our</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">the technically the i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">first psycho technology i ever engaged</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">was accidental it would have been when i</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">was 19</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">just out of high school i had</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">an hour and 45 minute bus ride</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">each way to my job</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">and uh i&#39;m 35 now so this was you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">16 17 years ago 16 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t have an iphone i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">bringing books or game boys or anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">like that i was just sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">and well if i could i would just fall</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">asleep</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">which is kind of its own psycho</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">technology to try to sleep on a public</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">bus</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">but a useful one actually and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">mention this um</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:35.440" style="s2">i would try to sleep on the bus but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to miss my stop</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.440" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">and so i would try to get into this like</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">half asleep</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">state of mind where i was relaxed as</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">possible but i still had like a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">antenna up</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">that would like listen for cues and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">hear the bus stops being named and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">i was trying to get as relaxed as i</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">could without falling asleep</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">and little did i know that that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">big element of a lot of meditations</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">is getting this very relaxed place</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">um so i was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">um i was also running to catch the bus</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:08.640" style="s2">in the mornings</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:10.240" style="s2">like i had to sprint there because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.640" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">you know waking up super late</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m starting my day off with like</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">exercise which you can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">usually get me to exercise unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">something fun like playing</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">tennis or going hiking but as it were i</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">was starting each day with like a sprint</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">for like 10 minutes and then this like</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">deep relaxation</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">and then i&#39;d have the rest of my uh my</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">drive to work and then on my way back</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">just to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">to think about things and so i was</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what the good like um</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">like socratic terminology would be for</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">this or</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">but basically having a deep inner</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">and thinking things over very deeply i</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">was moved to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">consider all of my discontents with my</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">and break them down so deeply that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">could present an argument</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">about why they were wrong that was like</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">totally impenetrable</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">and i was able to like imagine that my</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">parents were</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">quite a bit more intelligent than they</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">were so i was having to refine my</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.799" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">my arguments deeper and deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">really break things down</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:22.400" style="s2">into their essence and i was touching</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">upon</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">a lot of like basic philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:27.920" style="s2">notions</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">contemplative spiritual notions about</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.920" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">about ignorance and blind spots and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">and holding making space for that every</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">day looking at it from different angles</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">and over the course of a month of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">one day it just like kind of flipped</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">around on me</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">and i was like okay if i&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">really true to what i&#39;m saying here it</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to hold any</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">resentment towards my parents</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">and where it does make sense to put that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">energy is upon myself like to live by</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">these principles which</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve investigated deeply and feel very</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">alive for me</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.000" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">and it was really like and uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">almost like a physical transformation</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">happened where suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">like the energy started flowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">differently and it felt like my chest</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:19.280" style="s2">like opened up</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">a bit and like just kind of like water</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">was like pouring out of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">i felt very empowered i felt um</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">happy peaceful and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">spent the rest of my bus trips you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:33.760" style="s2">thinking further</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">deepening into that um</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">and that led to great experiences like</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">learning to like pass on</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.760" style="s2">negative thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">i would start to feel them arising which</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.760" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">like unformed just like a habit of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">wanting to like complain about</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.640" style="s2"> and before it would turn into a</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">thought i would like let go</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">and it would just turn into gratitude i</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">was like very happy to be alive</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">and i felt very connected to other</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">people i could sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">within everyone else this like same</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">basic desire to want to be happy and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">so it was great i was like you know very</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">happy</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">um for for quite a while and then i got</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">into a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">and it all went like just like a sinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">ship</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">it just went away because trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">embody that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">in a relationship i had no no context</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">for doing it i suppressed a lot of my</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">intuitions</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">um in service of trying to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">relationship going</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">like holding my tongue about this or</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">that where i wanted to like</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">you know have conversations about stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">that would come up for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.000" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">and so from there i would say to</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">maybe five years ago like understanding</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">myself at an emotional level has been</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">my work and been in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">i made art for a long time wrote a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">of songs</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">write poetry and just was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">my feelings and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">increasing my capacity to embody those</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">feelings understanding where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.319" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">eventually got into some psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">and you know tracing things down and all</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">but didn&#39;t really do any formal</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:17.839" style="s2">meditation practices</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">uh except right after i broke up</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.839" end="01:02:21.920" style="s2">in that relationship um i tried to</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">meditate</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">i read a book called magic and mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">in tibet by alexander david neal</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">and that turned me on to the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">like spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know what the i was doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:34.559" style="s2">but i was like all right it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">about breathing and exhales are longer</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.559" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">than the outhail</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">um the inhale so i went in my closet</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">every day and it would just sit there</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">and try to like manipulate my breath</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">which didn&#39;t do much i just get</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">distracted by like hypnagogic colors and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">and then one day i&#39;m meditating and i</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">just start to feel this like little</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">tightness in the center of my chest and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">it starts to like expand</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:00.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s just this like arid tight</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.559" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">feeling of like my chest my heart</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.640" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">turning into a desert</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very painful i&#39;m like this sucks</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:07.119" style="s2">what the so i just stopped</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">meditating because i was like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.119" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">know what i&#39;m doing i&#39;m gonna like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">screw myself up so i didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">meditate</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">um for i&#39;d say about</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">10 years after that again i was just</p>

<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">own psycho technology for sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:28.839" style="s2">um but don&#39;t have time to talk about all</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.839" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">uh as i was getting more into psychology</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">jungian spirituality um</p>

<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">but it would bring up um a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.839" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">um i noticed that on my exhales there</p>

<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:35.760" style="s2">it to it um so it&#39;s like a really</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">complex thing to really consider</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.760" end="01:05:40.640" style="s2">all the variables in what constitutes a</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not limited to just what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">in your head or in your body</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">um so anyways i get back to the united</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:56.160" style="s2">um i&#39;m in texas</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:58.000" style="s2">and to record an album and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">start trying to continue my meditation</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.000" end="01:06:02.839" style="s2">practice and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">i&#39;m getting like floods of overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.839" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:08.000" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know what it is i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">what it means where it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.000" end="01:06:12.799" style="s2">it just feels like a sea of feelings</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">that i might drown in</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:17.119" style="s2">and so i was like i don&#39;t want to go too</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:19.280" style="s2">much deeper with this practice right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">i instinctively felt like i needed to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:22.400" style="s2">a physical practice and i&#39;d heard about</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">qigong</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.400" end="01:06:26.799" style="s2">so i just got on youtube and started</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">doing some qigong</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.599" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">and that was amazing it was like i wish</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">someone had been</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.720" end="01:06:39.280" style="s2">showing me qigong when i was like 10</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">years old and freaking out and</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">helped me to have a higher capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">for holding emotion but in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">that i started going to psychotherapy</p>

<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s really bad when you&#39;re like so high</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">that wanting to move your hand has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">three second delay before your hand</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">actually moves</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very freaky um i think i walked</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">moving too fast it just</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">made me pretty miserable um</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:51.600" style="s2">so yeah already like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">i had to learn in a hard-headed way as i</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.600" end="01:08:54.159" style="s2">often do</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">about how to be careful with</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.159" end="01:08:57.120" style="s2">psychotechnologies including</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.120" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">um but yeah be be careful especially</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">mixing psychedelics with well with</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2">to begin with but with any other</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">meditation practice because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">hard to predict</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen um psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.239" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">works so deeply</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">that you know i would say if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">going to do it at all start with like</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">mini micro doses and titrate your way</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">into more just like just the tiniest bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s really important to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">careful with those</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.199" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">anyway so now i&#39;m in la and</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">on daniel schmoktenberger&#39;s podcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">i forget what it&#39;s called the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">but</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:06.239" style="s2">and this course is um</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">designed by someone who was researching</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.239" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">enlightened states of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">um trying to understand in a really</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">practical way how you alter your</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:19.840" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">towards whatever enlightenment or</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.840" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">um rather than and kind of disregarding</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">views</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">and looking at the path as robert put it</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">like i don&#39;t care what your philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">you know yours that you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:36.560" style="s2">cell for this or that or blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">he was wanted to like very um</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.560" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">with a high level of resolution and a</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:42.719" style="s2">large sample base</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">like i think like 2 000 people get a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.719" end="01:10:49.120" style="s2">sense of like what practices</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:52.239" style="s2">work to to shift people&#39;s consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.120" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">and he came up with i think like 12</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.239" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">like gold standard practices which seem</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">to work for people</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">so in this course you you go through all</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">and you the idea is that you try to find</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">the one that like resonates with you</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">um because another thing he found in his</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">research was that</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">you can do a practice for like ever like</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">you could be practicing zazen for</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.640" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">decades 30 years and make some progress</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">not nearly the progress that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">be making</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:24.840" style="s2">or which is promised to you and someone</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">doing this will then switch to a new</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.840" end="01:11:29.920" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:33.120" style="s2">and get results very quickly so that</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.920" end="01:11:35.760" style="s2">brings us this notion of method matching</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.120" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">uh the idea that like practices are not</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.760" end="01:11:39.679" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">like hammers and nails um</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.679" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">everyone&#39;s different everyone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:46.239" style="s2">their own psychological makeup their own</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">energetic propensities and postures</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.239" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">and different technologies are going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:53.120" style="s2">work well for different people</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:55.440" style="s2">depending on who you are and and what</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.120" end="01:11:57.679" style="s2">you want out of it too</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.440" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">so that kind of opened my mind to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.679" end="01:12:01.920" style="s2">idea of of</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">you know not getting stuck on any one</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.920" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">technology for too long</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:10.080" style="s2">and in addition to doing that course i</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:14.239" style="s2">was doing a holotropic breath work class</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:15.280" style="s2">and the the instructor there</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.239" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know this because it was my</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.280" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">first introduction to breath work but he</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:21.679" style="s2">bringing in other practices with breath</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:23.040" style="s2">work he was very against mixing it with</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.679" end="01:12:25.360" style="s2">psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.040" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">um again and i thought like a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.360" end="01:12:30.000" style="s2">close-minded way but i</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">i think it&#39;s very intense to do that and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.000" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">i would never recommend it to people</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:34.719" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think you need to make a</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">rule around it</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.719" end="01:12:37.840" style="s2">but he would do things like in between</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:42.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.840" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">breathing uh sets laughter meditations</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.880" end="01:12:47.280" style="s2">or um i don&#39;t know what these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.440" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">were called at the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.280" end="01:12:51.679" style="s2">uh but things such as progressive</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.679" end="01:12:56.239" style="s2">um which is i think works really well</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">with holotropic breath work and i do</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">that regularly whenever i do breath work</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:05.040" style="s2">and then there&#39;s um the music he was</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:07.520" style="s2">playing for instance</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.040" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">uh trying to do breath work in a quiet</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.520" end="01:13:10.080" style="s2">room versus doing it in a room where</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.080" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">um really relaxing music is</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">a big difference you know as like i said</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:19.520" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">art making art but also art itself is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.520" end="01:13:23.679" style="s2">powerful psychotechnology and something</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.280" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">to consider</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.679" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">um and we did some like body relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.239" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">so anyways you know we had all these</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">different things and then i was also</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:33.760" style="s2">doing like high intensity interval</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.760" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">a bit of yoga and i was noticing</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.000" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">how all these different things the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.320" end="01:13:45.920" style="s2">meditation course i was doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:48.880" style="s2">the breath work and more just like phys</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.920" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">qi gong and yoga and um high intensity</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.880" end="01:13:51.440" style="s2">interval training</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">we&#39;re all informing each other in</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.440" end="01:13:55.280" style="s2">interesting ways i guess i was doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">like non-dualistic practices of</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.280" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">um my the experiences i was having in</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">breath work were starting to change</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">where i was like</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.640" style="s2">getting to those same places but faster</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2">and more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.640" end="01:14:12.239" style="s2">um and maybe the first instance of me</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.400" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">kind of creating my own bespoke</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.239" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">psychotech you might say</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">was one day where i had this thought pop</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:22.080" style="s2">into my head</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">which is what do my thoughts feel like</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.080" end="01:14:26.719" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.320" style="s2">i didn&#39;t really know what to do with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.719" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">but that evening i&#39;m doing my breath</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.320" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">work and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:33.280" style="s2">while we&#39;re relaxing at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:35.280" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.280" end="01:14:36.640" style="s2">i like the question pops back into my</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.280" end="01:14:40.000" style="s2">mind what do my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.640" end="01:14:41.920" style="s2">feel like and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.000" end="01:14:43.199" style="s2">i didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t know how to answer</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.920" end="01:14:43.920" style="s2">that with more thoughts that didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.199" end="01:14:47.120" style="s2">much sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.920" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">so i just started paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.120" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:52.880" style="s2">quality of my thoughts like how are they</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:54.480" style="s2">showing up in relation to the rest of my</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.880" end="01:14:56.640" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.480" end="01:14:58.159" style="s2">so i was already deeply embodied from</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.640" end="01:14:59.679" style="s2">the breath work which</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.159" end="01:15:01.440" style="s2">worked really well for me as far as</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.679" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">relaxing me letting me get into my</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.440" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:10.159" style="s2">and uh feel like my internal energy and</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:11.199" style="s2">being grounded in that um i think helped</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.159" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">me to observe</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.199" end="01:15:15.520" style="s2">my my thoughts in a way where i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:18.480" style="s2">like caught up in them so much</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.520" end="01:15:20.159" style="s2">i was kind of anchored a bit more so</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.480" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">then when i was</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.159" end="01:15:24.480" style="s2">sitting there with this this question</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.320" end="01:15:27.199" style="s2">and i was you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:29.120" style="s2">what i like i said aesthetically aware</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.199" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">of my thoughts rather than engaging with</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.120" end="01:15:34.159" style="s2">the meaning of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:36.320" style="s2">after some time all of a sudden my</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.159" end="01:15:38.960" style="s2">thoughts just stopped</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.320" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re just like gone i was like what</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.960" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:44.400" style="s2">that lasted maybe 20 seconds before i</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">got so excited i like stood up</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.400" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">in the class and was</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">like thinking about it like that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">um and it was like immediately trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:54.239" style="s2">like you know make sense of it and all</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.239" end="01:15:58.000" style="s2">um so so there was an instance where</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:00.159" style="s2">there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.000" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">psycho technologies i was practicing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.159" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">all the other ones that the instructor</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">would mix in</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">that deeply informed each other like the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:11.280" style="s2">groundedness and embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">of the breath work gave me um a capacity</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.280" end="01:16:13.360" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:15.280" style="s2">observing my thoughts in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.360" end="01:16:16.960" style="s2">non-interfering way</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.280" end="01:16:18.400" style="s2">which i&#39;d never done before and part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.960" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">it was something that just came out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.400" end="01:16:22.239" style="s2">nowhere right</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:23.280" style="s2">like that idea to to ask myself what do</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.239" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">my thoughts feel like</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.280" end="01:16:27.199" style="s2">no one ever told that to me it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">thought that popped up in my head and i</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.199" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">went with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:36.400" style="s2">so i made my own my own tech there</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:40.880" style="s2">um we got 12 more minutes</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.400" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">i i think i&#39;m going to pivot now to</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.880" end="01:16:46.560" style="s2">some some like catchy</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">easy ways to to think about all this</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.560" end="01:16:50.480" style="s2">stuff i&#39;ve just been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:51.679" style="s2">uh like little questions you can ask</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.480" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">yourself when thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.679" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.040" end="01:16:59.600" style="s2">you know that might be helpful so</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">the first i would say well first of all</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">themselves so i think we have high</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">discerning people here</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll give everyone a chance real</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:48.239" style="s2">quick if someone</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:48.239" style="s2">really wants to ask something</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:53.199" style="s2">a christian wants me to read this one uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">how do you deal with rumination or the</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.199" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">possibility of rumination</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:17:59.199" style="s2">oh like just mental rumination while</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">you&#39;re like trying to focus on your</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.199" end="01:18:04.159" style="s2">practice like getting caught up</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">in thoughts like</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">seems yes okay um</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">for me the the thing i just talked about</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:15.679" style="s2">the feeling my thoughts was the first</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">thing that really helped me with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.679" end="01:18:20.800" style="s2">um and that practice is i&#39;ll like</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">explain it a little bit but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.800" end="01:18:24.640" style="s2">something very intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">which is to try to get an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.640" end="01:18:28.800" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">to the process of thinking so normally</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.800" end="01:18:32.719" style="s2">when we think about our thoughts we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">trying to you know relate them to other</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.719" end="01:18:35.440" style="s2">thoughts basically like what do i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:37.120" style="s2">by this thought</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.440" end="01:18:38.800" style="s2">or you&#39;re just kind of following it down</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.120" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">like a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.800" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">trail right um</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">when it comes to um and you know people</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">will say like in your meditation just</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">let</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.920" end="01:18:51.840" style="s2">thoughts come and go and i never had</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.159" end="01:18:55.440" style="s2">much luck with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.840" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">uh i think the the deeply ingrained</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.440" end="01:19:01.600" style="s2">habit of following my thoughts was</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">was a big part of my my character</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.600" end="01:19:05.600" style="s2">so to um and there&#39;s different ways to</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">deal with this</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.600" end="01:19:08.800" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m just really presenting one</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:11.920" style="s2">um but this this practice was a way</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:15.600" style="s2">where i was</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.920" end="01:19:18.640" style="s2">changing my um</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.600" end="01:19:19.520" style="s2">my mode of awareness from this very</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.640" end="01:19:22.080" style="s2">mental</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.520" end="01:19:23.040" style="s2">awareness of the web of meaning in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.080" end="01:19:25.199" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.040" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">to a slightly more embodied mode of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.199" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">awareness which is aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have a lot of access to</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:32.239" style="s2">that now i would say like a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">to do would be to practice</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.239" end="01:19:38.239" style="s2">photography or or arts right um</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:39.920" style="s2">do something where all of your attention</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.239" end="01:19:41.120" style="s2">is not about the meaning of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:44.159" style="s2">looking at but like</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.120" end="01:19:47.679" style="s2">the form the colors the textures</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.159" end="01:19:49.520" style="s2">the the composition the balances um</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.679" end="01:19:51.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a more artful way to look at things</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.520" end="01:19:53.199" style="s2">and i found that by switching into that</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.679" end="01:19:55.280" style="s2">artful mode</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.199" end="01:19:56.400" style="s2">rather than my meaning making mode i was</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.280" end="01:19:59.440" style="s2">able to let</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.400" end="01:20:01.600" style="s2">rumination just kind of recede into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.440" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.600" end="01:20:04.400" style="s2">or you know sometimes it doesn&#39;t go so</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">well and you&#39;re just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.400" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">switching back and forth between</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">little spurts of getting caught in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:10.800" style="s2">thoughts and then what do my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:12.239" style="s2">feel like and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">get remember to get grounded in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.239" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">body so and that&#39;s the other thing i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.000" end="01:20:17.600" style="s2">say with rumination</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:19.280" style="s2">is to have a solid foundation in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:21.360" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.280" end="01:20:23.040" style="s2">is really really really helpful but</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.360" end="01:20:25.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge project</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.040" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">because the body is your storehouse of</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.679" end="01:20:29.840" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:33.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s all sorts of in there</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.840" end="01:20:36.400" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.520" end="01:20:37.760" style="s2">the vipassana style like gawanka style</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.400" end="01:20:40.960" style="s2">body scanning meditation</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.760" end="01:20:43.440" style="s2">for me was insanely difficult</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.960" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">uh when i first started doing it first</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.440" end="01:20:48.159" style="s2">of all rumination was like just a killer</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:50.480" style="s2">and i was just in my thoughts constantly</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.159" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">and and feeling bad about that</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.480" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">um like you know god i can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:56.000" style="s2">this and creating frustration or shame</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:57.440" style="s2">which was just creating more thoughts it</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.000" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">was gnarly</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.440" end="01:21:02.320" style="s2">um but i stuck with it and i&#39;ll use this</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:05.520" style="s2">story actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.320" end="01:21:09.040" style="s2">to seg into some of the principles</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.520" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">so when i was doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.040" end="01:21:14.239" style="s2">um goenka style body scanning</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">i starting to get these really weird</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.239" end="01:21:18.159" style="s2">tensions in my head it felt not like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">headache but more like someone had stuck</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.159" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">a magnet in my head</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">and like the field of energy was like</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">getting distorted it just it felt wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.520" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">it didn&#39;t feel good it wasn&#39;t painful</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:29.600" style="s2">but i was like this is this is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:31.199" style="s2">and there was nothing in the instruction</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.600" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">in the course that addressed that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.199" end="01:21:35.360" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t getting helpful feedback</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:37.920" style="s2">from the people who run the course</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.360" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">but i went online i like went to like</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:40.320" style="s2">reddit and some forums and and just</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">tried to</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.320" end="01:21:44.080" style="s2">you know wisely google my way into an</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:46.480" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.080" end="01:21:48.639" style="s2">that would address this phenomena and i</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.480" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">found two things</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.639" end="01:21:52.159" style="s2">uh one person was saying it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:54.239" style="s2">get into your heart more before you</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.159" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">start doing your body scanning</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.239" end="01:21:58.000" style="s2">i thought okay that sounds like a good</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">idea and then another person said hey</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.000" end="01:22:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s really good to center in your gut</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:03.760" style="s2">before you start doing body scanning</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.320" end="01:22:05.600" style="s2">and i thought okay that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.760" end="01:22:09.280" style="s2">good idea so</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.600" end="01:22:12.080" style="s2">i bespoked a little psychotec where</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.280" end="01:22:12.880" style="s2">i would when i started my practice i</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.080" end="01:22:15.679" style="s2">would take</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.880" end="01:22:16.800" style="s2">three breaths focusing on my hara area</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.679" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">the gut</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.800" end="01:22:20.639" style="s2">and i would think about relaxation i</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">would just be like you know peacefulness</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.639" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">groundedness</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">relaxed safe all of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:29.199" style="s2">and then i would take three breaths</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">where i was focusing on my heart and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.199" end="01:22:32.239" style="s2">would think like you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:34.960" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t think words so much but more</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:37.840" style="s2">just like a feeling of like positivity</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.960" end="01:22:40.320" style="s2">um connection like a it&#39;s like a green</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.840" end="01:22:42.880" style="s2">light like thumbs up like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.320" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">and then after three breaths there i</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.880" end="01:22:46.239" style="s2">would take three breaths</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:47.840" style="s2">and just move into my awareness of my</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.239" end="01:22:50.239" style="s2">body sensations</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.840" end="01:22:52.000" style="s2">and do scanning for three breaths and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.239" end="01:22:54.719" style="s2">this worked really well for me</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.000" end="01:22:55.360" style="s2">and it helped me to do the body scans</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.719" end="01:22:58.320" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.360" end="01:22:58.719" style="s2">getting so triggered because i had a lot</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.320" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.719" end="01:23:04.960" style="s2">uh somatic trauma basically and these</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:07.360" style="s2">augmenting it with these relaxing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.960" end="01:23:09.360" style="s2">heart opening exercises</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.360" end="01:23:11.120" style="s2">allowed me to do the practice in a way</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.360" end="01:23:12.320" style="s2">that was manageable</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:14.320" style="s2">and it led to some pretty deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.320" end="01:23:18.080" style="s2">experiences too</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.320" end="01:23:21.520" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t necessarily cure</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.080" end="01:23:24.880" style="s2">all those anxieties there were some like</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.520" end="01:23:28.719" style="s2">purges of you know mental</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.880" end="01:23:30.400" style="s2">um but in general it was just like a way</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.719" end="01:23:34.480" style="s2">to make the practice work</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.400" end="01:23:36.560" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s good too um</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.480" end="01:23:38.159" style="s2">sometimes you have to like just get what</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.560" end="01:23:40.239" style="s2">you can afford</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.159" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">and so you might not be able to like</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.239" end="01:23:43.280" style="s2">fully address</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:45.120" style="s2">your traumas that are showing up in your</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.280" end="01:23:46.719" style="s2">meditation practice</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.120" end="01:23:48.960" style="s2">but you might be able to do something</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.719" end="01:23:50.960" style="s2">that helps you meditate through them or</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.960" end="01:23:53.120" style="s2">you know ease them just while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:55.040" style="s2">meditating and then that meditation</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.120" end="01:23:56.000" style="s2">might like give you enough clarity that</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.040" end="01:23:58.000" style="s2">you can change your</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.000" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">life situation a bit so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.000" end="01:24:02.239" style="s2">open up some space for</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:03.600" style="s2">uh going to therapy or or whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.239" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">might do to help address</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.600" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">those deeper traumas um</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:11.280" style="s2">so with the five minutes i have left the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">four minutes i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.280" end="01:24:14.800" style="s2">try to cram in some some things really</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:17.760" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.800" end="01:24:19.679" style="s2">one is this this back to the the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.760" end="01:24:20.480" style="s2">metaphysics the head the heart and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.679" end="01:24:22.000" style="s2">gut</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.480" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">it can be helpful to think about</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.000" end="01:24:26.960" style="s2">practices um</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:29.440" style="s2">in this framework um</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.960" end="01:24:30.719" style="s2">one you can think about what energy</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.440" end="01:24:34.320" style="s2">center does a practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.719" end="01:24:35.440" style="s2">draw upon so like is it primarily like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.320" end="01:24:38.800" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.440" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">um or energetic gut oriented practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.800" end="01:24:43.840" style="s2">um is it an emotional practice where</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">you&#39;re interfacing with your heart</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.840" end="01:24:47.360" style="s2">or is it a mental practice something</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">more view oriented</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.360" end="01:24:52.239" style="s2">or contemplative or pure awareness type</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">of practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.239" end="01:24:55.840" style="s2">and then the other question is like what</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.840" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">is the purpose of the practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.840" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">what is it trying to do which energy</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.360" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">center is it working on</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.280" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">so for instance um</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:09.760" style="s2">you could have a practice like</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:11.600" style="s2">contemplative prayer right you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.760" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">you choose a word it&#39;s like a monster</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.600" end="01:25:15.280" style="s2">type of thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">you usually choose like a religiously</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.280" end="01:25:18.000" style="s2">oriented word</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:20.159" style="s2">that feels good to you when i did it i</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.000" end="01:25:23.280" style="s2">would use the word hallelujah</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.159" end="01:25:23.920" style="s2">and you you choose a word that naturally</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.280" end="01:25:26.159" style="s2">elicits</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.920" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">emotion in you right which you might not</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.159" end="01:25:28.239" style="s2">be able to find one in which case you</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.840" end="01:25:30.400" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.239" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">go to a whole nother technology to start</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.400" end="01:25:32.560" style="s2">opening up your heart and getting your</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">emotions flowing</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.560" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">but if you can find a word that like</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:38.400" style="s2">makes you feel something</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.760" style="s2">you use that as a contemplative anchor</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.400" end="01:25:41.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s called centering prayer because</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.760" end="01:25:44.000" style="s2">what it does is it centers your mind</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.679" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2">can help with the rumination so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.000" end="01:25:48.320" style="s2">centering into this heart feeling</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.320" end="01:25:49.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s a heart oriented it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.320" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">coming from the heart but what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.440" end="01:25:53.440" style="s2">doing is having an effect on your mind</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re learning to still your</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.440" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">mind and focus it and bring greater</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:26:00.080" style="s2">clarity</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.719" end="01:26:01.360" style="s2">um and awareness so that would be like</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.080" end="01:26:04.480" style="s2">in the taoist system</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.360" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">i would say um moving shen</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.480" end="01:26:08.880" style="s2">from shen to emptiness right or</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:11.679" style="s2">centeredness which is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.880" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2">they go hand in hand in some ways uh and</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.679" end="01:26:17.120" style="s2">then another thing might be like</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:17.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.840" end="01:26:21.520" style="s2">well in taoism there they have like a</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.679" end="01:26:23.040" style="s2">whole system like if you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.520" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">something there&#39;s like a procedure for</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.040" end="01:26:26.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:29.280" style="s2">i could name so many um but let&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.800" end="01:26:31.840" style="s2">look at a top-down one like</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.280" end="01:26:32.880" style="s2">uh well i&#39;m not gonna give any more</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.840" end="01:26:35.199" style="s2">examples right now</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.880" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna say one other thing in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.199" end="01:26:39.040" style="s2">last minute and a half</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:40.480" style="s2">which is set and setting which we</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.040" end="01:26:41.280" style="s2">already went over a bit well we went</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:44.000" style="s2">over setting</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.280" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">um how important setting is your</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.000" end="01:26:48.239" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:50.560" style="s2">set is mindset which is like you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.239" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on internally</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.560" end="01:26:55.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s the the situation that you find</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:56.880" style="s2">yourself within</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.040" end="01:26:58.639" style="s2">and the situation which you find within</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.880" end="01:27:00.560" style="s2">yourself and those are both</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.639" end="01:27:02.159" style="s2">going to strongly affect the practice</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.560" end="01:27:03.920" style="s2">itself including your motivations for</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.159" end="01:27:05.040" style="s2">doing it if you&#39;re dealing with traumas</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.920" end="01:27:08.480" style="s2">depressions</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.040" end="01:27:10.639" style="s2">your expectations um all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.480" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">like don&#39;t do acid when you&#39;re 19 and</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.639" end="01:27:14.000" style="s2">severely depressed and anxious because</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:14.400" style="s2">you might have like a month-long bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.000" end="01:27:16.960" style="s2">trip</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">just saying it might happen but i want</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.960" end="01:27:22.239" style="s2">to add two more things to that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:25.679" style="s2">which is sit and</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.239" end="01:27:28.719" style="s2">sitting so sit would be</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.679" end="01:27:29.280" style="s2">your body and what are you doing with</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.719" end="01:27:30.960" style="s2">your body</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.280" end="01:27:33.360" style="s2">while you&#39;re meditating are you sitting</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.960" end="01:27:35.199" style="s2">down is your body relaxed</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.360" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">are you holding tension are you laying</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.199" end="01:27:39.199" style="s2">down are you walking are you standing</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">all of these things are things to think</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.199" end="01:27:42.560" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.400" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">are you on a comfortable surface are you</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:47.520" style="s2">doing something like crazy like</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:48.719" style="s2">uh you know lotus position because</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.520" end="01:27:50.239" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do but</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.719" end="01:27:51.199" style="s2">like you&#39;re so distracted by the</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.239" end="01:27:53.120" style="s2">discomfort</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.199" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">that you can&#39;t focus on the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.120" end="01:27:56.480" style="s2">so the somatic elements</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:58.719" style="s2">how is my body right now what am i doing</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.480" end="01:28:00.400" style="s2">with my body do i need to try walking</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.719" end="01:28:01.199" style="s2">while i meditate that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.400" end="01:28:03.120" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.199" end="01:28:04.639" style="s2">and then the last thing would be sitting</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.120" end="01:28:07.040" style="s2">which is who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.639" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">sitting with you who is are you doing it</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.040" end="01:28:11.040" style="s2">by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:13.280" style="s2">might it be useful to work with a group</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.040" end="01:28:14.880" style="s2">are you doing it with someone who is</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.280" end="01:28:16.639" style="s2">inhibiting your practice because you</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.880" end="01:28:18.639" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be out of alignment with</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.639" end="01:28:21.920" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing like maybe an</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.639" end="01:28:24.080" style="s2">instructor or a guru or someone</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.920" end="01:28:26.239" style="s2">so finding other people or finding the</p>

<p begin="01:28:35.760" end="01:28:39.199" style="s2">uh these are all things to consider and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.000" end="01:28:42.639" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
