<p begin="00:00:21.539" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">that brings value to life to bring value</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:28.010" style="s2">to this world we sometimes need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.609" end="00:00:30.689" style="s2">really look at the very big picture</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.010" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">astronomy can sometimes give us some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.689" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">perspective how unique is this world to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">give you a sense of it imagine you had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">little bit of talcum powder in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:42.620" style="s2">hands and you&#39;re looking at it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing the very smallest grain</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.620" end="00:00:50.210" style="s2">you pick one you paint it red and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">gonna now do one of those little</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.210" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">contests where you&#39;re like there&#39;s a jar</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to figure out how many</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">marbles are in the jar so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">basically look at different size piles</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">and try to figure out just how unique is</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">this world so imagine this entire room</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">was filled with talcum powder and we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">one little grain of red in that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">little grain compared to an entire room</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">this entire space solid full is that how</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">unique life on Earth is nope it&#39;s bigger</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">than that imagine you&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:23.369" style="s2">mountain an enormous mountain you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.369" end="00:01:27.500" style="s2">way up and you&#39;re basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">there&#39;s this huge huge huge pile and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.500" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">only one single grain represents this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">planet it&#39;s a life that we know amongst</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">all of that is that how unique life on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">Earth is nope it&#39;s even bigger imagine</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">you&#39;re standing at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">mountain you&#39;re looking out over this</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:14.900" style="s2">the chance that if you were to just pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.960" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">up one single grain that it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.900" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">red one just think of how improbable</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:31.640" style="s2">that is we are one world out of seven</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:33.830" style="s2">hundred billion billion stars to really</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.640" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">appreciate what it means for the you</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:43.100" style="s2">know this is it right that the life that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.300" end="00:02:45.050" style="s2">we experience on this planet the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.100" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">we take for granted every single day of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.050" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">our lives is so astoundingly miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">that even to use the word miracle</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:57.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come anywhere close to how</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">incredibly unique this world is how</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.560" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">incredibly special life is consider for</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:07.420" style="s2">a moment that the most miraculous thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.390" end="00:03:09.950" style="s2">you could possibly imagine the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.420" end="00:03:11.600" style="s2">amazing synchronistic experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.950" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">multiply that by a hundred and imagine</p>

<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2">miraculous becomes ordinary and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">what in that context would be miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:27.470" style="s2">well now we&#39;re just beginning to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">there we would need to do that three or</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.470" end="00:03:30.920" style="s2">four more times to get to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:33.560" style="s2">improbability that life is on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.920" end="00:03:35.390" style="s2">planet okay and I&#39;m only saying this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.560" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">because I&#39;m trying to give you a real</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:12.769" style="s2">then in a sense that we are in a</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.769" end="00:04:19.870" style="s2">evolution being able to make choices</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.139" end="00:04:23.950" style="s2">that define the future of this plan</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.870" end="00:04:26.450" style="s2">we have drew genetic evolution and</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.020" end="00:04:37.940" style="s2">there are these risks that we have in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.240" end="00:04:39.350" style="s2">sense gotten into because of business or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.940" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">because of the way in which we organize</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.350" end="00:04:43.670" style="s2">ourselves in the world the ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">think about community and so on that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.670" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">completely overlook that there is in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">sense a greater scheme that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:54.740" style="s2">in a sense answer back to to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:57.290" style="s2">appreciate just how incredible and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.740" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2">unique just how special it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.290" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">choices that we make need to in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:07.870" style="s2">respond to the greater scheme of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">how special this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.870" end="00:05:12.650" style="s2">we think of ourselves as a species you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:14.870" style="s2">know a species that has an effect taken</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.650" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">over the entire planet and that we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.870" end="00:05:18.860" style="s2">in a position to be making choices about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:21.200" style="s2">ecosystems and what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.860" end="00:05:22.670" style="s2">resources and things like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.200" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">in effect we think about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.670" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">our own lives but we are even in</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.090" end="00:05:34.280" style="s2">comparison to other animals so much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">similar to them than we are different</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.280" end="00:05:42.620" style="s2">from Iraq right the real comparison is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:45.260" style="s2">an absolute scale not a relative one so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.620" end="00:05:49.130" style="s2">I invite you to appreciate the</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.130" end="00:05:53.690" style="s2">world is we go to beautiful places and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.220" end="00:05:54.950" style="s2">then we come back and we say well geez</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.690" end="00:05:57.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m living in an ordinary town</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">and so on and so forth there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.500" end="00:06:00.890" style="s2">place on this entire planet that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.970" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">ordinary when you think of all of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.890" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">other places you could be in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">universe to actually be here in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">paradise so when we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:17.290" style="s2">risk an existential risk and our role</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">and our choices that we make we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.290" end="00:06:22.700" style="s2">consider that the way in which our minds</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:24.500" style="s2">work to some extent is like a fish in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.700" end="00:06:26.090" style="s2">water we don&#39;t perceive the biases we</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.500" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">don&#39;t perceive the ways in which our</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.090" end="00:06:31.010" style="s2">choices actually are influenced by our</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:33.200" style="s2">biology we need in a sense a deeper set</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.010" end="00:06:35.480" style="s2">of tools to make the kinds of choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.200" end="00:06:37.130" style="s2">govern things like if we are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.480" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">in possession of evolution if we are in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.130" end="00:06:39.940" style="s2">a sense going to be influencing the</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:53.510" style="s2">need a deeper level of tools we need a</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:54.529" style="s2">unexpected for me I wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.209" end="00:09:55.940" style="s2">thinking that I would end up with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.529" end="00:10:01.550" style="s2">theory of ethics it kind of happened by</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.940" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">accident but I&#39;m beginning to see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.550" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">the most useful thing that could</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:12.199" style="s2">possibly have happened if we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.199" end="00:10:17.990" style="s2">deeper set of tools we need a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.089" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">philosophy of choice we&#39;re taught in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.990" end="00:10:21.019" style="s2">schools that philosophy is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.670" end="00:10:22.790" style="s2">useless I&#39;ll tell you as a business</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.019" end="00:10:24.860" style="s2">person philosophy is like the keystone</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.790" end="00:10:26.630" style="s2">they&#39;ve made it possible for business to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.860" end="00:10:28.519" style="s2">actually work why are we even in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.630" end="00:10:30.649" style="s2">business why are we even doing any of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.519" end="00:10:32.570" style="s2">the things that we do well somewhere a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.649" end="00:10:33.829" style="s2">level at some level or another it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.570" end="00:10:35.810" style="s2">gonna come back to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.829" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">meaningfulness what matters to you what</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.810" end="00:10:39.730" style="s2">matters in this situation what matters</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:41.810" style="s2">in life itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.730" end="00:10:43.959" style="s2">because at the end of the day that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.810" end="00:10:43.959" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:55.310" style="s2">out of this core came two ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.459" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">ethics one of them is a symmetry ethics</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.310" end="00:10:59.899" style="s2">most of you are for sure familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">this do unto others as you&#39;d have them</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.899" end="00:11:03.970" style="s2">do it to yourself the notion of equality</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:08.300" style="s2">the notion of fairness</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.970" end="00:11:09.649" style="s2">all of those are symmetry concepts the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.300" end="00:11:12.230" style="s2">piece that seemed to be missing was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.649" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">notion of continuity ethics the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.230" end="00:11:18.019" style="s2">thing that governs Continuum&#39;s of flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:21.350" style="s2">cycles that actually connect back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.019" end="00:11:23.630" style="s2">themselves the notion of continuity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.350" end="00:11:25.610" style="s2">innocence the the kind of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.630" end="00:11:29.649" style="s2">the flow that occurs between people</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.610" end="00:11:33.529" style="s2">having a certain smoothness smoothness a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.649" end="00:11:35.209" style="s2">consistent rate of change turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.529" end="00:11:36.649" style="s2">be just as important to theory of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.209" end="00:11:40.600" style="s2">as anything else that I can think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.649" end="00:11:43.190" style="s2">they it balances to symmetry ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.600" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">these may be very abstract ideas but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.190" end="00:11:48.110" style="s2">turns out that one layer past that comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">some fairly concrete things when we want</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.110" end="00:11:52.339" style="s2">to recognize what is a good choice to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">some extent we have to have an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.339" end="00:11:56.779" style="s2">what goodness means in that context what</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:59.000" style="s2">does it mean to make a good choice what</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.779" end="00:12:00.500" style="s2">is what is a way in which we become the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.000" end="00:12:03.050" style="s2">people become the person that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.500" end="00:12:06.170" style="s2">recognize when we have made a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.050" end="00:12:09.470" style="s2">choice how would we know what does it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.170" end="00:12:11.540" style="s2">mean to do that it&#39;s a choice that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.470" end="00:12:13.430" style="s2">effect is Omni considerate it not only</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.540" end="00:12:16.550" style="s2">manifests in the moment but it opens the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.430" end="00:12:19.880" style="s2">door for potentials in the future it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.550" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">in a sense of choice which considers not</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.789" end="00:14:40.389" style="s2">derived from a theory of ethics which</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.709" end="00:14:42.009" style="s2">itself is derived from a foundation that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.389" end="00:14:44.799" style="s2">is even deeper than physics because it</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.359" end="00:15:08.799" style="s2">win-win are actually contiguous with one</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.270" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">that there is an effect a sequence that</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.100" style="s2">makes it actually easier to make the</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.100" end="00:15:24.200" style="s2">that immediately follows many of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.220" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">have probably been told that if you tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.200" end="00:15:28.130" style="s2">the truth it gets easier to continue</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">telling the truth that you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.130" end="00:15:31.430" style="s2">lie you have to start building up more</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:33.140" style="s2">and more hypotheses to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.430" end="00:15:34.910" style="s2">protect that and that if you just tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:37.550" style="s2">the truth in the first place then what</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.910" end="00:15:42.290" style="s2">effectively happens is is that it just</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.550" end="00:15:43.700" style="s2">flows so the second idea beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.290" end="00:15:46.430" style="s2">that it&#39;s always possible to make a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.700" end="00:15:49.100" style="s2">win-win choice is it these notions of</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.100" end="00:15:52.100" style="s2">with one another that it makes it easier</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.660" end="00:15:53.210" style="s2">to make the win-win choice once you get</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.100" end="00:15:56.120" style="s2">to the point that you&#39;re synchronized</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.210" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">with that life flows in an omni</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.120" end="00:16:00.770" style="s2">considerate way that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.570" style="s2">good news because there&#39;s no prior</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.770" end="00:16:03.700" style="s2">reason for us to assume that that would</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.570" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">be the case</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.700" end="00:16:10.070" style="s2">the third thing which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:12.950" style="s2">important to know as far as making</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.070" end="00:16:17.480" style="s2">effective choices individually as</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.950" end="00:16:19.490" style="s2">community as a world given the huge</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.490" end="00:16:23.420" style="s2">you know we have devices that at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.650" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2">particular point that I have become</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.420" end="00:16:29.270" style="s2">aware could end all life on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">in a millisecond that even there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.270" end="00:16:33.200" style="s2">things happening in the world that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.220" end="00:16:34.670" style="s2">is a very small risk that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.200" end="00:16:37.790" style="s2">even finish this sentence and all this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.670" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">would disappear I&#39;m not here to go into</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.790" end="00:16:41.540" style="s2">those particular topics I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:44.270" style="s2">here to talk about the good things but</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.540" end="00:16:45.950" style="s2">good possibilities so we know that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.270" end="00:16:47.960" style="s2">can make win-win choices we know that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.950" end="00:16:49.700" style="s2">have the capacity to once we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.960" end="00:16:50.290" style="s2">win-win choices that it will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.700" end="00:16:52.640" style="s2">do so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.290" end="00:16:55.480" style="s2">the third thing that&#39;s important to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.640" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">is that the degree to which it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.480" end="00:17:02.060" style="s2">that we cannot make a win-win choice in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:04.310" style="s2">any given situation is proportional to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.060" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">the degree to which we need to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.310" end="00:17:13.100" style="s2">our capacity to imagine in other words</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:14.660" style="s2">that in a hyper space of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.100" end="00:17:17.390" style="s2">choices we can make that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.660" end="00:17:19.910" style="s2">gradient that allows us to essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.390" end="00:17:22.069" style="s2">seek the direction whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.910" end="00:17:23.690" style="s2">you can imagine which is the closest</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.690" end="00:17:30.050" style="s2">the closest to a true win-win choice is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.410" end="00:17:33.170" style="s2">the vector direction that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.050" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">keep going in to converge on the path of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.170" end="00:17:40.130" style="s2">right action that&#39;s actually also very</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.890" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2">fortunate because it means that we now</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.130" end="00:17:44.570" style="s2">have not only a capacity to know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.710" end="00:17:48.790" style="s2">it&#39;s worth searching for a win-win</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.570" end="00:17:53.830" style="s2">choice and that it&#39;s viable to do so and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.790" end="00:17:57.530" style="s2">to continue to do so it is also viable</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.830" end="00:18:00.110" style="s2">to use your current position to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.530" end="00:18:02.330" style="s2">to the position at which the path of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.110" end="00:18:04.610" style="s2">right action for you as an individual in</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.560" end="00:18:21.920" style="s2">actually as profound a good news as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.920" end="00:18:23.720" style="s2">possible to have which is why I chose</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.920" end="00:18:25.610" style="s2">that as this particular topic although</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.720" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">there are thousands of other things that</p>
