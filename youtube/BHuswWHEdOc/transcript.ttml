<p begin="00:00:01.120" end="00:00:07.040" style="s2">okay we are now recording my friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:08.000" style="s2">yeah so as i&#39;m mindful actually right</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.040" end="00:00:09.519" style="s2">now uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">what i would say is maybe a hope but</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.519" end="00:00:13.759" style="s2">certainly a curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">and we both came into this with um</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.759" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">apparently some energy um</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:19.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s coordinated it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">may not be they may actually just be</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.119" end="00:00:23.199" style="s2">like completely different</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">i will uh to the degree to which what</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.199" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">a true degree which there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">natural harmony i will i will orient my</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:33.760" style="s2">attention to what you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">um so the thing that i came in with i</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.760" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">was just on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">call with zack stein and brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:41.920" style="s2">one of the places that we that we found</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.920" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">and this is you and and greg and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">actually even jordan peterson came to my</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">mind here which has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:52.239" style="s2">how do i say it right so the mental</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s part of the meaning crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">have the mental health crisis but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">mental health crisis is now going</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">hyperbolic yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">because the you know the context is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">breaking us in many many different ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">yep um and i would even i would even say</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">just i would assert that from my point</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">the the moves like the place we were at</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">is intolerable and there&#39;s really only</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">two moves one move is to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">find a way up the other move is to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">down yeah we&#39;re at a bifurcation point i</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re at a bifurcation point precisely</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">practically speaking one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">challenges is the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">how do we actually provision a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">a capacity for supporting</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">individual mental health in the upward</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:45.040" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">that is adequate scalably i.e scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">would be adequate to the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">so certainly if we were to do something</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">like let&#39;s enroll</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">every professional mental health</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">socialize that and make that available</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">into some triage mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">first of all that&#39;s insane there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">way that would ever happen but even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">it did</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">it&#39;s orders of magnitude below the level</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">of capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">in fine grained capacity that&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">because the mental health crisis has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">the downward movement has a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">closing dynamics we&#39;ve got a we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">network effect moving working against us</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">so we need a network in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">working for us yep i agree so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">uh i was kind of doing the hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">pitch thing where it&#39;s like throwing out</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">combos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">triads is almost like design constraints</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">you know the player meets uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">the matrix so the dynamic was something</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">like gen z itself so targeting gen z</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">as a hey guys good news and bad news bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">news is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">nobody&#39;s coming to help good news is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">you may be able to bootstrap yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">with a little bit of help</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">with the amount of help that is coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">we may be able to work this out</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">right right and the triad was something</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">ender&#39;s game uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">book damon and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">pardon by herman hessa the book no no</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">by daniel suarez it&#39;s like a science</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">fiction techno thriller okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">um and then something like what what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">know what you&#39;re working on with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">logos what what zach&#39;s working on with</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">the academy</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">which is to say a highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">peer-to-peer protocol a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">protocol</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">where individuals can begin to get into</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">relationships that are generative i.e</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">in in operating the protocol the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">interaction between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">within pretty wide latitudes will</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">serve to upgradient them as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">and their capacity to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">relationship with each other and with</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s a a an auto</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">auto empowering network</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">empowering protocol right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to create a virtuous cycle</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">counteract a potentially vicious cycle</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">yes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">so so for example i&#39;ll give some some</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">articles artifacts to the protocol</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">and i think this this first piece is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">crucial i&#39;ll use the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">of a of a of an electrical circuit</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been working on diy solar</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">power systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">um one of the things that shows up often</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">and i&#39;ll use jordan peterson as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">archetype but there&#39;s many others in gen</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">z i think it&#39;s happening all over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">is individuals end up trying to hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">more of their social graphs total</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">need than is in fact right</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">which is to say more than they can so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">they burn they burn out</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s like if you think about it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">terms of building a a network</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">and then you build a circuit graph on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">top of a circuit like an electrical</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">circuit on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">um you have to have the right amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">the wire gauge</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">and the right kind of circuit breakers</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">for the amperage that needs to flow</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">circuit right and and any particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">location that it shorts i</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not grounded which i love the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">entendre of that will tend to have all</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">the current flow through it and it will</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">blow up</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">and so the key message here is as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">primary protocol as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">you have to take deep responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">neither being</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">more nor less than what you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">in the context of your network</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">and if you&#39;re holding and this is jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">peterson like he did the daedalus thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">or he did the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">uh uh his his hubris was in fact to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">endeavor to hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">more than was actually his to hold right</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">bear more people&#39;s crosses than his own</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">cross solo</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">and therefore this may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">true but it&#39;s irrelevant as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">and therefore actually more energy more</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">came to him than he could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">handle he actually became a lightning</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">rod</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">and the ambient energy that couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">flow where it needed to flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">found him went through him and just blew</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">him out as a circuit</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">and anybody who goes in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">or anybody who tries to do too much</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">will get blown out which ends up then</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">being a massive category here because</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">now you&#39;re no longer able to provide</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">to your network what you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">provide so not only you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">providing more you&#39;re actually actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">actually providing less which creates</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">cascade failures</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">so as a protocol the protocol is to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">very careful</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">to recognize that you you are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">permitted you are straight up are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">permitted</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.160" style="s2">to carry more than is in fact yours to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">carry</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">and a primary virtue is to have very</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">fine-grained nuance like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">deep sensitivity to that and noticing</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s crucial for you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">pull away from things when that energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">is flowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">towards you when you&#39;re reaching your</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">limit because if you burn out</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">that whole network has to get rebooted</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">as an example i can&#39;t believe how</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">constant this is with what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">so sweet all right</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">i would i would believe in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">synchronicity i made a few notes uh but</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">uh i i don&#39;t know if i need to consult</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">them very much okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">let&#39;s a slight bit of context as i</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">mentioned i just finished</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">the play by albert camus um</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">excellent book i mean and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">many many many ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">uh resonantly uh relevant to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">right now um in a profound way um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">reading it</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">with my friend dan chappie he&#39;s the guy</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve done all the work on on the with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">the rovers on mars</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">and all the technology around that um</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re both camus fans</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">and he told me there&#39;s a character in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">the book i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">with the book but there&#39;s a character in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">what you are</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">okay so he told me throughout um that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">was terror</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">um and that&#39;s uh that&#39;s he is so he made</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">identification and he was very confident</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">about it um and then as i</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">as i went along i&#39;m more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">acquiesced and i thought yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">uh this is uh and of course uh i won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">say other bookends around</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">but towards the end of the book um</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">teru says something now i knew this</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">quote had come from camus but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">association with peru was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">it really sunk into my heart because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">the identification</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">hero says you know how to be a saint</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">without god</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">is the problem i&#39;m up against today</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">okay so let me let me try and and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">does how</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">how so and then i realized okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a really pertinent way and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">the fact that he&#39;s saying that within</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">the context</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">of a plague of course made it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">resonant for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">all right and so then i started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">about this and i started thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">well as i&#39;ve been trying to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">that question i take it very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">it&#39;s in some ways a very accurate</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">self-description as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">and so and notice already you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">been talking about virtue</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">and that sort of brings this up right</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">away and then i thought about these four</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">figures</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been talking about because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">say the saint actually belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">you know a family there&#39;s the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the sage there&#39;s the saint and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to work out what the saint is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">by putting him</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">him or her into that family and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">know find the genus</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">do the aristotle thing find the genus</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">and then work out the specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">differences but then i said but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">a fourth one that doesn&#39;t properly</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">belong but is often mistakenly put in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">this category</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s the star that&#39;s the star</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">now how does this connect with what</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">you&#39;re just right man when people become</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">stars</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">right celebrities right and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">how does this resonate with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">saying because the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">right and the sage and the saint</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">are all figures that transcend</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">the normal humanity but do not grasp at</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">godhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">they do exactly what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">about they find the place</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">to like be as much as they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">but they never give in to at least when</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">behaving as they should as right think</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">about the sage</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">that goes too far in their</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">identification with god</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">because blasphemous the sage that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">the saint the sage that thinks they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">god-like wisdom has brought forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">completely and utterly the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">who can&#39;t return from the sole flight is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">no help</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">uh to his community right there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">help with community</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">but the star doesn&#39;t fall into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">the star is expected to just rise and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">rise and rise</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re not allowed to fall at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">in fact if the star stall</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">starts to fall at all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">immediately attacked</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">and cancelled and vilified</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">right and i thought what&#39;s going on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">first of all</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">what does it mean to be a saint as</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">opposed to just a shaman</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">or a sage and i&#39;d like to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">with that but then</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">what is it about the sa the saint</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">the shaman and the sage that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">is reliably different from</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">the star and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">one way to think about the at least the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">myth of jordan peterson whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">this is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">accurate description of this biography</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a much more complex and difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">question i think there&#39;s accuracy to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">but i would not claim</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">that it is completely uh that it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">complete or coherent</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">but let&#39;s say the myth is of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">listen to the language of a meteoric</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">rise right</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">to stardom he was he&#39;s been described as</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">a star</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">and a rock star right but</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">when he tried but i think initially</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">jordan wanted to be the shamanic healer</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">or he wanted to be the sage advisor</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">or he wanted to be the saintly</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">exemplification of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t stay in those</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">he got sucked into stardom and stardom</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">is a place that blows that apart because</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">it mistakes right it mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">optimization with right with</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">as as maximization of some function</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">so what&#39;s interesting to me are these</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">serve as vectors by which the network</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">can bootstrap it in the way you said we</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">need to give to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">generation z the shamans bootstrapped</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">cognition the upper paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">the sages bootstrapped the axial</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">the saints bootstrapped the christian</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">but they did it without doing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">you worried about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">but that you&#39;re worrying about here do</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">you see what i do they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">i mean obviously they&#39;re individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">fail i&#39;m talking about the when the type</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">when this archetype is working when</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">these architects are working</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get out what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">those individuals both what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">genetically shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">and what is specifically different</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">between them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">i propose to you that we need something</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">beyond the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">the sage and the saint but not the star</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:03.839" style="s2">so do you see how this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">really resonant with what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.839" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">yeah well yes and what i&#39;m noticing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">would you say if you were using you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">you&#39;d call it synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">i&#39;m feeling i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">word for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">ah okay just hold on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">so one of the things that why is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">happening so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">one of the words i would use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">the thing that is called synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">is a little bit like when you get your</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">lenses into focus</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s that it&#39;s that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">feeling of insight when a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">experiences in the outside all of which</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">have their own complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">certain elements of those distinct</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">experiences uh remind you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">of the thing that ultimately was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">shift in you you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">the shift in you has integrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">wholeness and then you project back out</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">to those and integrated wholeness that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">was happening in the outside</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">but part of that actually is that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">lensing shift and i feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">in my the back of my mind something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">wants to go there like there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">effort to try to bring something into</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">clarity uh but the lens is not a camera</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">lens it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">you know thousands of lenses that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">actually have to get into arrangement so</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">that they have the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">uh i guess they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">in a resonance so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">i&#39;m also holding that really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">metaphor like this the circuit like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">physical groundedness of the circuit</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">and that notion of the of ground right</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">that notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">the the energy like literally energy not</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">metaphorically energy literally</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">electrical energy that flows into</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">something when it&#39;s not grounded</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:35.519" style="s2">uh it&#39;s short circuits right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">fall</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.519" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">of the star right the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">star is is that and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">like an</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">ungroundedness yep that is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">move and so it&#39;d be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">question to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">okay hold on that&#39;s cool um so what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">had proposed</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">was like the the next buddha is a sangha</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">challenged with right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">is to understand how not to do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">thing in the form of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s exactly what the star is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">the star is an effort to do as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">individual which properly belongs in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right because you can&#39;t no given</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">individual human can possibly hold the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">energy and complexity that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">looking to flow through that point</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">but because the energy and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">does want to float to that point</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">if you embody it meaningfully i.e if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">can embody</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">shaman sage and saint meaningfully and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">begin to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">and to begin to integrate them that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">energy will flow into you which will</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">then begin to raise you up but by</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">raising it up it actually pulls you away</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">from the graph</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">so you actually get a reciprocal uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">collapse meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">precisely the degree to it you have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">capacity to actually hold that energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">you&#39;re setting yourself up for real</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">problems because if you pull away from</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">your actual communitas from your actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">network graph</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">you will lose this the grounding that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">you need to have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">avoid a collapse so there&#39;s an asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">problem there which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">the star becomes superhuman becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">than human becomes too godlike and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.839" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">loses connection with the groundedness</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.839" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">humanity the groundedness of literally</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">the actual relationships of other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">that hold the capacity and support them</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">so the energy can flow through them</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s like a humiliation effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">that is necessary to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">capacity of the individual to stay</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">grounded and enmeshed but also a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">recognition of the of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">next buddha is the sengha like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">no one individual that moves too far if</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">the relationships break</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">if the relationships can&#39;t hold what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">happening you&#39;ve missed it so you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">to go back down and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">we can only move if we progress in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">fashion where we&#39;re coming together</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.639" style="s2">okay this one last piece i remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">having this insight</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.639" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">many years ago maybe a decade ago um</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">maybe even 15 years ago and it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">something like you know why are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">and i said well the primary reason why</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll say the first part</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">first part um i have certainly for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">very long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">been quite a misanthrope and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">really have a very high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">personal interpersonal like yay</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">in interacting with other people or with</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">people in general although</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">examples of what people have done are</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">amazing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">broadly speaking and certainly 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">ago not a big fan of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">um and so a question is like well why</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.199" style="s2">are you doing what you&#39;re doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">answer is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">i i thought through the problem and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">reached the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">that the only way that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">solve this thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">is that we have to solve it in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">which encompasses effectively everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">yeah there is no way to save me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">no way to save my family there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">to save my tribe there&#39;s no way to save</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">my nation</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to save that subset of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">the total humanity that i care about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">without in fact also effectively saving</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s an up and there&#39;s a down and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">up is big and the down is big</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">well this is what i&#39;m saying here is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">that same thing right the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">the magnitude of the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">information that needs to flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">through the system and the system here</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">is humans in relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">other and probably technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">is enormous right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">incomprehensible how big it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">and no given individual or subset of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">could possibly hold it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">challenge is to say okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">progressively allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">that generative capacity to flow in</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">through the individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">sensitive to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">don&#39;t blow your circuit right use that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">to build more capacity in the network</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">that is around you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">that now becomes effectively a node in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">some sense right that can&#39;t blow its</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">circuit it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">kind of a fractal network graph but is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">able to flow that energy to increase its</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">own interior</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">capacity at each individual node in its</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">relationships right basically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">adding</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">stronger gauge wire and better circuit</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">breaker</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">and then and then builds the its</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">connectivity to the exterior right it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">has to be a generative process where</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">hey person over there who i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">have right now an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">interest in your betterment in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">well-being and you&#39;re being made</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">more what you are capable of of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">like for you to achieve your highest</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">in yourself and for who you are because</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">my network needs you and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">simple like very simple equation at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s the only question is really</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">a matter of like right relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">right timing</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">yeah i can&#39;t i currently don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">capacity to support you beyond this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">level now</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">for whatever reason and your needs are x</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">y and z so we just need to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">constantly find</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">what is our right relationship in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">moment and how does it up gradient</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">so that we&#39;re continually increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">quality of our individual collectives</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">and capacity to support each other</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">in that reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">wow jordan that was both eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">and revealing of you as a person so</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s a uh sorry i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a noble transformation</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">that i&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">right to go on from being misanthropic</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">uh to uh something that to my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">filetic or perhaps even agape</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">in its orientation mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">so you can say i love my kids quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.720" style="s2">dearly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and it got</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">the the experience i mean this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">christian metaphor the experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">of the gothic love of your children is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">supposed to be a metaphor that you exact</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">outwards</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">uh towards all people yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">the fact that that happened for you is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">makes a lot of sense okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">great um but i&#39;m still up against</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">tehru&#39;s problem that like he says the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">problem i&#39;m up against because</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">i was thinking you know the shaman and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">the shaman and the sage and the saints</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">but especially the saint peru&#39;s um what</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">to aspire to right they do</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">epitomize that virtue you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">about the virtue there&#39;s two virtues</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">there&#39;s the virtue of humility and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">the related virtue</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">of something like you know um philia or</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">charitas</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">the the sense of you know belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">the ecclesia</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">if you&#39;re a saint uh belonging to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">school if you&#39;re a sage</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">and of course belonging to the tribe if</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">you&#39;re a shaman and those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">paired together</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">right but teru&#39;s problem is</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">the thing that did that that kept people</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">that put a ceiling on icarus</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">and kept people bound together was</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">the divine god that&#39;s why he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">problem he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">how do you it&#39;s right how are you to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">a saint</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">without a god i mean one of the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">thinking why we have stars is because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">have the death of god</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">we fling people into the heavens because</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">we find the heavens empty</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">but they can&#39;t stay there like icarus</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">they fall back</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">down right right right right and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s a bi-variable problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">so so i&#39;m seeing like two images one</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">image is the story that you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">right now which is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">the notion of and it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">the helpful</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">you know the helpful uh wrathful god</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">when he sees daedalus going too high</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">like whacks him on the head and says</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">stay</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">there um which is i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">treat the metaphor you know this is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">kind of a bad father parenting style</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">right instead of inculcating in daedalus</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">the wisdom to make effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">creates an extrinsic uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">enforcement regime</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">that ensures that daedalus stays within</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">effective operating parameters</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">but without becoming responsible himself</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">of god</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">all right so you&#39;ve got a you know bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">god gets good results through bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">methods that effectively make people</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">weak</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">um okay that&#39;s that&#39;s one side of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">equation the other side of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">is i&#39;m seeing um what is it called like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">all right let&#39;s go with like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">like like an evangelical it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">almost like a black church where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">you know giving it up to jesus like how</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">do you maintain the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">to stay grounded to stay</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">wholesome in a world that is tragic</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">and unjust right because the key insight</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">here is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">how do i say it right all right we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">the same thing bad guy good god so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">um the key inside is look more or less</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">all of us</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">and some of us all the time but not all</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">of us all the time are faced with</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">that problem and faced with more than we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">could possibly hope to bear</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">now if we if we can&#39;t offload that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have a place to put that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">where we have faith</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to be taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">right if we if we try to take</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">responsibility for it then we&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">crushed</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s not gonna work right so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">can be very practical and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">psychological move here that&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">at a psychological level you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">have some way</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">of offloading that which you perceive as</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">being important and needful</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">and necessary to address at some point</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">by somewhere by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">but is more than what you can handle</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">individually and psychologically if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">can&#39;t get that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">move then you&#39;ll just be questioned and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">this is like you know a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">is the notion of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">being overwhelmed by a task i think i</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">think about a task</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">like just practically i think about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">task of what it&#39;s going to take for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">to rewire my rv to build my solar system</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">oh my god it&#39;s way too much now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">overwhelmed and one</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">classical psychological approaches say</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">okay well just focus on the bite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">right is there a piece that you can take</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not overwhelming and get you</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">yes okay now you can be practically</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">effective don&#39;t don&#39;t try to take the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">whole mountain at once just take the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:45.919" style="s2">step ahead of you right so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">psychological move of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.919" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">offload something that&#39;s as much</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">that is again perceived as needful it</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">has to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">be taken care of somebody somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">sometime has to take care of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a real issue but i personally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">take care of it right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">and the way to offload that in faith</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">which is to say to trust that it will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">that i&#39;m not that i&#39;m not how do i say</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">just uh stepping away from</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">responsibility right that i&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">irresponsible but rather this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">higher responsibility i know that i can</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">i can only take what i can&#39;t handle and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to take that fully right</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">now that so for the the bad god version</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">of that is precisely the move that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">actually become irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">where i actually just push off into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">into the into the ether</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">into sort of an unconstrained hope of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">things and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">and then basically and enter into</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">spiritual bypass like i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">take my own responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s right i&#39;m going to use this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">mechanism to exit that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">we could say in some sense like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">interesting i think there&#39;s a way to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">this but</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">the saints problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">we no longer have access to bad god</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">which means that we have access we no</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">longer have access to the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">work the effective mechanisms that work</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">in the context of that framing of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">divinity</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">that leaves us in trouble and we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">not yet found a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">to get what i&#39;m characterizing as good</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">god which is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">this approach that that doesn&#39;t put us</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">in context where we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">either only able to achieve</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">where we don&#39;t have a tendency to defer</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">faith or into</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">the complex of how do we maintain</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">effective operating parameters from</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">something that comes from our</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">interior something that comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">an ethos as opposed to a morality to use</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">the way that i describe those two</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">which also very very practically</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">allows us to have this quality of trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">or faith</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">which is really just a practical</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">awareness of i gotta take what i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">take and can&#39;t take any more</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">um and with any luck other people will</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">tend to carry the other stuff right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s a practical call right a call to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">hey how do we do this and i like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">practicality of it you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">carried a heavy tree yeah lifted a log</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">and carried it on your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s that that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">like let&#39;s say there&#39;s like three or</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">four of us let&#39;s make it four</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">four of us we&#39;re kind of lifting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">tree and there&#39;s a fifth person and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">look at it and they see like ah</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s too heavy for them you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">kind of see like the strain is too high</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">and they feel a calling of okay hey let</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">me help you out that sense of like help</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">and awareness</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">simple like very practical</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna lift this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">tree and we&#39;re gonna test and see</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a hope that the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">resources will arrive</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">to lift it if you&#39;ve got a good team</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">that hope is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">is based in experience right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good term for that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">like a hmm</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s a good hope like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very reasonable hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">like the hope that the uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re watching a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">basketball team when suddenly one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">players just starts sprinting down the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">court</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">and when they jump in the air the ball</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">magically lands in their hands for a uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">all of you like that&#39;s it right you just</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">kind of hope that the signal that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">just got that tells you that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">is going to happen the way it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">happen without you necessarily having</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">certainty that the the thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">is going to do what it&#39;s going to do and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">yet it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">like becoming a skillful network like</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">that allows us to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">practical hope that we can only focus on</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">what is ours to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">and expect that the network itself will</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">begin to hold more and more of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s a closure on that previous</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">topology that i was describing which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">that so i think that maybe that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">move right we to say okay i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">and bad god i don&#39;t mean evil god i just</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">mean like a an older version method of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">this set of techniques that had</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">effectiveness within certain constraints</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">but has a whole bunch of failure</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">conditions not the least which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">reciprocal closing as an end point</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">right right and this new thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">just the higher version that frees it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">from its bat from its sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">uh iron age we&#39;re all going to die</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">anyway we kind of just need to make it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">to the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">you know generation point and said no no</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">we really need to get this really clean</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">and actually be</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">a much clearer version say of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">that was really good that was very</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">helpful so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">let me try and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">pick up on some points that resonate i</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">like for example the parental metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">uh so you good parenting is generally</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:44.159" style="s2">between permissive and punitive um</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">you know so the idea is um you use the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">minimal</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">amount of force to bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">compliance that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">beyond the child on its own but that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">child is capable of managing with your</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">the zone of proximal development so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">timmy doesn&#39;t want to do x</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">um you know punish timmy just and punish</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">that punitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">you know just allow timmy to do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">timmy wants</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">right um sorry this is not meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">condescending i&#39;m just using your</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">parental</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">analogy but what you do is you you you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">try and you have to finesse the minimal</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">amount of force to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">timmy to try something that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">sense to me right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">but with you present co-present with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">timmy it will make sense to timmy once</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">timmy has taken the developmental leap</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s sort of that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">sort of parenting</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">parental links like so it that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">cultivation metaphors are used right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">you know you know if you try to make the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">plant grow you&#39;ll kill it if you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">let the leave the plant alone it dies or</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">it grows</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">it goes wild right you you the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s deep connections between</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">cultivation cultists and culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s they&#39;re resonating so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s really good but i i</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">i want to i want to sort of try and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">analogize that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">and and try to explicate and draw out</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">your analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">uh even more uh so let&#39;s call what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s um i forget i think the name</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">is authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">that which falls between uh permissive</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">and punitive and that brings up just</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">exactly the point i want to make right</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">so we had this idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">that well look at the word authority</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">and what what what makes people trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">and what people what makes people not go</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">too far but also not avoid</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">responsibility is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">authority now i agree with you that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to get an authority that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">permissiveness and punitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">and then the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">has been sort of parentally pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">um i&#39;ll use the biblical notion but</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">there are i think analogous notions in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">taoism</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">um in buddhism right is idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">that people give they give too much</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">authority to the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">right they get too much authority right</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve been thinking about that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">of course we are struggling with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">giving somebody too much authority</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">and then becoming a star and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">idolatry and that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">burns them out okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">yeah oh how cool is that okay so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">uh okay let&#39;s see so idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">and it has to do with the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">formal identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">yes and it happens is you give authority</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">and this is like we have this</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">classic kind of get a good bad yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">zach calls it has a concept he called</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">teacherly authority teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">authority has to do with the ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">up gradient of prestige that human</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">beings are oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">that that particular person over there</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">knows the what the [ __ ] they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;re honestly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">share it with quality i will pay</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">attention right that&#39;s the teacher the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">okay very much then you have this this</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">idolatrous move</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">which is the replacement of the real</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">with the with the formal identity that</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">a teacher right so now instead of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">teaching the authority being embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">the actual complex lived imminent</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">because he has the title teacher</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">attached to his identity is what we call</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">bad authority</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">right now he has assumed authority that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">he is not in fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">even main vaguely earned right right so</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">the concept of the star and i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly i think you&#39;re nailing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">there which is what happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">stars the star becomes</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">reified and now the formal identity so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">jordan peterson is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">the actual living embodied fully</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">a very large amount of of uh both</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">good and bad attention yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">which gives that access so you want to</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah but it comes with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">terrible price</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">which is that it also will be attached</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">to all kinds of other things will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:29.359" style="s2">attached to it but most important</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">terrible price is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.359" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">it ain&#39;t you yeah it never was you right</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">formal it&#39;s it&#39;s that it&#39;s an idol it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">you you&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">you you yourself have become idolatrous</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">yes you become an idol</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">right yes therein lies the problem yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">yes so sacred cows get sacrificed yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">so uh now i want to make another move i</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">you see what i&#39;m trying to do here i did</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">this with uh with andrew</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">um and i think chris i was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">how do you bring in sort of a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">of proposals that are like</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">argumentation into the biological</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to also exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">something here because i had</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">right so i schematized an argument but i</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">i&#39;m leaving</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">sorry i hope this is this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to leave space to afford so</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">bring something into it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">unanticipated by my argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">so that my argument has to shift and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">adapt yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">i hope you feel that&#39;s happening so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">move i want to make now is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">and it is to pick up on the next buddha</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">is the sangha</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">okay so and and and and you&#39;re right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">problem with stars is the it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">is the individualization of authority</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the problematic</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">right it&#39;s not all of the problematic</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">so i came back to this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">and how it&#39;s grounded ultimately in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">metaphor of the author the author who</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">writes a story right that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">that&#39;s where we get</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">the notion of authority from and then i</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">and i thought back to camu and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">thinking through the plague and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">point about the plague right is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">breakdown of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">right um human beings keep trying all</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">these narratives</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">on the plague and the plague keeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">basically giving them the finger</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">right and saying so try that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">if you want look what i can do</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">oh try that narrative you want look what</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">i can do and try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">and then you get you get the two figures</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">of ryu and taru</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">who slowly stopped a ban they abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">the narrative projection</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">they abandoned the narrative projection</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">and then it occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">and again i&#39;m thinking also of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">your game be stopped about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">break the fundamental grammar in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna i want to try very</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">carefully here and i&#39;m saying this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">cautiously</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m not fully committed to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">because the language isn&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">adequate but it&#39;s the only language i</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">have right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">i think our notion of god</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">the mythological notion is a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">right and what we&#39;re seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">is not the breakdown of a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">narrativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the death of god okay then i re</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">and then but i&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">this because i think about this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">of a debate i had with</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">not a debate a deal logos better because</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">it was wonderful with paul vander clay</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">and jonathan pajot but i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">argue that we should</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:35.760" style="s2">shift the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">from narrative to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">and here and and part of the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">went like this let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">parenting metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">okay children are not naturally narrow</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">narrative we have to do the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">practice hypothesis they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">naturally metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">we have to teach them this we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">practice it but what</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">are they naturally what is it that they</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">naturally have</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">that affords us being able to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">narrative and metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">they are naturally dialogical that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">of the work of tomasello and all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">work that&#39;s coming out</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">kids come ready like joint attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">they take turns they&#39;re memetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">right they so dear logos is more</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">primordial and more grounding and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">thought of your</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">argument about we need to drop to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">deepest</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">levels to access what is most</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">perennially powerful</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">right now so we have to drop below the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">narrative level</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">we have to drop below the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">level of authority</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s and right and we have to drop</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">into seeing no no what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">ultimately is grounded in is dia logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">and dialogos</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">is not a finite story it&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">right right no i mean i was literally i</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">i was about to drop your brother karst</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">right in the middle of it so you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">pulled it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">out which is great so i don&#39;t have to we</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have to talk anymore like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">actually on so much synthetic just the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">words will come from whatever mouth</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">happens to be open</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">great yes so much yes that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">is all about being right it&#39;s a finite</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">the trick is can i get the right</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">narrative can i get everybody else to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">adopt my narrative</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">dialogos is intrinsically the inverse of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.040" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">that or the converse maybe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">opening right it&#39;s a playful</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">relationship rather than the move is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">a move of me saying your narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">the move is to say okay how do i extend</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">this how do i build more how do i make</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a generative grammar right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">intrinsically a creative invitation to</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">more and more awesomely see narratives</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">oh another great one yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">narratives build heroes narratives</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">create that formal context right you</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">don&#39;t get narrative you don&#39;t become a</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">through narrative but the point is right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">like everything else</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">we can i we can that has fallen into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">an idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">we have to break out of that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">see something that is theological</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">but not pre-narrative but post-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">post-narrative dialogic is what we what</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">i&#39;m arguing is what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">we need if we&#39;re going to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">be saint without god</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">because that&#39;s what that&#39;s what we need</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m seeing two things let me do me</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">the second one</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">why why do i need to number them you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know who they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">um so i&#39;m with my daughter at the beach</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">and my wife is talking to me about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">notion that she&#39;s come into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">in parenting</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">which i immediately she says i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">yeah for sure begin adopting that as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">a method and it has to do with the being</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">very conscious</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">of the language you&#39;re using being very</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">conscious of the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">you&#39;re creating a a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">an obligate narrative primary mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">right and it works this way um</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">your daughter is sitting there in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">sand and she sees some object maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">you know a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">crab and you point at it and you say</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a crab</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">and then you tell a story be careful</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">crabs can pinch</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">right which is useful right in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">think for almost all parents that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">in particular contemporary environment</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of parenting right your job</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">to to weave together a sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">fabric</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">through narrative instruction that loads</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">on a construct in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">that can effectively pattern match from</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">sensorium to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">uh identity and then has a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">of adjectives and affordances attached</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">to that identity so you&#39;ve got good</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">that&#39;s all moral right that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">morality in the sense that i was using</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">her it&#39;s all bad god and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">the top down authoritative constraint</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">the the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">which is that what i&#39;d say is the solve</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">to this problem is to be conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">of actually orienting in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">of wonder so</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">and just like the simple question i</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:02.240" style="s2">wonder what i wonder what would happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.240" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">i wonder what might happen here i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">how that right to have as a primary mode</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">of interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">pedagogy and invitation to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is notice the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">difference there&#39;s no third person</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">that is right god pointing and telling</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">loading that is it&#39;s actually very first</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">person i wonder which is a really</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">interesting invitation because</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">she may not give a [ __ ] if she&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">years old she may be like i don&#39;t wonder</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">that i&#39;m gonna go do this</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s an invitation to do are you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">also interested in this wondering</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">if so then we can wonder together and if</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">not you don&#39;t really feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an invitation that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">have constraint and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that&#39;s dialogue right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s an invitation into</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">something where we begin to co-create a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">um what you call a wonderful like a a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">world of of intrigue and and playing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">with the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">as opposed to trying to box it up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">pre-framed knowings of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">okay so two riffing responses to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">right away so ellen langer one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">first people to bring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">uh into uh the western academic frame</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">you know she talks about soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">versus heart focus but she also talks</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">about uh conditional versus absolute</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">so and what you what she did is she went</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">into textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">and textbooks are almost always at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:20.880" style="s2">absolute learning so absolute learning</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.880" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">it is an x conditional learning is one</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">is as and that it is an axe right so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">framing around</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">the proposition that you want to pass on</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">is one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">radical identification versus</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">conditional identification</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">and what she found and this comes to no</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">surprise that if you give people</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">absolute learning they are not as good</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">at learning they&#39;re good they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">good at</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">storing the proposition but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">good learners</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">using the proposition using the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">knowledge they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">right the grasping the significance but</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">which is supported by doing conditional</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">language so that&#39;s one piece</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">so conditional versus absolute the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">right is uh dweck&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">fixed versus malleable mindset so</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">if i praise you and say you&#39;re bright</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">you will think of yourself as having a</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">fixed trait and then what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">get into image management</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">because you don&#39;t want that trait to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">lost yep</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">but if i praise you for the process i i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">wow that was a very good skill you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">or that was a great sequence you went</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">through i love that learning process if</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">so if you praise the process</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">then what happens is people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">actually improve their performance</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">and they will expose themselves to risk</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">trying to manage a fixed rate they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">grow a malleable trade now what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">about that by the way is getting people</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">to shift the focus from the product to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">the process it&#39;s also central to making</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">them more rational</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">that&#39;s so people tend to over fixate on</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">the products of their cognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">and not enough on the process and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">what makes them subject to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">so here&#39;s the thing what if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">if you had the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">conditional representation of the arena</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s your wonder</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">hey i wonder what this is here&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">there&#39;s another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">and then also a malleable</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">agency hey what you just did there was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">really good process it&#39;s a really great</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a really impressive skill right</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">yeah absolutely this is exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">and and i think that if i kind of i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">going to pop it up and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind i&#39;d also like to bring</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">in something over here that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">keeps showing up</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">and i think it might be really</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">interesting so let me pop this up so</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this a big move that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">that&#39;s funny i thought about it i&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">nietzsche right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">nietzsche makes the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">the warrior and the soldier</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">yeah um manuel delanda points out the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">whole history of the tailorization the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">forwardization</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">move of people in general right through</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">code disciplinary power</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:09.119" style="s2">which is to say that move what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">describing right there</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.119" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">and the the the trade-off or or what</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">if if if i optimize</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">for the what was the kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">that was just</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">direct direct learning there&#39;s absolute</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">versus conditional</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">right and then there&#39;s fixed traits</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">versus malleable traits</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">so basically if i optimize for absolute</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">in a in a particular strategic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">i can achieve local optima yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2">all right i can beat you to that thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">if i know what the thing is and i you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">know i&#39;m frederick the great</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">and i train all my soldiers to be this</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">clockwork army and everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">exactly this thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">i get this it turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">short-term advantage</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">yeah right over somebody who puts a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">longer-term investment in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">capacity right right this constant</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">a game that is iterating by a series of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:10.880" style="s2">short-term local optima</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">at the expense of games that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.880" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">focusing on on global optima</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">is like a fundamental conundrum right</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">dynamic that describes a lot of the big</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">problems yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">at the core of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">that&#39;s why i put it into the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">exactly so the was it</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">was our previous conversation with greg</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">maybe it was but that that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">being able to say look there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">have your cake and eat it too</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to have the the moment</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">be kind of as good as it gets at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">local level</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">and also be directly connected in</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">to the best possible long-term strategy</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about like when</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">the niche is changing</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">fast enough that local optima just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">falling they keep evaporating</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">but the only valid strategy is something</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">that&#39;s actually taking this bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">approach this i think a big part of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">current moment why the pivot from</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">gaming to game b is is uh is both</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">relevant and salient right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">all right sort of let me do the second</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">move though okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">please all right so the second move is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">uh maybe a little bit of like an</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">invitation for for i guess it&#39;s paul and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">so my my uncle who was only 16 years</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">older than me</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">um he passed away about i gotta think</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">two years ago not long ago maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">year ago</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">yeah a year and a half ago um</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">and he was he was a deacon in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:42.400" style="s2">catholic church</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">right so which is you know takes a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.400" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">significant amount of dedication</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">and energy yeah and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">that he and i did in the last</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">he had cancer so we sort of took a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">in the last six months a year</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">is we read the bible together remotely</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">like i would read portions of it then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">would talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">and i was i was really reminded of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">uh the book of acts and what we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">just talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">about and what i mean by that is and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">was just</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">as i was curious i wonder i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">the movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">from the so the fulfillment of the book</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">right and the line</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">of of the crucifixion the resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">followed by the holy spirit right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">that and the the the continuity or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">continuation</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">of of the of the church is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">the the holy spirit&#39;s presence in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">church which is to say in the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">right and it feels to me like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">very interesting relationship what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">were just talking about right the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">movement from</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">a old testament god that lives</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">outside as a separate entity that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">provides wrath</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">to enforce obligate behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">and this transition to the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:01.119" style="s2">which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">imminent in the people in the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.119" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">the church who are now fully responsible</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">for interrelating with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">becoming capable as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">of feeling and living with the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">but then also living through it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">right living living it into the world um</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">as the good</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">right the thing that i was describing as</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">the good god and it contains i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">everything we&#39;re describing like all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">words that we&#39;re using and all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">transitions</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">all uh talk about what that is like on</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">that other side</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">so that came to me as well well i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">chris and i talk about the third factor</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">that emerges in the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:37.760" style="s2">practice like when dialogue when</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">dialectic of before it&#39;s the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.760" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">we talk about the third factor as the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">geist uh because we wanted to determine</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">the german term because it stands</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">between mind and spirit right</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">yeah intelligence and consciousness um</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s something that we&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">of working out in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">the cognitive science of dialectic india</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">logos so let&#39;s keep that as</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">one of the balls i&#39;m going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">juggle here but i&#39;m thinking of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">about the holy spirit first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the logos becoming dear logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">jesus is the logos but what does he say</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">where two or three are gathered in my</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">name there i am also</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s a connection there between</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">the holy spirit right coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">and then you get the recommendation to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">not try to plan what you&#39;re going to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">when you come before the emperor the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">powers of the principalities</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">don&#39;t rehearse a narrative or a story</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">because you will be clamping down</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">on the possibility of the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">speaking to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">the third right is the idea that when</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">we&#39;re praying</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">the holy spirit is actually from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">deepest level</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">praying through us and affording our</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">prayer</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">and so there is i know this is heretical</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">maybe this is the time of all heresies</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">um right uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of reinterpreting the holy</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">spirit especially as it&#39;s portrayed</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">functionally i guess of the way i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">trying to use it and phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">uh in in the new testament especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">the book of acts</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s consonant with it being you know a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">dialogical entity</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">that is trying to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">post-narrative or trans-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">in some really important</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">fashion so i think that&#39;s deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">funny i mean i guess i&#39;m listening with</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">particular ears but i didn&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">anything heretical on what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">and you were using a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">words but i if i understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">mean by</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">you know jesus was the logos yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">the the commandment the requirements to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">move to dear logos right and that must</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">uh two or three right gatherings in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know for some reason that felt</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">like that was a way of saying it that if</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">i listened clearly</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">the spirit was speaking perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">yes um and maybe i&#39;m wrong i&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">we will have</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">comments that will let us give us more</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">information on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">um but that feels right and let me just</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">kind of put another piece in there</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:13.839" style="s2">one of the a conversation i had with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:13.839" style="s2">someone um was about</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">how do i say it like</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">concern about separation from their</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">lived experience in the church</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">catholic church in this case um and as i</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">listened</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">what i diagnosed was precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">replacement of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">for the logos the replacement of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">narrative for the actual spirit</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">yeah and this is a super common place</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">right to pray</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">my wife right she was raised catholic it</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:44.880" style="s2">kind of blew her mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">when she said well what kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.880" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">narrative are you engaging in when</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">you&#39;re praying</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">i was like none like that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">that would totally get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">yes yeah yeah um and then she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">wait oh wow so</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">this the idea of like hey guys this is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:01.440" style="s2">set of words that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">that you kind of if you repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.440" end="00:56:04.559" style="s2">practically speaking maybe right</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">practically speaking it&#39;s like a mantra</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.559" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">practically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">it will help you get into the place that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">we will call prayer</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.799" style="s2">right over here but then the mistake of</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">oh no this is prayer in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.799" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">get to the place and then this is in</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">fact so much prayer that you don&#39;t never</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t even get to the place you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">forget it exists right so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">that movement</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">um i would say that&#39;s heresy</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:28.720" style="s2">and i would say even if it comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">really nice medieval sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">right which is hey you know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">hard this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">hard living is hard we got barbarians</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">all the time plagues all the time like</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a mess</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">and so we kind of got to get some psycho</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">technologies in place that have</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">like their you know water wheels and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.319" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">cranks that successfully you know grind</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">the wheat so we&#39;re going to do this</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">we&#39;re going to put these techniques in</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">place that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">have some degree of efficacy but then of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">course right the idolatry of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">technique is just as bad as the idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">of the person</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">yeah i guess that&#39;s all i thought that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.079" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">was a the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">the water flowed through and now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">done empty no i like i like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">that disjunct um</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">and i think i can circle back to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">point you made about people remaining</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">grounded and not losing their humanity</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">this came up in the discussion with uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">paul and jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">wonderful discussion i highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:24.559" style="s2">it a real deal logos very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">um but i was pointing out jesus use of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">parable and the work of sally mcfagg</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:31.040" style="s2">who work on metaphorical theology and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">book speaking in parables</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">and also related work i forget by whom</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:36.880" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">um the parabolic stories of uh that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.880" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">sufis used</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">and what mcflag points out is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">parables look like narratives but</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">right so i was using the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">always meant a great deal to me and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.640" end="00:57:52.079" style="s2">remember reading uh carol shields</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">updated version</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.079" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">of the parable of the prodigal son and</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">this looks like a story and you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">you&#39;re reading through it and here&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">archetypal roles on one son another the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">servant the father</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">oh right and and you can see people</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">wanting to allegorize it well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">god the father and all</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t work and the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">of the parable is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">the whole point of the parable is if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">try to resolve it</p>

<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">no no compassion always trumps justice</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">you lose it our humanity is in the tonos</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">that cannot be captured by a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">it can only be captured dialogically</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">right it can only be captured</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">dialectically and the point about a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">parable it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s what i call it a narrative time</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">bomb it looks like a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">you take it in and assimilate it as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">narrative and then it blows the holes</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">out of your narrative and opens you up</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">to a trans narrative accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:54.319" style="s2">and so i think right if the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">is the spirit of the logos wow i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">know i can&#39;t believe i&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">and the logos is the the logos</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">most properly taught in that parenting</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">style that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">the wonderful parenting style by using</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">parable then i think we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:15.119" style="s2">this is consonant with you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:15.760" style="s2">chris you know and uh i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.119" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">to call it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.760" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">but you know i think it&#39;s a heretical</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">interpretation of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">that may actually again answer peru&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">of how to be a saint without god</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">yeah it does i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">so so the this this way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">right this way of because</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:43.760" style="s2">you know and i think i i think of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">the other great existentialists you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">mentioned nietzsche but you think of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">kirkegaard see me nietzsche does</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">something where he undermines narrative</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">by being multi-vocal</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">actually saying or what the story is</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">because he&#39;s uh he gives you he writes</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">like the bible there are many</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:01.760" style="s2">conflicting stories and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">perspectives and they all continually</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">undermine each other and so he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">he destabilizes anything right and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">that&#39;s powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">um and and a lot of people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:13.839" style="s2">that when they read nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:15.680" style="s2">they pay too much attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.839" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">content of what nietzsche says</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.680" end="01:00:19.520" style="s2">and not enough to the manner of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">process they idolize nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">rather than emulating him which is a big</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">mistake but i&#39;m thinking of the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2">one kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">right and kirkegaard writes in parables</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">he even</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">writes things that are called like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">are explicitly parables his novel many</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:35.599" style="s2">of his novels have parabolic</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">parabolic structure to them in which he</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">like the diary of the seducer he gives</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">you this narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.079" end="01:00:42.880" style="s2">but then he undermines it from within</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">right because he&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:46.559" style="s2">and although i have deep problems with</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.559" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">part of his thinking what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">thinking about recently and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">sharing with you is</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">right and i don&#39;t like even his</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">terminology but i think this is what he</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">was trying to get at with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:59.359" style="s2">tibialogical suspension of the ethical</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to use ethical the way you</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.359" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">use morality</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.920" style="s2">okay so the point of the ideological is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.920" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">ethics is bound into narrative</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">personhood</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">and there is something that is supposed</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">to be beyond that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">that is trans personal and trans</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:20.160" style="s2">narrative which human beings</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">are ultimately called to this is why you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.160" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">the thing that within the within the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">is horrific and it&#39;s in it and notice</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a request from god to sacrifice a</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.960" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">right and narratives are all about</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">persons and their their evaluation</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">and that all that story always bothered</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">me and it bothered kirkegaard and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">there&#39;s ways of interpreting that story</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">that i think are evil and pernicious</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:46.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m playing with the idea well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:49.280" style="s2">that story</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.559" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">that story is exactly right what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.280" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">talking about here is this a story of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:55.839" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">ultimately narrative personhood</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.839" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">and the ethic right isn&#39;t ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">that it actually right the dialogical</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">to that which transcends the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">what is ultimate yeah right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">a parabolic structure in there</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a story that actually undermines</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">all stories</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s pivot to a conversation you and</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:21.200" style="s2">i had</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">i think two times ago right which uses</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.200" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">language of paradigm yes right and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">talked about the notion of the context</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:29.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:29.760" style="s2">acceleration</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.400" end="01:02:33.920" style="s2">accelerating change the change in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">underlying reality of the context that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.920" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">and then mismatch the paradigms breaking</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.599" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">apart faster because the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">a paradigm is a narrative right yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">okay i get it so if i have a you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">things more or less don&#39;t change a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:50.799" style="s2">for 500 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">right we write a narrative we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.799" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">dial it in it&#39;s a solid narrative</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">and we run it and we kind of lose track</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">of it you know 200</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">300 years later we sort of lost track of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">the fact that somebody at some point</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">created a narrative but when things are</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:05.920" style="s2">changing rapidly enough that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">actually are seeing narratives emerge</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.920" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">break down emerge and break down in like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">months it becomes rather obvious</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">that that tool right that that grammar</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">right the narrative grammar the grammar</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">that produces paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">is no longer an effective way of being</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">an adaptive relationship with the real</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">reality that you happen to find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:30.880" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t seen that oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">the connection between being trans</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.880" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">narrative and being</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">you know transparent digmatic i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">oh my gosh thank you</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">huh i had yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:58.319" style="s2">yes very much oh that&#39;s beautiful jordan</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.280" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful what</p>

<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to bring them all together</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:34.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way in which the next</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">buddha can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.400" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">the same and that&#39;s the way and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:40.160" style="s2">a way of being within that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">sainthood without</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.160" end="01:04:46.559" style="s2">god yep which is to say that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">move from the logos to the deal logos</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.559" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">yes yes and what&#39;s funny about is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">in many ways it&#39;s i find it also to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">quite simple like</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">you talked about like what does the kid</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.480" style="s2">come with like straight up</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">yeah yeah you know logos machinery is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">um and then we build other stuff on top</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">of it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">it is a what do they call it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">archaic revival there&#39;s like a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">bit of an archaic revival it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">let&#39;s go to the deep stuff let&#39;s find</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">the deep deep deep stuff that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">billions of years or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">millions of years of adaptive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">and bring that back up but you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re not going back</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing it back up and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">resurfacing it in a whole new context</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">with an enormous amount of what i would</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">call consciousness meaning yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">a way of being aware of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">talking about now and actually having a</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">process a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">improve the process right to name the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:38.480" style="s2">process as being good and then to</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">improve the process</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">along the vector of its goodness yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:45.039" style="s2">i would call that both consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.039" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">in the way in which i&#39;ve tried to expand</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">the notion of rationality</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">um so that to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">right i mean uh i haven&#39;t read a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">wilbur&#39;s work but he makes</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.280" style="s2">he he he notes that um and maybe this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">relevant to jordan</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.280" end="01:06:05.520" style="s2">peterson in some fashion wilbur says</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">that one of the problems with young is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.520" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">what he calls the pre-trans fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.760" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">the young does not adequately</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">distinguish between pre-egoic</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">and trans-egoic that they can be deeply</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">confused together</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:20.400" style="s2">and that can really mess people up so in</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">an analogous fashion</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.400" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">i want to distinguish between the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.920" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">pre-narrative and the trans-narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:27.839" style="s2">versions of</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">the logos and that what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.839" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">do with conscious rationality</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:37.000" style="s2">is not regress to pre-narrative dialogic</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.839" end="01:06:40.559" style="s2">but to try and progress to</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.000" end="01:06:43.839" style="s2">trans-narrative dialogic theologians</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.559" end="01:06:44.640" style="s2">yes absolutely and just to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.839" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">since we&#39;ve got cool greek prefixes</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.039" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">let&#39;s distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">trans-narrative and meta-narrative yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">right meta-narrative is just a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:56.240" style="s2">narrative yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">trans-narrative is a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.240" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">thing altogether exactly that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:01.359" style="s2">well said too</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">right that&#39;s very well said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.359" end="01:07:05.920" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">well i think that was most of what i</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.920" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">talk about did did i give you also a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">place for you to</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:14.319" style="s2">uh develop some of what you brought some</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">of your energy that you brought into</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.319" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">uh yeah yeah absolutely um in</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">a very sort of uh very secret way</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s exactly right there was a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">i just want to call this out as a gem um</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">that meant a lot to me i mean there was</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">a lot that was meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:34.319" style="s2">and provocative and insightful but when</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.960" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">you said that what we were doing was</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.319" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">sort of putting clothes</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">on to some of your ideas or putting</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">flesh out of it i can&#39;t remember this</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">that really touched me very deeply oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:50.319" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">hmm gives me hope man excuse me hope</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.319" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">okay so i i i propose that we end it</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:57.680" style="s2">yeah sounds good it&#39;s a good play but</p>

<p begin="01:07:57.680" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">this is not an ending in the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">sense uh it&#39;s like sart said</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.520" end="01:08:03.930" style="s2">uh you never complete anything you only</p>
