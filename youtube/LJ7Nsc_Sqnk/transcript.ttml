<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:08.280" style="s2">grief is a fascinating process and it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">we are not well served in thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.280" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">it by the degree to which depictions of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">grief are so far from the mark there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:22.699" style="s2">a way in which things like grief and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:31.130" style="s2">dreams are depicted very badly in</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.699" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">fiction and so we we tend not to have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.130" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">clear conscious relationship with our</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:37.649" style="s2">own grief experience we&#39;ll go through it</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll even forget what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.649" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">like but I would argue that grief a it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">is clearly an adaptation as difficult as</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">it is to face most creatures don&#39;t face</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">grief they lose an offspring or you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">a partner and they move on you know a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">cat that loses a kitten mother this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">kitten</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:09.619" style="s2">can&#39;t really afford to miss a beat</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">because you&#39;re probably other kittens</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.619" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">and so anyway they don&#39;t show grief in</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">the same way that some creatures do but</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">certain creatures do show grief and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:24.890" style="s2">group of creatures that shows grief is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:28.220" style="s2">very interesting so we we see grief in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.890" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">chimpanzees we see it in elephants</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.220" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">obviously people dogs and what I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.530" style="s2">argue this tells us is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">something about highly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.530" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">highly social creatures that causes</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">grief to effectively be reinvented each</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">time because we and elephants and dogs</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">and chimpanzees don&#39;t all share some</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">ancestor from which we&#39;ve inherited</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">grief maybe we do with chimps but dogs</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">and elephants would be a totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:07.640" style="s2">separate pair of evolutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">so why would this debilitating state</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.640" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">evolve adaptively in creatures that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">highly social and highly intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:22.130" style="s2">what is the state now the first thing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:25.739" style="s2">realize is think about the way a funeral</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.130" end="00:02:30.830" style="s2">actually is rather than the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.739" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">typically depicted the funeral involves</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.830" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">people often somber but not always in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">the same room in a funeral you will see</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">even the closest kin of the person who</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">has been lost laughing talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">mundane trivialities and crying all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">these things exist together and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">experience of grief is one in which one</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:09.390" style="s2">will face intense periods of reflection</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">and sadness interspersed with everyday</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.390" end="00:03:18.390" style="s2">experiences interspersed with periods of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:21.150" style="s2">having completely put aside this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.390" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">incredible loss and that period will go</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.150" end="00:03:27.180" style="s2">on for months it goes on actually rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:30.140" style="s2">intensely if you&#39;ve lost somebody close</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">for a full year</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.140" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">in fact the Jewish tradition involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">not placing a headstone until a year has</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:41.480" style="s2">passed after the burial which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:44.209" style="s2">always thought was and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">an indicator of something significant</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.209" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">about it having gone through a full</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">year&#39;s worth of holidays and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.769" end="00:03:54.470" style="s2">celebrations and seasons without the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:58.519" style="s2">person that has been lost before one</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.470" end="00:04:02.030" style="s2">memorializes or memorialize was fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.519" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">but in any case I will argue that grief</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.030" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">is the downside of love and what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:20.510" style="s2">by that is when you love somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:22.550" style="s2">prioritize them in your mind sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">trivial almost but you prioritize them</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.550" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">in your whole conscious schema you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2">expect them at certain places and times</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">you depend on them you integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">into your understanding of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">when they are lost</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:42.590" style="s2">you have to unintegrated that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.180" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">mean that you forget them but it does</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.590" end="00:04:47.410" style="s2">mean that to the extent that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:50.539" style="s2">was very important to you that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.410" end="00:04:52.580" style="s2">expectation has to be excised from your</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.539" end="00:04:55.340" style="s2">active program so that you do not</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.580" end="00:04:57.169" style="s2">continue to expect them so that you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.340" end="00:05:00.919" style="s2">not depend on them when they can no</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.169" end="00:05:02.990" style="s2">longer show up if in the terrible</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.919" end="00:05:06.820" style="s2">circumstance that it it&#39;s your child</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.990" end="00:05:12.979" style="s2">that you&#39;ve lost you can no longer live</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.820" end="00:05:15.020" style="s2">with the same obligations in other words</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.979" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you&#39;ve lost a child but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.020" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">you have other child&#39;s you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">reschedule everything in what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:24.950" style="s2">understand based on the reality that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:26.810" style="s2">child that you had banked on investing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.950" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">in over their life is no longer in need</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.810" end="00:05:33.560" style="s2">of your help and your other children are</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:37.729" style="s2">so I would argue that to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.560" end="00:05:41.960" style="s2">we love somebody that they are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.729" end="00:05:45.410" style="s2">woven into our our own program and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.960" end="00:05:47.570" style="s2">unweaving process cannot be simple if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.410" end="00:05:49.669" style="s2">was simple than the relationship that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.570" end="00:05:51.500" style="s2">had with that person couldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.669" end="00:05:53.479" style="s2">very deep in the first place so if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.500" end="00:05:54.660" style="s2">relationship was deep the unweaving of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.479" end="00:05:57.530" style="s2">that person</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.660" end="00:05:59.730" style="s2">to be deep and I would argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.530" end="00:06:03.080" style="s2">pattern of grief that we experienced</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.730" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">where you have these intense periods of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.080" end="00:06:10.170" style="s2">anguish that are interspersed with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:12.900" style="s2">periods of normalcy and that the periods</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.170" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">of anguish become farther and farther</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.900" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">apart but they don&#39;t become less fraught</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:22.010" style="s2">until finally they do that that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:25.050" style="s2">emblematic of the fact that your brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.010" end="00:06:27.780" style="s2">keeps discovering places that the person</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.050" end="00:06:30.540" style="s2">who has been lost was wired in and at</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.780" end="00:06:32.490" style="s2">first you find all of the obvious ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.540" end="00:06:34.410" style="s2">all of the circuits that become active</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.490" end="00:06:36.120" style="s2">regularly it becomes apparent that oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.410" end="00:06:39.210" style="s2">this is caged and that has changed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.120" end="00:06:41.310" style="s2">as time goes on the remoteness of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.210" end="00:06:44.100" style="s2">circuitry that the person was connected</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.310" end="00:06:45.300" style="s2">to grows and so their frequency with</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.100" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">which you encounter one of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.300" end="00:06:57.590" style="s2">circuits goes down and so in this way</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:07:00.570" style="s2">the person finds their memory</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.590" end="00:07:03.210" style="s2">recategorize so that you no longer are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.570" end="00:07:07.110" style="s2">depending on them in a living way so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.210" end="00:07:10.890" style="s2">agree it is neither a full excision nor</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.110" end="00:07:15.200" style="s2">a full transformation you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.890" end="00:07:17.730" style="s2">there aspects of whoever this person was</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.200" end="00:07:20.030" style="s2">that are no longer relevant after</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.730" end="00:07:22.770" style="s2">they&#39;re gone right one doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.030" end="00:07:24.300" style="s2">deal with their dietary restrictions for</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.770" end="00:07:25.860" style="s2">example after they&#39;re gone so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.300" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">point in really even remembering what</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.860" end="00:07:32.250" style="s2">they were necessarily on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:36.830" style="s2">their insight might be very valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.250" end="00:07:40.410" style="s2">so one might take what one expects of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.830" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">this particular person&#39;s view on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.410" end="00:07:45.419" style="s2">world and they might build it into an</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:49.169" style="s2">internal structure that they can access</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.419" end="00:07:51.540" style="s2">so for example I know my grandfather was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.169" end="00:07:55.710" style="s2">very important to me and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.540" end="00:07:59.460" style="s2">he taught me a lot about how to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.710" end="00:08:02.730" style="s2">things and he was very he got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.460" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">reputation as a safety nut but he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.730" end="00:08:08.760" style="s2">a safety net what he was was very good</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">at anticipating how things fail so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.760" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">he could engage risks and not have it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">come back to haunt him and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:18.690" style="s2">transferred this to me you know he would</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.190" style="s2">he would give me a hint about what he</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.690" end="00:08:22.350" style="s2">thought I was doing wrong and how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.190" end="00:08:27.330" style="s2">might end up coming back to hurt me and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.350" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">when he died I remember noticing that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">was as if a ghost followed me up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.080" end="00:08:35.700" style="s2">ladder every time I went up a ladder to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:39.450" style="s2">do some work on some electrical</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.700" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">component or building something and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.450" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">remember it&#39;s a very young person like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">boy I think he warned me about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">danger of people leaving things on top</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:58.950" style="s2">of ladders and I know that when you move</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">a ladder you if somebody has left</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.950" end="00:09:01.800" style="s2">something up there whether it was you or</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:03.510" style="s2">somebody else when you move the ladder</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.800" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">you tend to tilt it back towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.510" end="00:09:07.290" style="s2">yourself and if it&#39;s a hammer and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:10.260" style="s2">left it up there it&#39;ll fall right on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.290" end="00:09:11.880" style="s2">your head and so one doesn&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.260" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">this when one goes to put something down</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.880" end="00:09:14.340" style="s2">you&#39;re up a ladder you don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">places to put things</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.340" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very natural to put things on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:20.910" style="s2">top space and then to forget that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">were there you go down the phone is rung</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.910" end="00:09:25.590" style="s2">your cup of coffee is ready whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">go down and then you realize you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.590" end="00:09:29.270" style="s2">move the ladder and you&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:32.070" style="s2">what you&#39;ve left up there so somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.270" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">needs to build an extra circuit that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.070" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">checks about what&#39;s up there and am I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:38.520" style="s2">really safe to move the ladder am i</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">certain I didn&#39;t leave something heavy</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.520" end="00:09:42.360" style="s2">up there or something that could fall on</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.740" style="s2">my eye or something like that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.360" end="00:09:45.750" style="s2">have the sense when I interact with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:49.020" style="s2">ladder that my grandfather&#39;s there in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.750" end="00:09:50.670" style="s2">particular and that he sort of throws a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.020" end="00:09:52.470" style="s2">little elbow my way and says it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.670" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">you sure that ladder is clear before you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.470" end="00:09:56.910" style="s2">go and move it we were pushing a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">far here but is your grandfather just</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.910" end="00:10:01.339" style="s2">information after he&#39;s done or is there</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">like a presence is there a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.339" end="00:10:06.899" style="s2">intimacy that persists between you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:08.670" style="s2">this person who&#39;s gone that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.899" end="00:10:12.449" style="s2">overcomes like that time death period</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.670" end="00:10:14.129" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t think this isn&#39;t troubling</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.449" end="00:10:17.639" style="s2">to me at all I&#39;m comforted by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.129" end="00:10:19.619" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like my</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.639" end="00:10:22.259" style="s2">grandfather has become a safety robot</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.619" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">that you know the barn bell goes off</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.259" end="00:10:25.470" style="s2">when I interact with the ladder I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.319" style="s2">comforted by the fact that my</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.470" end="00:10:32.579" style="s2">grandfather isn&#39;t really gone that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.319" end="00:10:34.619" style="s2">been taken you know internal and I like</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.579" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">the idea that he looks through my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.619" end="00:10:39.089" style="s2">and that things that he never he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.999" style="s2">live to see that you know in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.089" end="00:10:43.649" style="s2">I can let him see things that he might</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.999" end="00:10:45.269" style="s2">have been fascinated by or if I go</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.649" end="00:10:48.629" style="s2">somewhere in the world he never went and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.269" end="00:10:51.410" style="s2">you know I can sort of allow him to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.629" end="00:10:54.929" style="s2">it you know and it&#39;s one can torture</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.410" end="00:10:56.759" style="s2">oneself with you know how literal is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.929" end="00:10:59.669" style="s2">this the answer is well it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.759" end="00:11:03.959" style="s2">literal at all on the other hand maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.669" end="00:11:07.259" style="s2">it is because at the same level that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.959" end="00:11:09.179" style="s2">know I am the conscious me but I am also</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.259" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">the unconscious me and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.179" end="00:11:13.769" style="s2">me is aware of things that the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:16.350" style="s2">me isn&#39;t and so you know I can torture</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.769" end="00:11:19.439" style="s2">myself with whether I&#39;m one people or</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.350" end="00:11:21.419" style="s2">several and you know among the several</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.439" end="00:11:25.499" style="s2">there are the people that I&#39;ve cared</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.419" end="00:11:29.179" style="s2">about and lost and in any case it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.499" end="00:11:32.579" style="s2">comforting to me that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.179" end="00:11:35.369" style="s2">presumably I will die before my children</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.579" end="00:11:38.459" style="s2">do and they will have known me very well</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.369" end="00:11:43.980" style="s2">and I feel some comfort in the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.459" end="00:11:46.889" style="s2">as long as they live that some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.980" end="00:11:48.660" style="s2">the part of me that mattered will still</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.249" end="00:11:55.919" style="s2">dietary restrictions I&#39;m happy to take</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.959" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">will be predicted by certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.309" end="00:12:08.879" style="s2">characteristics okay that the surprising</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.709" style="s2">nature of a death to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.879" end="00:12:12.329" style="s2">somebody was really not expected to die</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.709" end="00:12:13.619" style="s2">because they were young because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.329" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">were healthy or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.619" end="00:12:16.889" style="s2">makes grief all the more in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.630" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t do any of the work</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.889" end="00:12:21.329" style="s2">ahead of time to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.630" end="00:12:23.670" style="s2">somebody is old or infirm you may have</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.329" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">grieved enough by the time they&#39;re gone</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.670" end="00:12:29.509" style="s2">that there&#39;s no work left to do and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">can actually result in people having</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.509" end="00:12:33.149" style="s2">guilt over the fact that they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.399" style="s2">grieved somebody that they believed they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.149" end="00:12:37.079" style="s2">cared very deeply about and frankly we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.399" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">need to free ourselves from that because</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.079" end="00:12:42.990" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s been really sick and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">your brain knew they were gonna go and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:47.819" style="s2">it prepared by doing the work ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">time it&#39;s not that you didn&#39;t agree if</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.819" end="00:12:52.350" style="s2">it&#39;s that you&#39;ve already grieved and so</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.350" end="00:12:56.759" style="s2">the person tells you how much you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.180" end="00:13:02.069" style="s2">gonna grieve because some of the grief</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.759" end="00:13:03.779" style="s2">can happen ahead of time so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.069" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">degree to which somebody is important to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.779" end="00:13:09.269" style="s2">you can actually create weird phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:11.730" style="s2">the number of people who intensely</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:55.649" style="s2">your obligations and it is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.439" end="00:13:57.899" style="s2">how similar in some ways those two kinds</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.690" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">as it is is not a big loss in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.280" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">what you&#39;re capable of doing you can get</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:50.810" style="s2">another dog for one thing but in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.730" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">ways they take on the role of you know</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.070" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">substitute for children and so their</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.140" end="00:15:08.630" style="s2">loss is much more shocking and painful</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">than people expect who haven&#39;t been</p>
