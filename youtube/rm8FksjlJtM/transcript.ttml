<p begin="00:00:05.050" end="00:00:09.709" style="s2">so the conversation between Brett</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.430" end="00:00:12.950" style="s2">Weinstein and Richard Dawkins has just</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.709" end="00:00:13.969" style="s2">come out they have it in October and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.950" end="00:00:15.530" style="s2">lot of people were really looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.969" end="00:00:17.090" style="s2">forward to it and thinking it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.530" end="00:00:19.490" style="s2">really significant moment in</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.090" end="00:00:21.050" style="s2">evolutionary biology I know that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.490" end="00:00:22.970" style="s2">Brett was thinking about it and by</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.050" end="00:00:24.920" style="s2">coincidence I&#39;ve just come back from</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.970" end="00:00:27.349" style="s2">doing a whole set of interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.920" end="00:00:29.689" style="s2">Brett and with Heather and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.349" end="00:00:31.910" style="s2">things we talked about was the Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.689" end="00:00:33.710" style="s2">debate so in a minute I&#39;m gonna play the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.910" end="00:00:35.570" style="s2">whole of that interview with Brett but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.710" end="00:00:38.539" style="s2">just wanted to frame it first because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.570" end="00:00:40.100" style="s2">know for Brett in particular the point</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.539" end="00:00:42.860" style="s2">of difference the disagreement that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.100" end="00:00:46.340" style="s2">had is something he thinks has held up</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:50.930" style="s2">evolution since about the 1970s my</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.340" end="00:00:54.440" style="s2">argument would be Dawkins self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.930" end="00:00:57.379" style="s2">was a triumph it really would have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.440" end="00:00:58.430" style="s2">hard time having been better from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.379" end="00:01:02.300" style="s2">point of view of the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.430" end="00:01:05.449" style="s2">contribution in one small volume but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.300" end="00:01:08.119" style="s2">did uh sure in a broken assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.449" end="00:01:10.580" style="s2">because we never fixed it has become the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.119" end="00:01:14.600" style="s2">obstacle that I think my entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.580" end="00:01:17.210" style="s2">generation now faces in the study of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.600" end="00:01:18.650" style="s2">human evolution at least and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.210" end="00:01:20.299" style="s2">time we fixed it and I thought this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.650" end="00:01:23.509" style="s2">little interaction right at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.299" end="00:01:25.790" style="s2">beginning of the debate said a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.509" end="00:01:27.890" style="s2">the different perspectives that Brett</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.790" end="00:01:29.689" style="s2">and Richard Dawkins are taking into it</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.890" end="00:01:32.540" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna play it quickly now The</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.689" end="00:01:35.299" style="s2">Selfish Gene you wrote in 1976 am I</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.540" end="00:01:38.119" style="s2">correct about that you were 35 years old</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.299" end="00:01:41.810" style="s2">so Richard wrote that book as a young</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.119" end="00:01:43.729" style="s2">gun and I find it shocking that I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.810" end="00:01:46.369" style="s2">to say this but I think that that book</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.729" end="00:01:48.469" style="s2">is still cutting-edge and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.369" end="00:01:51.049" style="s2">things we may end up talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.469" end="00:01:54.409" style="s2">tonight is why it is that there has not</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.049" end="00:01:56.990" style="s2">been more progress after the huge burst</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.409" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">of activity that we saw in the late 60s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.990" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">and early 70s why my era has been much</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.850" style="s2">quieter with respect to important</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:09.770" style="s2">discoveries about evolution that we all</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.850" end="00:02:14.210" style="s2">agree are true you have anything to add</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.770" end="00:02:17.180" style="s2">yes I I don&#39;t quite know why you find it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.210" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">knocking I mean of course we all pay lip</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:20.120" style="s2">service to the idea that progress is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:24.920" style="s2">good and we should be changing all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.120" end="00:02:26.770" style="s2">time but what if we&#39;re right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">does it doesn&#39;t necessarily follow that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.770" end="00:02:32.660" style="s2">that what people thought in the nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:35.270" style="s2">sixties and seventies is still largely</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.660" end="00:02:38.240" style="s2">believed is a bad thing maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.270" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">actually right so I&#39;m going to play the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.240" end="00:02:43.880" style="s2">whole interview with Brett now but why I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">think this is really important is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.880" end="00:02:48.860" style="s2">this goes really to the heart of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">of the key questions particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.860" end="00:02:54.770" style="s2">utility of religion therefore the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">atheist framework that Dawkins is coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.770" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2">from I&#39;m going to let Brett examine it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.550" style="s2">explore it and describe in his own words</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.970" end="00:03:03.100" style="s2">and play the whole interview now</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.550" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">recently you had a very high profile</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.100" end="00:03:08.630" style="s2">conversation with Richard Dawkins in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:09.580" style="s2">Chicago how did it go I think it went</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.630" end="00:03:12.770" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.580" end="00:03:15.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a conversation I had been waiting</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.770" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">to have literally for decades in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">particular I&#39;ve been very interested to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:29.060" style="s2">know what he would respond if a careful</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:33.020" style="s2">articulation of the idea that religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.060" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">has to be an adaptation that we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.020" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">view the religious beliefs of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:41.300" style="s2">populations that have held beliefs for</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:43.220" style="s2">thousands of years we should look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.300" end="00:03:45.380" style="s2">more or less as we look at an eye or a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:47.510" style="s2">wing or any other phenomenon that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.380" end="00:03:51.170" style="s2">the hallmarks of adaptation rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.510" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">looking at them as a mind virus the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.170" end="00:03:57.320" style="s2">Dawkins has famously dismissed them it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">has always seemed to me that if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.320" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">proper argument was laid in front of him</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">that Dawkins being a famously honest</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:07.940" style="s2">broker as an intellectual would have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:10.700" style="s2">acknowledge some reality to it and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.940" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">think we got closer to that than many</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:16.280" style="s2">people imagined would be possible it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">clear on stage that Dawkins was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.280" end="00:04:23.330" style="s2">tension with himself over his his</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:27.140" style="s2">beliefs and on the one hand when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.330" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">pointed out that mind virus suggests</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.140" end="00:04:31.669" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">these belief systems are pathological to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.669" end="00:04:37.250" style="s2">the people who hold them and that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:38.690" style="s2">is not only on unproductive way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.250" end="00:04:41.419" style="s2">approach people but that it is at odds</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.690" end="00:04:46.099" style="s2">with the elegance of the way selection</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.419" end="00:04:48.830" style="s2">tends to work he initially argued that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.099" end="00:04:52.970" style="s2">people had over interpreted the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">of mind virus and that really every gene</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.970" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">in the genome could be portrayed in such</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.849" style="s2">a light which is an argument I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:02.659" style="s2">understand it&#39;s not the connotation</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.849" end="00:05:07.220" style="s2">people get when you say mind virus I him</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.659" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">and I said that the connotations when</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.220" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">you say mind virus are that these people</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">are mentally ill and he protested he</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:15.830" style="s2">said well they are mentally ill so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.569" style="s2">know on the one hand he was being you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.830" end="00:05:20.090" style="s2">know the careful dawkins that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.569" end="00:05:22.610" style="s2">remember from you know the mid-seventies</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.090" end="00:05:24.830" style="s2">and on the other hand he was being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.610" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">strident older dawkins that gets himself</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.830" end="00:05:29.659" style="s2">into such trouble over religion and both</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.889" style="s2">things were evident within you know a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.659" end="00:05:32.870" style="s2">couple of sentences of each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.889" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">because this this question is right at</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.870" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">the heart of New Atheism effectively on</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.539" end="00:05:48.409" style="s2">stage I told Dawkins that religion</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">cannot be a mind virus on stage I told</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.409" end="00:05:54.620" style="s2">Dawkins that religions that have existed</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">for thousands of years cannot be mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.620" end="00:06:01.909" style="s2">viruses but that New Atheism can and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:04.069" style="s2">really believe this new atheism is novel</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.909" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">it has not stood the test of time and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.069" end="00:06:09.259" style="s2">fact it creates a problem for many of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:12.130" style="s2">who might otherwise be willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.259" end="00:06:16.099" style="s2">called atheists because it has taken on</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.130" end="00:06:20.469" style="s2">an ideological fervor rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.099" end="00:06:23.240" style="s2">a an argument that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.469" end="00:06:24.979" style="s2">supernatural explanation for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.240" end="00:06:32.509" style="s2">phenomena that we find within the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.979" end="00:06:34.940" style="s2">universe it has become a a challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.509" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">people who view the universe otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.940" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">and that desire to challenge people</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:44.349" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:47.530" style="s2">Challenge ideas is not helpful even if</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.349" end="00:06:50.979" style="s2">New Atheism began in a productive</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.530" end="00:06:53.860" style="s2">direction it became so focused in doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.979" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">battle on behalf of an idea that I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.860" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">it just lost its way and it ceased to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:02.949" style="s2">able to see that it had gone too far</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:06.099" style="s2">that in fact it is one thing to point</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.949" end="00:07:09.430" style="s2">out that religious traditions are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.099" end="00:07:12.370" style="s2">literal it is another thing to argue</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.430" end="00:07:14.199" style="s2">that they are error because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.370" end="00:07:16.780" style="s2">what they are there they are much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.199" end="00:07:18.159" style="s2">than error what&#39;s your definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.780" end="00:07:20.620" style="s2">moment I&#39;ve heard you say before that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.159" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">they are metaphorically true but</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.349" end="00:07:44.650" style="s2">we if we look at it with respect to did</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.949" end="00:08:19.330" style="s2">heaven and make it less likely that one</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:24.460" style="s2">that behaving in that honorable way will</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.000" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">very likely that your descendants will</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.529" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">like Dawkins are unable to see this kind</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:45.220" style="s2">stuck since about 1976 which is the year</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:50.470" style="s2">that Dawkins published The Selfish Gene</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:03.730" style="s2">made a quantum leap in that book in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.790" end="00:10:04.709" style="s2">direction of a proper theory of human</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.709" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">he also made an error that has gone</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.660" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">unrepaired in the entire intervening</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">period when he introduced the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">memes thereby providing a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">discussing cultural evolution in</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:29.470" style="s2">rigorous terms by analogy to genes</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">he argued that memes evolve as if in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.470" end="00:10:36.550" style="s2">new primeval soup he uses that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">and were that the case it basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.550" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">suggests an independence of memetic</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">of our physical nature if those two</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.230" end="00:10:54.850" style="s2">things are independent then you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:56.380" style="s2">get things like religions that evolved</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.850" end="00:10:59.320" style="s2">to further their own interests at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.380" end="00:11:01.930" style="s2">expense of the creatures on whose minds</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:05.149" style="s2">they are running that would make sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.930" end="00:11:09.439" style="s2">given his his argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.149" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">if it is not correct that memes exist in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.439" end="00:11:16.389" style="s2">a new primeval soup then it is likely</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:19.309" style="s2">and I argued on stage that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.389" end="00:11:24.430" style="s2">cultural traits are obligated to serve</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.309" end="00:11:27.589" style="s2">genetic interests so in such a context a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.430" end="00:11:30.559" style="s2">religion as mind virus makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.589" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">because what we can infer is that as</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.559" end="00:11:34.879" style="s2">much as people may believe things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.589" style="s2">are literally false they are believing</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.879" end="00:11:39.649" style="s2">them for reasons that are apparently in</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.589" end="00:11:42.439" style="s2">the interests of their genomes and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.649" end="00:11:45.470" style="s2">is where a proper theory of human</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.439" end="00:11:49.639" style="s2">evolution would have to go so in essence</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.470" end="00:11:51.949" style="s2">tied up in this one very small error is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.639" end="00:11:53.480" style="s2">the entire branch of the tree that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.949" end="00:11:55.189" style="s2">should be exploring in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.480" end="00:11:58.910" style="s2">understand ourselves as products of</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.910" end="00:12:03.499" style="s2">not in complex systems when we get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.730" end="00:12:06.470" style="s2">it is it is something of this nature</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.499" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">where the tiniest alteration of an</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.709" end="00:12:20.360" style="s2">we pass on the tradition of studying</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.540" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">we need to figure that out very quickly</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.950" end="00:21:59.729" style="s2">I just want to pick up on something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.779" end="00:22:03.029" style="s2">Brett said at the end there which really</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.729" end="00:22:05.629" style="s2">reminds me of Jordan Peterson&#39;s concept</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.029" end="00:22:07.960" style="s2">of the shadow the bread is saying if</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.629" end="00:22:09.519" style="s2">we&#39;re not aware that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.960" end="00:22:11.950" style="s2">programs we&#39;re not aware that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.519" end="00:22:13.899" style="s2">monstrous then we are doomed to play</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.950" end="00:22:15.100" style="s2">that out very similar to what Petersen</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.899" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">says about the shadow if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.100" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">realize that we&#39;re monsters then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">much more likely to act that out in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:24.450" style="s2">world and that also connects with</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:27.490" style="s2">something that Brett said a few times</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:29.769" style="s2">which is that Altru Maps must align</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.490" end="00:22:31.960" style="s2">which I find really really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.769" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">like the kind of Jungian psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.960" end="00:22:36.669" style="s2">Peterson which is an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:38.230" style="s2">mythological system can align with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.669" end="00:22:41.320" style="s2">evolutionary biology in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.230" end="00:22:43.899" style="s2">Brett&#39;s framing there so next up Brett</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.320" end="00:22:46.059" style="s2">may have another public debate coming up</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.899" end="00:22:46.990" style="s2">with another biologist called David</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.059" end="00:22:49.119" style="s2">Sloan Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.990" end="00:22:51.639" style="s2">if Twitter is anything to go by and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.119" end="00:22:53.710" style="s2">and I recorded another short film about</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.639" end="00:22:55.749" style="s2">that trying to contextualize and explain</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.710" end="00:22:58.659" style="s2">why that&#39;s important which you can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.749" end="00:23:00.940" style="s2">if you go to Brett&#39;s YouTube channel now</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.659" end="00:23:03.100" style="s2">I put the link below this video here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.940" end="00:23:05.309" style="s2">quick clip of that there&#39;s an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.100" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">riding on the question of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.309" end="00:23:11.080" style="s2">evolution takes place at the level of</p>
