<p begin="00:00:53.440" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">and log into democracy ai so that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">could interact with us that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">something that they should um do but in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">i made a joke about still fumbling with</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">tinder in order to get the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">going and i got a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">flood of correspondence from people</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">under 35 who alerted me that tinder is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">only a physical mechanism for starting</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">fires it is also now a software platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">that allows people to have sex with each</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">other without having to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:26.720" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t realize that but</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">anyway my bad uh we were in fact talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">uh real tinder of a metaphorical kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">for our campfire so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">let me explain a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">campfire is and why we&#39;re using that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">campfire is a place that for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">likely millions of years humans have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">gathered</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">at the point when the light was failing</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">they were therefore no longer going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">be ecologically productive and at those</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">moments</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">people would either have talked and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">joked and sung and danced</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">and in times that were not so good they</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">would have talked about what was</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">supposed to happen next so we in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">unity movement have appropriated</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">the metaphor of campfire to stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">these kinds of conversations and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll see there&#39;s lots of outgrowths</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">using this metaphor among them a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">campfire is something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">take a an ember from and start your own</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">discussions which is something we very</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">hope that you will do all right so let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">so i think we wanted to talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">bit we get a lot of questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">movement about um various questions like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">what is our ballot access plan obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s too late to collect signatures</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve said that we do have a ballot</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">access plan etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">we also receive feedback about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">that several</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">people andrew yang has expressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">doubt about the unity um ticket and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">uh he is on our list of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:49.759" style="s2">nominees dan crenshaw has said he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">planning to run</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.759" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">for higher office so there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">in the air which is what is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">are thinking in light of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">that some of the people that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">nominated are apparently not</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">um yet on board and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">we wanted to have a little discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">about this so you could understand how</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">i think the first thing to say is i</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">would expect</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">people who were in a good position</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">to lead the nation to have this reaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">until</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">we deliver a groundswell and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">this is uh very much a matter of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">of the political situation that we find</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">that is to say andrew yang is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">uh simultaneously somebody who appeals</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">to a great many of us who see the danger</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">that the republic is in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">he represents somebody who has expressed</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">a new approach that has captured the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">of many and he is also somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">functioning within the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">establishment so</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">uh he is in a position where we do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">want him burning bridges</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">and he does not want to burn bridges and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">so we essentially expect</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">um for him to decline until</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">we make it clear that there is some path</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:09.759" style="s2">for him to actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">achieve a leadership position um</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.759" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">you guys want to this goes yeah</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">so um we&#39;re asking you why did you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">choose that ticket and we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">see your answers and understand where</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">and for those uh watching that uh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t get in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">until before uh the maximum was reached</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">on democracy ai</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">and while that question is being asked</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">on democracy ai can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">uh maybe enumerate those tickets and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">about the process of assembling a list</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">sure okay so essentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">what we discovered in our primary</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">process was that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">unity 2020 community nominated six</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">people um at a disproportionate level</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">and it just so happened that three of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">those people</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">were identified as left of center and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">three of those people were identified</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">as right of center so the left of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">centers</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">were tulsi gabbard andrew yang</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">and jesse ventura</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">and the right of centers were admiral</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">jocko willink and dan crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">and so we could go through the math here</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">pretty clear you can take any one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">those left of centers and you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">pair them with uh any one of three on</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">the right and then you can go to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">second left of center and pair them with</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">one of the three on the right etc and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">you come up with nine</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">possible combinations</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">now i should remind people why it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">uh that you know there were various</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">reasons to have a left of center and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">right of center paired but</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">the most prominent of those reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">the most important is that</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">in order to break the increasing</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">aisle but they&#39;re friends they get along</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a problem interacting</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">productively so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">this tells us how far off our process is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s constantly settling on</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">people um who are uh less capable of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">uh less likely to trigger people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">um sense that they are honorable</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">yeah i couldn&#39;t agree what more with you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">brett and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">this movement for me has really been a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">proof of concept um</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">you know my friends and family asked me</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been doing for the last month</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">and a half and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">um i have found a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">that believe that we can come together</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">in disagreement and fully make</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">things better and make the country</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">better and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">the candidates that we&#39;ve chosen and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">that we&#39;ve nominated</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">are are like the biggest um the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">manifestation of that because every day</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">you know back and forth and we spent so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">many hours making this happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">and this has been truly a show that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">america is still capable of agreement</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">and coming together</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">and compromising on things that need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">be compromised in order to make progress</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s really been a beautiful process</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">um i i hope we succeed but you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">succeed or fail at the uh initial</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">mission that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">chosen it is heartening to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">a process that brings together people</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">who are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">ready to to participate this way with</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">each other and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also something i&#39;ve seen in my life</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">prior to unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">where um i found myself interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">lots of people who were</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">you know quote unquote from the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">side lots of conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">and it was amazing how regularly i</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">felt uh welcomed by them i got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">you know there was a belief among many</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">that uh you know a rational liberal was</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">not something that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">uh were even sure existed and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">in any case i&#39;ve had many many</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">conversations and uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s we are told things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">about how difficult it is for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">along and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">um hopefully the unity movement will</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">reveal to people that there is a path to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">getting along and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">difficult it really</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of uh disbelieving what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve been told about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">unreasonable other people inherently are</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">yeah there was a there was a moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">during the uh 2016 primaries that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">stuck with me like a knife in the back</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">and it was during one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">debates</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">and it was sort of the last closing</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">and for the democratic primary and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:47.679" style="s2">the question asked was to the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">what do you think is the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.679" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">threat to america</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know whether it was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">bernie</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">and hillary at this point or whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">there were some other answers but i only</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">remember there are two answers</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">bernie said climate change and yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">know that&#39;s a standard</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">uh left-leaning answer um you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">necessarily get a lot of agreement to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">that on the right side of the aisle</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">but hillary&#39;s answer was the republicans</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">and in that moment in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">she lost the election and won the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s the problem with our process</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">right now right is because we have these</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">engines that force you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">to tear apart the country</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">in order to have the chance of running</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">and it needs change and to to riff off</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">your point elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:49.520" style="s2">i just have to echo everything you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">you know since</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.520" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">joining this incredible group of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">i am gobsmacked day after day</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">after day of just how much work</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">people are putting in and how much just</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">raw talent and creativity is at display</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">every single day</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">and the best part is i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s i&#39;ve met dozens of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">over the last you know several weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">months um that i&#39;ve worked with on</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">various projects</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">and i think i maybe know</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">two of their political orientations like</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">we recognize the promise like okay if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">can if we can get off this brink</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">if we can save ourselves from this</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">hazard</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">then let&#39;s start an argument and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">have some great arguments but first</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s solve let&#39;s bail the water</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">out of the boat</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">um and get to shore in time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s incredibly encouraging because</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">right to your point you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">we&#39;re making a moon shot right now like</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">no no one has any illusions about it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">know we&#39;re not delusional people</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">we&#39;re recognizing the magnitude of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">and recognizing that given the magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">of the danger we have to attempt the</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">and if we fail then this is the network</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">that i want to be able to call to</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">we would imagine would be on board and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">are uh slow to come around</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m i can&#39;t quite help it but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">building a model in my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">of what people&#39;s resistance is because</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">in their regular lives i hear people uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">complaining about the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">choices they&#39;ve been offered</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">i hear people fearing for the future</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">i see people choosing to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">like leaving cities that they&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">in for decades</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">some of them are selling homes they</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">don&#39;t even know where they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">right so there&#39;s something going on that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">seem to suggest that this was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">the moment i mean we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">elected the next president it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">an obvious moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">at which we could do something new and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">different and yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">even as people are upending their lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">contemplating things they never thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">that they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">to worry about there is still resistance</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">to something</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">of this nature and so anyway i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">curious if you guys have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">of what it is that keeps people from</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">joining and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">then i&#39;d be happy to share what i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">is up</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">well really quick i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">perfect question</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">and let me just interrupt you at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">ryan because democracy ai</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">65 of our of our participants want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">know what we see as the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">challenges for this movement</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s really the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">question on everyone yeah so we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">so to if i can rephrase your question a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.559" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">um i think what is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">that stops someone who buys a bumper</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">sticker that says giant meteor 2020 or</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">any functioning adult 2020 what is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">stops the person that buys that bumper</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">sticker</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">from signing on board because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">that that&#39;s the bumper sticker version</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">that illustrates the problem but for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">some reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s instead of actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">articulate or</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">fight for or seek a solution</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">it turns into cynicism so</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">is it is it just the sheer sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">impossibility is it just the sheer sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">of being outnumbered</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">or the learned helplessness helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">uh as</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">eric said on the first campfire you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">what is it well i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">go ahead i was gonna say that i think a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">lot of it comes down to comfort</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">people are comfortable where they are as</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">far as where they are intellectually or</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">where they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">in their day-to-day lives whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">that means that they struggle</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">financially or anything like that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s really difficult for people</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">to make a change and for people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">imagine something that&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply unsettling and uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">to imagine something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist and then when the answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">to your questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">or when the answer to you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t imagine when it&#39;s right in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">front of you it&#39;s even more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">accept that i think because</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">you have a different idea what it should</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">look like or this or that you just have</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">these different conceptions and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">i think i think our biggest challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">showing people that we&#39;re all in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">together and we&#39;re all learning together</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">and nobody has all the answers and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">i think is really important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">while we&#39;re up here and you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">hit</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">we we&#39;ve been in this movement for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">while and brett has</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">you know a lot of public notoriety none</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">have all of the answers um but we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">but we can find the solution together</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">important to remember but it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">for people to get there because we want</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">to be told what to do and when to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">well i want to point out something i</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">think you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">comfort and i think you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">your answer hints at the following thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">people fear being blamed</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">for something right everybody knows that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">outcome in the next election that will</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">cause whatever group they&#39;re hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">to be frightened and upset</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter whether you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">understand for example that we built</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">the unity 2020 proposal</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">uh so that it would not spoil an</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">so that we would not be putting people</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">blamed</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">people are so used to the idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">anything other than what your friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">group is saying is the required action</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">in this election</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">that you&#39;re responsible for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">outcome might happen other</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">than you know the win and i should say</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">republicans and i don&#39;t know why that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think it&#39;s inherently</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">in this election there is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">of moral obligation not to think outside</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">that this is the answer and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">i think what distinguishes the</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">is a recognition</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">that it actually everybody seems to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">one disaster or the other and a small</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">number of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">see two disasters and an uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">choice between them i honestly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">know which outcome i</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">fear more right i know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">trump nominally is farther from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">values that i think are most important</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know that a trump presidency</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">is more dangerous than a biden</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">presidency in light of what biden</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">is playing with in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">partners and policy so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">to me you know i&#39;m not all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">which disaster it&#39;s going to be because</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">i think both of these disasters are so</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">that it is unthinkable that we cannot at</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">least attempt to divert our course</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">which is the whole reason i&#39;m here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to divert our course from</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">and i think a lot of people who were</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">thinking similarly</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">heard that message and responded but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">when we talk to other people if you if</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">you have a blind spot that covers one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">the disasters</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">right and you only see the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">disaster then the point is well this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">election is as obvious as it could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">right you got to vote for a or you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">got to vote for b</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">and the problem is um how do you reveal</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">to people what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">their blind spot yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">i think there&#39;s there&#39;s something i want</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">to highlight</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">about what you just said and having you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">know watched</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">a lot of your arguments and streams for</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">a while now brett i</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">i find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a response that comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">not necessarily your arguments in</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">specific but</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">this style of argument that&#39;s tries to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">not have</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">either of those blind spots that tries</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">where we&#39;re at and it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">both side isms it&#39;s the milk toast mod</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">this is discussed with milk toast</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">moderated</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">uh moderation um and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">the thing to convey and i i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">this just because i think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">for people to know</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not the argument isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">the two sides are the same they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">different they have a very different</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">taste and character</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">and shape um and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s they have a charge</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">symmetry right the tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:27.840" style="s2">two of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">is in some sort of balance even though</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;s playing out in different fields</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">in the on the federal government in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">federal government right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">the republican interests are</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">overwhelmingly overrepresented in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">in the sort of if if i could coin the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">federal cultural government right in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">hollywood and in the universities it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">universally left of the center right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">there&#39;s domain distinctions about where</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">battles are playing out but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s a symmetry of tension and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">i&#39;m less interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">in which team wins the tug of war</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">what i&#39;m interested in is the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">explosive potential energy that is being</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">generated in the rope</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">because when that rope snaps like it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">who gave the the last tug that snapped</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">the rope</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">what matters is that the rope is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">snapping and we&#39;re all going to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s very very well said</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">um nonetheless i i have</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">a sense that people there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">people&#39;s if people fast forward and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">that is just pleasing to their</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">social group occurs in this election</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">they fear that they will be blamed if</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">done anything other than the standard</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">thing and i think frankly</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">it i almost see like rooms full of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">all of them wanting to entertain some</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">other possibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">but all of them are afraid that the room</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">is going to hold them</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">responsible and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of thing that really it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">requires almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">a comedian to figure out how to phrase</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">it to get everybody to laugh</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">and simultaneously acknowledge they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">all fearing each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">you know they&#39;re everybody&#39;s fearing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:24.960" style="s2">room is going to hold them responsible</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">when really the room wants to revolt</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">yeah and let me just uh chime in here</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">with the audience&#39;s answers which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">much much simpler than ours</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">so effectively our audience says that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">people haven&#39;t heard about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">um that they don&#39;t know about it or</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s impossible and i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">sort of touched on the impossible part</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">stepping outside of your frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">so that you can see that maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">i mean this is viable first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">20 20 and anything is possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">second of all it&#39;s possible um because</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.280" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">we do have a plan</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">and one of the other um big questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">from the last poll of when we asked you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">um when we asked the audience four</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">questions was</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:16.180" style="s2">let me pull it up right here sorry i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">when they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">they recognize that their forces that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">are working against us</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">and that could work against us that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">could that could seriously damage the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">um and that&#39;s not a reason that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">uh you know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">well i&#39;ve lost my train of thought now</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">but that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">is are you keeping the ballot access</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">strategy a secret because those who</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">oppose unity2020 could foil the plan in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">some way if it were to get out</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll let you take that one yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">let&#39;s just say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">we all know the plan there is one okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">so the people who say there&#39;s no plan</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">that this is mathematically impossible</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">at this point are just</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">simply incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">the only reason to keep it secret is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">the those who oppose any sort of unity</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">including unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">from foiling the plan in order to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">continue to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">hold whatever power they hold so um i</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a secret that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">a plan that seeks to restore</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">the public&#39;s influence over policy would</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">have many</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">enemies that those enemies would be well</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">resourced and would</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">use any means at their disposal so</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s really no reason to share</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:53.599" style="s2">information with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">so it just seems to me very</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.599" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">we could in an effort to show that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">you know not lying we could reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">plan at</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">some substantial cost to the plans</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">working now that said we are getting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">a point</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">where uh it becomes important</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">to share the plan and to activate it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">uh we will get there soon if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">be kept apprised of things this is a an</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">excellent reason that you should</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">register</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">uh for our email list so that you can um</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">be looped in as quickly as possible but</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">at some level i want those</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">who are listening to listen</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">better and to think harder right</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">to the extent that you want something</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">different to happen to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">you are looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">choices that the major parties have</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">delivered you and thinking to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">oh my god how could we possibly be in</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">such a bind</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">then you are also somebody who should be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">open to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">that if there&#39;s a way to get there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">it requires you not knowing this instant</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">exactly how it works</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">that you should be on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">and you know if it turns out we&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">i guess you&#39;ll find that out and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">have egg on our face but would we really</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t make any sense from i</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">mean you know from my perspective does</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">it make sense to pretend that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">plan when there isn&#39;t when that will</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">ultimately become clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">of course it doesn&#39;t so um it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">mean the plan will work</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to like it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">is there a plan of course and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve been clear with you all along</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d like to add on to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">oh you go elizabeth no please ryan</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">well there&#39;s a distinction right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">this is clear to all of us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">clear to everyone that&#39;s already signed</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s sometimes not clear to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">the critics or at least they weaponize</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">the potential</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">ambiguity that a a plan is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">synonymous with a guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">right um so if i can touch on that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">word impossible</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">right um there&#39;s two types of impossible</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">there&#39;s very very very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s perpetual motion</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">there&#39;s violating the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">right um and a plan</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">gets you to the second type of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">you know it was impossible for colonists</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">to go up against the largest empire of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">the world that&#39;s ever known</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">it was impossible to abolish slavery and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">maintain the union it was impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">fly it was impossible to secure</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">women&#39;s suffrage it was impossible to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">to the moon</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">the history of this country is a history</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">impossible accomplishments and it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">turn so are you going to try or are you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">give up without trying and let our</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">country disintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">which it clearly is doing so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">we&#39;re being forced into uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">into attempting the impossible and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t shock anybody that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">people are responding anyway go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">oh no i was going to say that um so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">and when you when our audience on</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">democracy ai went through the onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">questions they identified as</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">um their their different age groups so</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">we categorize people into boomers</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">millennials etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">and it seems that boomers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">millennials surprise surprise don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">on a lot of things however um we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">you know there is a lot of entrenchment</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:29.599" style="s2">from boomers</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">on not being able to break outside of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.599" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">the frames that they don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">realistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">and they can&#39;t get away from the party</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">um that cynicism is too high</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">and so i think we need to really</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">ryan to your point like look to these</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">things in the past that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">accomplished and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">you know incredible things that were</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">never possible that now</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">you know shape our world um we need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">really look</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">that were once that that have once</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">served us</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">yeah i mean we are in some sense or</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t even serve us</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">really i mean if you look at it they</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t really serve us at all because</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">look at where we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">however we can accomplish so much and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">need to believe in ourselves to do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">we need to believe in this so at some</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">level i would</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">ask people um to</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">stop considering unity 2020 in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">isolation right you may consider this so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">unlikely as to be not worth considering</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">but how likely is it that a major party</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">would field a candidate who can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">allowed off</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">script because he&#39;s no longer competent</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">to uh deploy a message</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">off the cuff this is a remarkable thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">this is a candidate who&#39;s going to face</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">debates presumably</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">nobody knows how that&#39;s going to play</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">out so we are dealing with a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">already um in the realm of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">not because of anything that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">we&#39;re just simply responding to it so</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a landscape of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">impossible it is the era of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">and the fact that this is an impossible</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">uh plan</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">as ryan points out it&#39;s it&#39;s of uh was</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">it type two impossibility ryan</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">did i it was yeah type two impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">all right do we have more um data coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">back from democracy ai</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">indeed we do um we have a question here</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">uh what&#39;s the plan for continuing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">movement after november if not enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">swell to activate in this election</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">and what i would say to that is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">unity is about leadership and regardless</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">of our moonshot what unity does is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">shows us who our leaders are in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">country and it helps us identify leaders</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">not only on the public sphere but</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">in our own channels and in ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">i think that no matter what happens we</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">need to continue seeking the values in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">and finding the leaders that we deserve</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">yeah i think this is this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">right and one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.079" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">i in fact in all of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">inside the unity movement</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been party to this has never</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">really been a question</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t on my mind when i set the ball in</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">motion but as soon as people started to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">gather around it and it became clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">that we don&#39;t see exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">but we see</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">very much um analogous</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">frightening processes unfolding danger</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">to the republic</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">that seems to call many of us to action</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">if the plan fails to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">recapture the white house in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible setback but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">reduce the need for a unity movement</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">obviously the need for a unity movement</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">only increases in that frightening</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">circumstance so at some level it has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">uh we are learning from this process</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re discovering each other which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">um it&#39;s a great reason to join is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">finding out how many people you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">far-flung people that you would never</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">have encountered otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:21.200" style="s2">uh are feeling the same way about where</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">we are and recognizing the same sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.200" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">obligation that yeah the movement has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">it has to do whatever is necessary and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.359" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">would say in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m realizing is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">simultaneously a movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">that is apolitical it is non-ideological</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">but that that has more content than you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">in other words a non-ideological</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">should oppose corruption and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">sense unity is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">a movement against corruption it is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">movement about</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">restoring the democratic force so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">it governs policy</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">you know essentially if your ideology is</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">non-ideological if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">democracy if you believe that consent of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">the governed</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">is the source of the legitimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">then you should be for a process that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">purifies that so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">it actually is meaningful consent of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">governed rather than</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">coerced consent where really you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">manufactured consent as chomsky would</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">um so yes the movement has to continue</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">i&#39;m sure it will</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">change in the aftermath of this election</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">hopefully we can keep it on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">positive track because</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">inside the movement it is uh hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">and reassuring and patriotic and as ryan</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">said up at the top</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">you meet people you find that you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">very much in alignment with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know their political</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">background because</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not highly relevant right</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">patriotism is patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">and to your to your point brett um i</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">as much as this is about leadership it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">about teamwork</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s the whole point of the unity</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">ticket and in thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">candidates i know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say crenshaw for instance a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">people think that maybe crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">is um you know not favorable enough to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">to the democrats or or something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">and what i say to that is that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">if crenshaw&#39;s then paired with tulsi</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">gabbard</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">that balance is out and so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">someone&#39;s fighting for you in the office</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">and someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really about balance</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">and about and about</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">i mean unity but leadership and teamwork</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">um effectively yeah and leadership</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">not just in the political realm right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s you know i&#39;ve i&#39;ve met more leaders</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">in the last three weeks than in probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">entire life uh interacting with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">and you know the the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">that get on board that i&#39;ve seen</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">and protect each other uh in</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">through afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">all right i want to try a formulation</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">out on you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">when when the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">situation happened to heather and me</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">we were asked to reflect on it many many</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">times by many different people and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">became clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">that there were a few things that were</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">the key lessons</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">the one that maybe is most prominent in</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">is crisis reveals everyone&#39;s character</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">for both better and worse i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">who you would absolutely think would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">courageous fold</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">and display pure cowardice and i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">people that you wouldn&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">had uh heroic courage within them</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">display it and the sense is there was</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">nobody left</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">on the sidelines afterward because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">crisis forced everybody to reveal which</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">of those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">resided within them and i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">if we can go back a little bit to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">conversation we were having 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">a crisis and thinking it&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">and seeing a national crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">involves us all only one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">produces</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">the reaction to crisis that will tell us</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">who you really are right until you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">actually it&#39;s crisis either way we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:40.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">because people are telling themselves oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.000" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">it&#39;s very simple you just do this you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">you know pull the lever for these people</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">so i guess what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">the unity movement is composed of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">who have seen the full crisis early</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">and reacted with courage rather than</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">and what i&#39;m hoping is that however it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">as the crisis reveals itself as it</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">becomes impossible to deny</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">that there is no safe answer here that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">both answers are dangerous in different</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to get um a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">destructive outcome</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">in either case as that reveals itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">people&#39;s character will also and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:29.839" style="s2">i think the point is it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">unity</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">or not it&#39;s unity now or</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">when you finally get around to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">recognizing how much danger we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">for for the courageous people i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of it at some point</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">you&#39;re going to break free from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.000" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">narrative you&#39;ve been told is right</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">you have to choose this side because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">other side is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">is the hazard</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">and i would imagine that a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">viewers right now and especially people</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">on democracy ai</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">are these courageous patriots who want</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">to know what they can do and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">going to do it and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">questions that we&#39;re getting on</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">democracy ai</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">are about strategy and numbers and where</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">we are right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">and um i think that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">important to reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">i know we keep saying it like broken</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">records but the ground swell</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">is hugely important to our success</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">and so strategies around that we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">cooking them they are on the way and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">also it begins with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">and it begins with and it begins with</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">the people that you can tell the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">that you can convince that something is</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">really wrong and that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">um and something else brett that uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">a lot of people are asking is have we</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">spoken to the candidates</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">who are who have been nominated and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fair question because we</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">need to know</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">you know how how viable are these</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">candidates and in the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">show we talked about the political</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">coming out in favor of unity or not and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">if you know if if anyone did that now it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">would almost be like</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">political suicide so um if we could</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">speak a little bit about that and about</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">our candidates and how how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">communicating with them and if we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">i think the audience would like to know</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">sure um</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">so let me say we have not sought the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">candidates out it&#39;s too early we need a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">groundswell</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">that&#39;s really on the public um i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">say who we have and have not spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">but i can say there has not been</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">a systematic effort to talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">who have been nominated because at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">what this is is um we are building</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">to a draft and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">i believe everyone on the list that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">was advanced the list of six would take</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">the job if we could provide a path to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">um and they would do so on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:48.079" style="s2">that they clearly</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">are patriotic they love their country</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.079" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">they understand the importance</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">of this nation to the functioning of the</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">you should have no you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">something smart</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">all right so um here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:58.319" style="s2">there is organic skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.079" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">and there is cultivated skepticism of</p>

<p begin="00:57:04.079" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">can work and this is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">incorrect but people have accepted it</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">and they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">understood that to play with things</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.880" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">outside of the mainstream offerings</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">is to invite ridicule and stigma</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">and you know many will remember</p>

<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">obviously one that had no basis in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">reality but the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">to tar her with the same brush that had</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">been used</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">my feeling is this should have been 2016</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">this is a disaster already well underway</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:34.799" style="s2">uh joining unity 2020 or becoming public</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">about your skepticism about the major</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.799" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">party offerings</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">then what we can say is</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a very vibrant group of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">who have already</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:50.079" style="s2">forged this path and are um</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">not going to accept blame in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">think the point is</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">we are trying to avert the disaster that</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">is coming</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">and the disaster belongs squarely at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">feet of people who did nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.760" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">so it is quite the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">stigmatizing story that has been</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">advertised to you</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">and i think we should just make no bones</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">jump on in the water&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">the water&#39;s fine it&#39;s going to boil but</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not there yet</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">and when we asked our audience about</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">what they can do to increase</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">um to increase our support uh the top</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">was to have conversations about uw 2020</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">with friends and family</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">this person has plenty of friends from</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">all over the spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s really important to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">is that you do have friends and family</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">from all different political walks of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">life and what do you love to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">have thanksgiving dinner and not</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">really be super stressed about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">that that&#39;s gonna happen um not too</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">sorry not to trigger anyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">but another thing that people um</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:58.559" style="s2">that that people are saying is is</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">posting on social media and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:00.240" style="s2">something that we haven&#39;t quite touched</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.760" end="01:01:02.720" style="s2">on yet</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.240" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">is is the power of social media and how</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.720" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">it can be</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">a powerful tool and also hugely</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">detrimental i think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:10.240" style="s2">echo chambers are keeping us all from</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">each other you know they&#39;re the caves</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.240" end="01:01:14.960" style="s2">that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">it&#39;s really stepping outside of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.960" end="01:01:18.559" style="s2">and sharing messages that maybe people</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">in your newsfeed have never seen</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.559" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">people in your timeline have never seen</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">um i think is really important and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">we do have tons of content that we would</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">love for you to share we&#39;re sharing with</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">you all the time on twitter and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">instagram</p>

<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:46.559" style="s2">we get the word out and this is how we</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">increase our support</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.559" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">and we and we&#39;re glad that you recognize</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">that these are the modes that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">doing it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">yeah i if i could riff on that just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">tiny bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">um social media is great</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s also part of the engine that</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">got us to where we are</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">right those echo chambers um to your</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">point elizabeth</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">what i would suggest is get to know your</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">neighbors again</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">get to know the people that are within</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">200 feet of you</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">90 99 of your day that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">you might not even know their names</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">the sort of direction that the country</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:30.200" style="s2">has been going with depersonalization</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.200" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">commodification of of uh of every</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">um those one-on-one conversations like</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard number one to get out</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">of the echo chamber and number two</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">that the thing that you brett we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">whatever that social force is that says</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:53.039" style="s2">oh if i&#39;m going to think outside the box</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:56.720" style="s2">the room is going to punish me right</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:03:00.079" style="s2">a one-on-one conversation isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.720" end="01:03:01.680" style="s2">is way safer than you think it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">because if you go into a one-on-one</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.680" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">conversation with a thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">with psychologically that you&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">the gun of the group</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">the same person who might join in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">taunting and mocking and saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:15.760" style="s2">impossible or that&#39;s harmful don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">dare do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.760" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">in the group context approaching them as</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">an individual</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:25.599" style="s2">you can actually get them to leave</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">the script right because the script is</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.599" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">provided</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">by the group of 30 and they they invent</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">it on the fly or</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">it emerges as some sort of multi-person</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">uh emergent script right but a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">one-on-one conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:46.079" style="s2">it&#39;s actually remarkably easy to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">those if you remember how</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.079" end="01:03:50.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re both even aside from unity</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re great for your psychological</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">well-being to actually have those</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:04:01.839" style="s2">one-on-one interactions with people and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:04.960" style="s2">they are the most genuine</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:07.200" style="s2">and most effective way to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.960" end="01:04:09.599" style="s2">connect with people and convince them</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.200" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">and even be convinced</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s the the high ideal of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">negotiation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">looking for in our eventual ticket and</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">also looking for in our nation&#39;s culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">so start to embody that right away and</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">and uh i want to add two things because</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">i do think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">there&#39;s all the difference in the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">between trying to do this in person</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">or at least personally with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:38.240" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">where everything you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">broadcast and it produces the expected</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">reaction</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:46.160" style="s2">one thing is that you will be shocked at</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">how frequently</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">somebody is harboring similar thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">but isn&#39;t saying so because of what they</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:56.160" style="s2">fear</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">so i live in portland as you many of you</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.160" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">will know</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">and when i interact with people i am</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:03.520" style="s2">very careful</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:05.839" style="s2">not to nod along to</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.520" end="01:05:07.520" style="s2">the conventional wisdom of the left</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">which is obviously very prevalent here</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.520" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">in portland</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">but here&#39;s the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">this has never gone bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.079" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">never once where if</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">somebody voices an opinion</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:27.039" style="s2">it&#39;s very frequent that i have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">different opinion that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.039" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">contradicts the conventional wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">i&#39;m very careful to see if i can say it</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">in such a way that it can be heard</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">and it is amazing how frequently</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">what happens is somebody will say one of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">the standard things that you say</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">nowadays</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">and i will say you know i don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:48.880" style="s2">that way here&#39;s how i see it</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">and then what comes back is oh me too i</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.880" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">also have a suspicion that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">quite right it&#39;s that or the other way</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">literally this has never once gone badly</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:00.880" style="s2">and so what i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:02.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a skill it&#39;s very often that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.880" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">both of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.000" end="01:06:06.240" style="s2">standard viewpoints are just wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">there&#39;s some viewpoint that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.240" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">approximately right</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily in the middle but</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s composed of different stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:15.119" style="s2">right so you know for example you will</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.119" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">from some people very often on the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:22.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">uh covet 19 is much less serious</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.400" end="01:06:25.760" style="s2">than we thought that it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">a flu at worst</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.760" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">right and you will hear people on</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">the left typically talking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">uh the numbers of people who are dying</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">from it and the you know the massive</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:41.200" style="s2">death toll already and so what i</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.720" style="s2">frequently say to people is you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.200" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">it&#39;s much less deadly</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.720" end="01:06:48.799" style="s2">than we feared and much more destructive</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:49.680" style="s2">right you can&#39;t hear that as one or the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.799" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">other because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">either of them the idea that fewer</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">people are dying but more of the people</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:56.480" style="s2">who are recovering</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:58.839" style="s2">are actually permanently damaged that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.480" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">that is something you have to engage</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.839" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">consciously and actively because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.119" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">not of some known</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">stripe so my point is on virtually</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:11.200" style="s2">every issue there&#39;s some way of not</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">being seen by the person you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.200" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:16.319" style="s2">as simply part of that group that they</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:18.319" style="s2">dislike and distrust</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.319" end="01:07:20.160" style="s2">and if you can figure out how to say</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">things such that you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.160" end="01:07:23.440" style="s2">immediately categorized as oh another</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:25.359" style="s2">one of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:27.520" style="s2">you know maga hat wearing or another one</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.359" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">of those black lives matter this that or</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">if you can just stay out of those traps</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">then you can have the conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">ryan is suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">that you have and you&#39;ll be amazed at um</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">a how wonderful it is to discover that</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">those conversations can be had</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">even with strangers and b how much more</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">progress you&#39;re likely to make in</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">convincing people that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">to be done</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:57.440" style="s2">all right i agree and let me just let me</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:01.360" style="s2">yet but i really really really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.679" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">want to vote for so i really really</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.360" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">really want to vote for a ticket that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.199" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">not devoured by corruption</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a pretty salient uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">wonderful keeping keeping an open mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">and understanding that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">where where we&#39;re at well i think this</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">is another it&#39;s another thing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:20.080" style="s2">uh unity has really accomplished already</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:23.440" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.080" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">um you know the fact of the obvious</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.440" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">corruption of these parties</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">has been difficult to talk about right</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency to want to see them</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:31.679" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.280" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">somewhat corrupt and i think they have</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.679" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">revealed themselves as much more corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">and to the extent that we can now talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:40.640" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.400" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">in the open that is progress of an</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.640" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">important kind because really the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">question is until that problem is solved</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:48.400" style="s2">we face the same issue and we will</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">continue to face it</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.400" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">every election so uh hence</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">unity all right so</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">i think we should close this out here um</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:00.800" style="s2">before we do that we should alert you</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">is um a</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t exactly know how to describe it</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">there is something unfolding in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2">aftermath of this campfire</p>
