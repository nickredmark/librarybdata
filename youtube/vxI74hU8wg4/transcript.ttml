<p begin="00:28:56.780" end="00:29:01.580" style="s2">common so the part I&#39;m responding to is</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.320" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">get a question from you is there a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.169" end="00:31:14.990" style="s2">way to sense when it&#39;s time to move</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">forward with the lessons how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.990" end="00:31:19.309" style="s2">when to learn a new meditation skill</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:21.190" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.309" end="00:31:27.169" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.190" end="00:31:31.389" style="s2">so generally the way you know when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.169" end="00:31:39.019" style="s2">time to move forward is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.389" end="00:31:39.799" style="s2">the previous skill is no longer putting</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.019" end="00:31:42.220" style="s2">you into the zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.799" end="00:31:46.129" style="s2">development it&#39;s no longer sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.220" end="00:31:48.529" style="s2">giving you a significant challenge</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.129" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">that&#39;s generally this where you can say</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.529" end="00:31:55.220" style="s2">I could do this and the rate of learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:56.659" style="s2">you&#39;ll still always learn I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.220" end="00:31:59.059" style="s2">what I just said but if it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.659" end="00:32:01.639" style="s2">like the rate of learning is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.059" end="00:32:04.700" style="s2">go down that generally means that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.639" end="00:32:06.679" style="s2">time to move on to the next skill try</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.700" end="00:32:08.389" style="s2">and explore it now if when you move</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.679" end="00:32:10.610" style="s2">there together you start to lose your</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.389" end="00:32:12.139" style="s2">previous skills that&#39;s premature so</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.610" end="00:32:14.779" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to hit this sweet spot if</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.139" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">you go and now when you start a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.779" end="00:32:18.049" style="s2">skill you always get what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:20.029" style="s2">utilization deficiency initially your</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.049" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">performance will degree so you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.029" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">give a little bit of time for that bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:25.220" style="s2">but if after you&#39;ve given it quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:27.740" style="s2">of time you still feel fine like your</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.220" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">previous skills are being degraded then</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.740" end="00:32:31.940" style="s2">that means it&#39;s premature go back we</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:34.220" style="s2">gather right and if you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.940" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s okay the challenge the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.220" end="00:32:39.110" style="s2">learning is dropping now I try again</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.000" style="s2">initially I don&#39;t make any judgments</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.110" end="00:32:43.220" style="s2">because it&#39;s utilization deficiency I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.000" end="00:32:46.100" style="s2">wait and see you know they give it a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.220" end="00:32:49.850" style="s2">week or so but and then oh now this time</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.100" end="00:32:51.890" style="s2">now my old skill the old my older skills</p>
