<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know anyone i i had this</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">moment where like i kind of knew one guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">in the city</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">and we were gonna go out and i was all</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">night as an adult in new york city</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">and he totally ghosted on me and i had</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">no one to hang out with</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">and just the feeling in my body in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">moment of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">i&#39;m alone here i have no support i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">people was terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">and i kind of vowed to myself i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">let anyone make me feel that way again</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">like make me feel that way again</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:57.599" style="s2">and just dedicated a year of my life to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">really finding who my people are because</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">i realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">i never really felt at home in a group</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:04.720" style="s2">of friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">and like the people around me lifted me</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.720" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">up and helped me become a better version</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">of me</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">i i was a comedy kid in college</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">and so is like in the sketch comedy</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">improv world</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">was like the president of my school&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">improv group</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">and looking back i realized we were all</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">kind of using</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">humor as a way to denigrate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">take each other down a notch and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t very kind and i wanted to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">who who were kinder than that and when i</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">started to find those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">intersected with when donald trump was</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">elected</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">in and so my newsletter actually started</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">november and 2016</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">because there was a juxtaposition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">feeling like for me things were hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">i heard my friends saying things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">people are bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">i can&#39;t trust anyone anymore like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">things are hopeless that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">at the same time being around the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">loving inspiring people i&#39;d ever met</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">and i wanted to let people know that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">new york city</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">every day of the week there&#39;s these</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">and what happened then and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll wrap up my story is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">that people started coming up to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">once i released this newsletter and</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know other people felt that way</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">i started getting emails from strangers</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">who didn&#39;t even live in new york city</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">like i just got divorced and i&#39;m with my</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:50.479" style="s2">kids and i don&#39;t know how to meet people</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">the more i learned and as i decided to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">write a book on loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s such a common human experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">that we feel such</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">deep shame around and that we really</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">just need to talk about it and voice it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">share how we can step out of our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">loneliness if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">because sometimes loneliness can be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">really beautiful powerful feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that&#39;s my whole deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what i&#39;ve dedicated my</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">life to is just creating</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">community and connection because we we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">really</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">where do you think that shame comes from</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">um i mean so for me and this is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">discussed discussed very publicly but i</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">come from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">pretty dysfunctional family and if</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in any sort of 12-step</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">group or sitting in the in the chat me</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">too we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">yeah when we really look at it most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">us come from dysfunctional families a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">lot of people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">talk about it um but the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">three rules of a dysfunctional family is</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">don&#39;t talk don&#39;t trust don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">like don&#39;t talk don&#39;t trust don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">those are kind of the three pillars</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">and so for me since feeling disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">is tied with sadness it&#39;s tied</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">with kind of like maybe anger</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">like these feelings that are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">acceptable in a lot of households to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">talk about you kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">shove that down and put on a smile be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">good girl everything&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">pleasantness in here</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">uh i think that&#39;s where the shame comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious um for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">the question of a gender divide came up</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">to mind when i was reading some of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">do you think women experience loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">in a different way than men do</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">i okay i&#39;m just gonna answer this off</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">the cuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">um this isn&#39;t something i&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">talked about very much but what just</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">immediately popped to the top of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">was that in my experience of working</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">with women</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">um the loneliness can come from not</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">feeling like their emotional selves are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">fully expressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">that in my own experience it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">realizing i had no place to express rage</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">grief or like these deep emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">make up part of who i</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">am that there were not safe spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">to share those feelings and so i as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">person did not feel fully expressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m actually i&#39;m in a women&#39;s group</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">now where that is the point is to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like community therapy with</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">each other where we&#39;re always expressing</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">these things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">socially we&#39;re told to not express a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">of the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">and with men i think that is also true</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">of your full emotional self isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">expressed there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">maybe a little different flavor of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">i know</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">with a lot of guys there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">difficult time with even asking men to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">hang out in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">and really this is just the thing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">people but this is what i&#39;ve heard from</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">women i&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">they&#39;ll say something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">like can you just tell my husband that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to ask a guy to go get tacos</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">with him</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">like that there&#39;s a block of even asking</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">guys to hang out with you in the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">um in very broad strokes and also i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">seeing in the comments grown men don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">cry</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">each other and support each other look</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">at what they can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s more work than you could do in</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">years with a therapist because</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">at least in my opinion it&#39;s healing done</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">in community with other men</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">and the same applies to women when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">know that you can trust women</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">and you can show these things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">more than you can just do with one</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">person like it&#39;s a whole different type</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">of healing</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">yeah yeah and then that&#39;s what i echo</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">those thoughts of that documentary is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">really good um</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve done a lot of like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">similar encounter work and somatic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">and kind of psychotherapeutic work and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">feel like i can</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">have good homosocial relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">men and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">but i i do think i&#39;ve never heard that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">before it&#39;s not my turn but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">uh meta term uh but um</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">i i do think there&#39;s like a uh what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:37.920" style="s2">call man box you know with male homo</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">social relationships where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.920" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">show weakness you can&#39;t show this</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">which is a barrier which engenders</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">loneliness um</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">but one thing that i&#39;m getting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">realize that a lot of women have</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">trouble making friends with other women</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">like my wife is jealous of my male</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">friends and how we can just bond</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">and then talk in like kind of a free</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">associative way and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">there seems to be barriers there so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">just want to double click on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">uh if there&#39;s any truth or any resonance</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">there in that statement</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">i like that i want to double click on it</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">um this is why i love joining different</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">communities because i get to hear like</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">the lingo that&#39;s totally common for</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">everyone and then i&#39;m like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">literally never heard someone say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">in my life so cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">i should apologize in advance before</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">there&#39;s so much lingo that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">walking into</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s so cool um</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">i think it can definitely be true and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">like the the women&#39;s group that i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">part of is called woman within and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">kind of the initiation into your women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">circle which is every week or every</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">other week is a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">long experience that i super recommend</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">post covent times um</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">but a gift of that is being able to hear</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">the struggles of a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">types of women and a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">stages in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">and i think like i</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">hearing a woman so openly just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i can trust other women</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">i i don&#39;t trust other women and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a thought i had ever</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">consciously had and yet because of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">like with with my sister with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">realizing that&#39;s it&#39;s definitely there</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not a thought i&#39;ve i&#39;ve consciously</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">thought before</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">there there&#39;s a really great book uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">i love that this is a space where it</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">feels like i can just go super deep and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">nerdy on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a book called the heroine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">which i really recommend for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">who&#39;s female identifying</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">and also considers yourself kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">a father&#39;s daughter</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">like someone who you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">please</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">your dad like there&#39;s a lot of uh like</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">you&#39;re his star you&#39;re his golden</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">child which is totally me</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">uh and it really sheds a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">painful uncomfortable amount of light on</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">why you might have perfectionist</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">tendencies why you might gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">more towards male friends than female</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">and like the the healing cycle of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s gorgeous and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">also totally not a light read so</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">warning on that but it&#39;s really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">that&#39;s cool um should be a stolen</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">uh that that journey so cool because</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s she&#39;s arguing that the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">journey is different than the heroine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">journey like the hero&#39;s journey is much</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">masculine like there&#39;s a goal and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">get to it and it&#39;s over and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">heroine&#39;s journey is much more cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">like a death and rebirth cycle</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a really great look at like oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">wow this</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">story structure that we just sew or i so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">just felt was true</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">like that&#39;s what it is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">completely different way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s more feminine leaning you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">someone in the comments being like over</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">and over</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">it keeps going forever right</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">so something else i wanted to um circle</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:16.959" style="s2">when you mention your improv i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">your acting uh experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because keith johnstone</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">kind of the pioneer of improv is coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">in tomorrow uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.079" style="s2">to at the stoa to do um a talk and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">spoke with them on the phone</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.079" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">uh last week and i have an improv</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">background as well and i didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">vibe with</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">i loved improv but i didn&#39;t vibe with</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">the people in improv because when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">hang out with them for beer it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">like they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">competing each other with jokes you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like can we just have like a real</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s like they gotta say</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">something i think i see something funny</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">and then the um that the whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">the sketch mentality because you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">hunting for the laugh and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">kind of like it&#39;s like a super normal</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">stimuli you get addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">it and then you just kind of mold your</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">character around that and uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s funny that keith was say it again</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like um a display or some</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">device that captures an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">adaptive thing and then heightens it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">like porn is a super normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">for example or laugh tracks and comedy</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">shows as a super normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">and uh anyway so keith johnson was was</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">making fun of this too but i was like on</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">the phone which is quite awesome uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">and so what i mentioned that is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">there seems to be like a narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">component there it&#39;s like pointing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">finger back on me</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing that and that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">of like anti-community</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">uh so i&#39;m curious if you can tease out</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">some of the characteristics between</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">these sort of anti-communities</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">and what you&#39;re cultivating their uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">with actual community</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">yeah well i mean even</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">for me someone who wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">book about community</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">there&#39;s just so many individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">tendencies in me</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">because of the culture i was raised in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">like living in america</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">very counter-intuitive for me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">act in community like it&#39;s such a muscle</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">and i feel like that muscle for me has</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">so deteriorated during this time of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">covid</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">um because i i tend to like to build</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">community by connecting people</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">and creating gatherings in person</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">and i don&#39;t really get to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">as much um there&#39;s there&#39;s a postcard on</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">my fridge that i&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">that a friend sent me that says how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">build community and then it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">of things and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">so many actions that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">do like talking to your neighbor making</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">food and giving people in your community</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">extra like working in a community garden</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">lists of things like that it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">like 50 things</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">tragic that we live in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">where there&#39;s so much hustle and grind</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">i was about to say being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">contribute to your community is a luxury</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually true i</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">think it more feels like a luxury like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">oh if i had more time i would totally</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">make brownies and gifts up to my</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">neighbors or like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">um i wish i had a better understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">capitalism and its impact on</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">individualism because i would have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">incorporated it more into my book</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">but that&#39;s just not my expertise so much</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">and and so when it comes to like the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">practical aspects uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">like with the joy list and the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing so how what are what</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">are the steps you have taken and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:59.760" style="s2">taking to build community development</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">well it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">i&#39;m so aware of the irony of everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">that i do</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">that my newsletter is to help people</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">find their community i would not argue</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">that my newsletter is a community</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:15.840" style="s2">like it is me telling other people where</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">they can go</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">to find their community uh i would not</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">say that my newsletter is a community</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">like if someone told me that my</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">newsletter was their community i would</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">concerned because it&#39;s just one woman</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">sending a bunch of people an email every</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">week like it&#39;s not even very interactive</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">um i used to have in-person events</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">called the joyless social where it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">the whole point was you come to this</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">event alone</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">so you can meet other people in new york</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">city who want to make friends</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s like such a sweet space and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">miss it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">uh and i would think that was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">because if there is a volunteer there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">a bunch of volunteers there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">volunteer coordinator</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">there&#39;s people who show up every time</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">there&#39;s people who want to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">like there&#39;s musicians who come</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">and even then it&#39;s like it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">thing that if i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">make it happen it wouldn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">uh and so i struggle with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">of hoping that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">find their their network of friends</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">while also realizing the thing that i am</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">offering is not really</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">in alignment with those values so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">and what i&#39;m getting is you&#39;re like a a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">community matchmaker</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">like instead of matching people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">matchmaking communities together forming</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">yeah this guy sent me an email yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">where he was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">what did he say he said um he&#39;s like i</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">refer to you as community goddess</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">like you&#39;re the person who like brings</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">people to where they need to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">but you&#39;re not the like you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">which i&#39;ll totally take that title</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">and uh so the last question i&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">then we can pivot to the chats and feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">free to ask us any um any questions as</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">uh this is kind of related to store two</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">since kovit came along this is the title</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">i think i&#39;ll actually talk community</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">coved what is your sense of online</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">communities forming</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">and how are they different from</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:25.919" style="s2">in-person communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">well it&#39;s really interesting because i</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.919" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">so i have a bias</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">of being someone who&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">ambivert like i</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">i do get energy from people but only a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">very specific type of person and i need</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">alone to recharge uh you&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">assume i&#39;m the most extroverted person</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">in the history of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">uh but i</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">i have a newsletter with a curated type</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">of event because i&#39;m only energized by a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">certain type of space</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">like if you drop me into a networking</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">event with no facilitation like i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">want to die</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">and run away um i see it laura&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">totally relate to that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">and but at the same time i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">completely introverted</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a bias that i have that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">need to remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">and i&#39;ve heard from people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">organizing very consistent online spaces</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">that they&#39;ve actually had more people</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">show up than they&#39;ve ever had at their</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">in-person events</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">and people are more engaged and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">part of that is because</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">since we&#39;re behind our computer screens</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">and if i wanted to i could just</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">literally close my laptop and all of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">potentially depending on my personality</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">i could be more vulnerable more present</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">more open with all of you here</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">than i could be at an in-person</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">gathering</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">and that that&#39;s actually an unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">gift for a lot of community leaders to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">see like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">people are even more invested there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">more types of people showing up</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">than ever before my church is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">the same way more people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">like attending services online</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">than they did in person and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">an interesting thing to consider and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">i i notice people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">community space are</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s so easy to just [ __ ] on virtual</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">gatherings</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">when there are some really beautiful</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">grounded</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">which is a four-day digital detox</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">summer camp for adults so it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a sober space you use like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">silly name</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">instead of your real name my name was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">lady</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">uh and even though it was only</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">four days the experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">completely shifted my perception of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">was possible in terms of relating</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">because it was the first space i&#39;d ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">been in where</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">like it was it was first of all curated</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">so much to be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">to show up here you have to be the type</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">of adult who is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">not talk about work use a silly name be</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">sober</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">not have your phone with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">people in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">and so that was kind of a gate already</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">and to see like these are adults who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">open so playful and i</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">bonded with these people in four days</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">more than i had bonded with friends in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">like no joke and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">so on the one hand that&#39;s so beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">because it was such a short amount of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">time and such an intensity of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">and bonding and yet at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">because there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">a um like some sort of campgrounded</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">event series outside of the space</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">the the friendships start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">dwindle a little bit over time if</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">something that an organizer is putting</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">and so i wish sometimes like i see these</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">gorgeous retreats that people host where</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">like people</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">bond and they&#39;re opening their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s like incredible</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">and then cut to a year later and those</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">people aren&#39;t talking anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">nothing has been organized to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">together again</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">uh and i wish that more people did that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">especially retreats were very like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.559" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">you&#39;re really vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">like i&#39;ve been in retreats where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">like our souls just got busted open</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">and now we&#39;re just back</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">in our lives with like no form of coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">back together</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">or checking in with each other uh it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">feels almost irresponsible a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">so i wish people did a better job of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">i hope that answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">do you have any follow-up also i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">curious if you&#39;re in ireland</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">that i find something similar that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">follow-up stuff</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">like an event can crash</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">things together and then it&#39;s about just</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">maintaining it and recently</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">some chats with friends have been the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">idea that you can actually be friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">with almost anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">because the friendship thing is almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">just we&#39;ve been through stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">together so you don&#39;t need to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have shared interest you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">just need to have shared kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">homeless memories and my best friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">are the longest ones not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">the most intense events or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">that and the follow-up is something</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">that really helps with that personally</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">like american-style meetups based around</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">mutual interest for example you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">bowling alone idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">bowling together in the in the 50s and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">and community in mediterranean cultures</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">such as greece</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">italy spain portugal are there deeper</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:07.039" style="s2">skills and ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">that cultivate community that are</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">when our social culture is so around</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">gathering around is shared interest</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">versus just getting together for meals</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">and hanging out</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper substratum to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.799" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">particularly mediterranean cultures</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">that is like a glue that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">and he said how much he missed just how</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">normal it was for people to just spend</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">the whole day hanging out together</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">like it wasn&#39;t it didn&#39;t feel like a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">deal it didn&#39;t feel like a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">to just be like hey man you want to walk</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">over to my house and we&#39;ll just like</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">in the united states it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">that that feels intimidating even to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">to be like want to just hang out all day</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">and i think there is something very</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">missing of one being able to be okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">without a plan first of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">like engage in a conversation for that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.799" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">and to not have this i think the problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">is this anxious</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">like monster that&#39;s hanging out that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">that&#39;s just murdering this joy we get</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">in being with people for long amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">and so that that&#39;s what i see and it</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">connecting people with communities where</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">they have a lot of options right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">new york city you can go</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">find a community for any little thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">you want and i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">dan&#39;s question sort of touched on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">or you sort of touched on this and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">your answer to dan&#39;s question were like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">you&#39;re all hanging hanging out around</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">like a mutual interest</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">um so like i wonder what your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">are on the differences</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:18.839" style="s2">between like building communities where</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">people have self-selected to be there</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">versus um strengthening</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">a community that you are for lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">better term stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">like your family or neighbors or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">you live in a small town or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">um and if you have any advice that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned in your experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">could be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">that kind of situation versus hey we all</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">and especially like um</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">you said like campgrounded people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">very playful and open and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">a lot of sort of you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">festival we met up people have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:55.200" style="s2">shared openness and vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">how would you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">sort of bring that environment into</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">places where people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">self-selected around those values</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">this is a super great question like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">how can you just be with people and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">appreciate them</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">versus having to like always be in</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">spaces where you know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">certain set of norms that like are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">for you um and honestly this is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">part of my work right now is like</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:29.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a big reason why i like i said i</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">have a newsletter that&#39;s around a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.440" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">type of event because i&#39;m i&#39;m such a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">sensitive person</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">that it really means a lot to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">in a space where i feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">held and like everyone&#39;s on the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">page</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">and so for me my work is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">like just be curious about anyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">and this has come up a lot with people</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">asking like i&#39;ve been with the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">people during covet and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">so sick of them like i&#39;m sick of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">family i&#39;m sick of my partner or</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">like what do i do and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">the biggest learning i&#39;ve had which</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">might sound obvious is to just</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">be genuinely curious about them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">and that you learn new things about</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">people when you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">new questions and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">like an example in my life that ties to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">i was in texas over the summer and there</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">were some people we were hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">who were like in our pod that would not</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">like my first choice of friends in new</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">york city</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">and i felt a lot of resistance around</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">that and like a lot of resentment around</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">and realized first of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">these people are definitely picking up</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">on that that is my attitude towards them</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">like they probably don&#39;t want to be open</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">and vulnerable with me if i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">coming in all judgy about who they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">uh and i i started asking one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">guys we were in a car ride</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">about this video game that he loves like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">it was like this kind of horror video</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">game like why he loved it so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">and he gave me the most profound</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">beautiful answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">about how he loves like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">step into the lives of different women</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">in the game different characters</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">experiencing the world through that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">playing different</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">teams and i</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">was just so struck by his answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">i was judging as like a waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">and like stupid</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">and here he was having this gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">experience with it and i just hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">opened myself up enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">to to have a connected experience with</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">and so i think just for anyone if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">and you really love being in spaces with</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">your people because</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">you probably grew up in a family where</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">you didn&#39;t feel like they were your</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">you grew up in a high school where you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel like you had your people</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">and so now as an adult you&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">holding</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">dearly to these spaces where you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">just be you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">uh to just bring that curiosity to folks</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">who aren&#39;t like in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">little bubble universe because</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been really fun for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">recently to be talking to people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">have world views that are very different</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">than mine like i&#39;ve been really working</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">to talk to more people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">republicans who are conservative who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">trump voters</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">who are way older than me like those are</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">those are the people i&#39;m working to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">bring into my world</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">so i can practice that of just learning</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">through curiosity and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s my offering around that question</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.359" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">sensitivity of you know you and i sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">of feel the same way i like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">being in a space with friends where i</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">can sort of talk the way i want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s difficult to sort of have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">curious mindset especially around</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">um you know people where family where i</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">have history with</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">and one one phrase that came to mind um</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">a friend of mine who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">uh hit one of his phrases he&#39;s coined is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">more curious</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">less afraid so i wonder what you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">wait my perception is that like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">some type of fear that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">prevents us from being curious</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">you agree with or what what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">is preventing</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">you or people in general to carry that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">disposition of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">i&#39;m like wiggling because i&#39;m so excited</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">about this question</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">uh so like context i just finished this</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">seven</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">week course on emotional equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">in conversations across lines of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">like how can you speak to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">sees the world very differently than you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">and like keep your cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">and stay curious and open and not close</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">or explode</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">and a big point the teacher harry</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">pickens made was</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">we often don&#39;t put ourselves with people</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">who hold very different world views</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">because we&#39;re afraid of our minds being</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">like that point blew my mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">like oh maybe part of me unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">is avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">talking to people who support trump</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">talking to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">really republican because i might see</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">something about myself that i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:01.599" style="s2">i might want to shift a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">if i want to do that then who am i</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.599" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">like that&#39;s really scary and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">to like the the work is to go into these</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">conversations knowing like</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">this person might change the way i see</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:22.400" style="s2">and to not because people sense it if</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">you&#39;re like holding on to your ideology</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">so tight like i do this when i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">into a conversation with the trump voter</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re stupid and bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">no one&#39;s going to be open with me if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">coming in with that mindset</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">like no one&#39;s going to want to share</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">their heart with me if i&#39;m not willing</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">even hear where they&#39;re genuinely coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s been a big shift for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">in being with people across lines of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">difference is realizing like</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid that&#39;s what this is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">afraid of this person</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">uh so how do you deal with that the uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">triggers um</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">because you know uh across the political</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">spectrum people are getting triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">liberals people getting triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">um and then they can feel that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">like a mirror neurons fire like they</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">feel that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t like the person um and so how</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">do you do that internal sort of like jiu</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">jitsu moves in order to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">not allow that to affect the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:28.839" style="s2">like first of all shout out to harry</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">pickens he&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">um he</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">really suggested first of all like</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">there we would always do this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">of on the one hand on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">and we would like literally use our</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">hands uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">to show that like nothing is ever one</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s such i&#39;ve been told this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">like a white thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how it&#39;s true but maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">i&#39;m assuming it is of the like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">very black or white like it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">this way or it&#39;s this way and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">nothing in between</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">uh to realize that like with every bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">thing that happens that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">something that&#39;s in on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">uh i&#39;m trying to think of an example</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">when i&#39;m feeling self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">like on the one hand our schooling</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">completely messed up how we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">columbus</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">on the other hand now we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">really rich conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">how we need to redefine how we teach and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">like why that&#39;s happened in the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">like yes this shitty thing&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">on for forever</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">and now we have this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">opportunity to change the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">like something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">so that was one thing uh and we we also</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">talk about historical paradox</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">of how oh i know i notice i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">nervous while</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">i&#39;m sharing this like i want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">really right um</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">but how if you focus on</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">just the bad in our history</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">you actually like you aren&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">you aren&#39;t in your full truth like</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not really seeing clearly</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">or you could be very pollyannaish and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">like only look at the beautiful positive</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:20.839" style="s2">things in our history and to realize</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s good and bad in</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.839" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">everything and to be able to hold both</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">of those truths and have like the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">to hold both of those truths at the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">because like you see in the news</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very tilted towards like everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">is bad and on fire and exploding and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">like you should be screaming your head</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:43.599" style="s2">off right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">when like there are really gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">things happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">like on the one hand covet is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s made us realize how terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">our leadership is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">on the other hand people are supporting</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">each other and realizing beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">things about how their lives aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">way they want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">and thinking about community support</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">uh so these are all kind of mindset</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">things and in terms of like actual your</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">being um one big thing is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">training your breath like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.839" style="s2">breathe deeply</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">because if anyone here has anxiety you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">quick shallow breathing will make our</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">nervous systems freak out like our</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">we&#39;re not able to think as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">uh what harry says is stress makes us</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">stupid</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">like the more charged up you are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">clearly you are able to think which</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">totally makes sense and so how can we</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">train our nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">to be calmer in moments of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">and that could look like doing more</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">breath work meditating more</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">just having a constant check-in practice</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">of how deep am i breathing right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in my body uh he would</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">always have us on zoom</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">just like take breaks to yawn and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">stretch because yawning calms her body</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:07.119" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">so like real pretty on whatever but we</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.119" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">were just always just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">stretching on um</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s some stuff that&#39;s some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">i&#39;m using all my stoic</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.400" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">willpower to not yawn right now so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">um yeah so yeah you&#39;re going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">um so we have some good questions uh</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">question hannah</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">hi jillian so i have</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">a question surrounding friendships</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">my question is how do you know if</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">someone is your friend</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:52.560" style="s2">and i&#39;ll contextualize this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">uh i find i&#39;m often in situations</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.560" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">where uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">like a work situation i&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">someone is being friendly out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">convenience</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">or because they actually like me so</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">things like that make me wonder</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">well i guess if you&#39;re okay with me</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">about romantic relationships and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.839" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">for good reason</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">which means i feel like this is a word</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">is very simple um but it means like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">culture that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">puts romance first that says like</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">romantic love is the pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">a modern normativity i used it in a ton</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">of time so i can sound very smart</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">um but it&#39;s true that it&#39;s like oh my</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">that&#39;s so not true but that&#39;s what our</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">culture teaches us</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">this is my long rant hope it was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:55.359" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s reminding me actually of uh esther</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">and now all of those roles are placed</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.680" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">all of that on one person</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">it&#39;s also not fun to put all of that on</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if this might be the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">next step in the game of social</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:47.760" style="s2">cohesion and reliance</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.559" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">time of change</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">and the idea of values has been so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">on my mind and something i&#39;m hearing a</p>
