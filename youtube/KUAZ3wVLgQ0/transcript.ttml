<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">connected earlier I guess we did</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">actually connect many years ago but you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">know we kind of travel in similar</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.859" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">zach is now the third Hampshire College</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">Grad I&#39;ve had on my show the statistical</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">unlikeliness of that is really unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">the first one was least small on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">physicist I don&#39;t remember who the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">second one was if I remember pointing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">out that it was statistically unusual to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">have two and now we have three something</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">interesting about Hampshire College</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">after Hampshire College Zach studied</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">calm let&#39;s start with the title I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:09.860" style="s2">usually don&#39;t talk about the title much</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">but the title I thought was a vaca t&#39;v</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.860" end="00:02:16.569" style="s2">education in a time between world</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:21.160" style="s2">could you unpack time between worlds a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.569" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">little bit totally yeah I did a basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.160" end="00:02:27.459" style="s2">idea I mean it&#39;s a few things combined</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:29.410" style="s2">you know one of them is just actually a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.459" end="00:02:32.530" style="s2">very theoretical idea from the field of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.410" end="00:02:34.450" style="s2">world Systems Theory which is founded by</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.530" end="00:02:36.610" style="s2">Immanuel Wallerstein and he had this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.450" end="00:02:38.860" style="s2">notion that there were within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.610" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">history of the capitalist world system</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.860" end="00:02:47.080" style="s2">these periods when there were economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:49.060" style="s2">rollovers when basically the long time a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.080" end="00:02:52.540" style="s2">demonic force which dominated the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.060" end="00:02:55.600" style="s2">system goes into decay and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.540" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">kind of period where there&#39;s not a clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.600" end="00:03:01.180" style="s2">overarching order to the world system</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">until another one locks in and so these</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.180" end="00:03:04.930" style="s2">were world system transformations and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:08.410" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that these</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:11.739" style="s2">actually align historically in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.410" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2">the epochs with other models like models</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.739" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">from cultural evolution where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.140" end="00:03:20.049" style="s2">looking at the movement out of the you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:21.910" style="s2">know late pre-modern to the early modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.049" end="00:03:23.769" style="s2">and then from the early modern to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.910" end="00:03:26.049" style="s2">like mature modern and then for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.769" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">mature modern to the postmodern and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.049" end="00:03:29.650" style="s2">there&#39;s several different halls</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">including esoteric models from people</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.650" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">like Rudolf Steiner where you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:36.280" style="s2">at this notion that there are periods</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">when although we&#39;re still on the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.280" end="00:03:42.910" style="s2">earth we are moving to a different world</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:47.140" style="s2">and we are in one of those periods right</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.910" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">now and basically when you&#39;re in where</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.140" end="00:03:54.820" style="s2">those periods education itself becomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:57.989" style="s2">one of the primary vectors of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.820" end="00:04:00.730" style="s2">collapsing the new world into into order</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.989" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the way I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.730" end="00:04:05.980" style="s2">framing the educational thinking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:07.269" style="s2">doing in the book which is to say this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.980" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t the thinking I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.269" end="00:04:14.530" style="s2">doing back in like the 1950s or 60s let</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">alone 1890s or something like this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.530" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">the thinking you do when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">literally between worlds when you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">trying to reboot a very basic human</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:30.480" style="s2">for structure like a hard reboot and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">obviously you can see how this links</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">into the thinking around game B and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:38.070" style="s2">there&#39;s other groups that are holding</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:40.170" style="s2">similar notions so then that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.070" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">bit about that notion of the between</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.170" end="00:04:43.830" style="s2">worlds yeah we&#39;ll talk about that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">little bit later in fact and I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.830" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">point people to my essay in search of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">the fifth attractor which talks about</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.580" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">the fact that the ball is gonna fly out</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:54.480" style="s2">of our basin at some point and we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:56.670" style="s2">have a moral duty to make sure it lands</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.480" end="00:04:58.920" style="s2">in a good basin and not a bad one I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.670" end="00:05:01.350" style="s2">think we&#39;re all on the same mission here</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.920" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">essentially we&#39;re gonna start off again</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.350" end="00:05:05.390" style="s2">a little unusually because you use some</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:07.980" style="s2">terms which may not be generally</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.390" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">understood by folks in the wider world</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.980" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">by no means is all my audience the game</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">B world there&#39;s lots of academics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">businesspeople and just regular old</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">folks that listen one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">say is that you see the central</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">importance of education as an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:28.460" style="s2">the global meta crisis could you unpack</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:31.320" style="s2">the idea of meta-crisis a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.460" end="00:05:32.700" style="s2">totally so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.320" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">to think of it and there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.700" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">different people doing work on it so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:39.230" style="s2">gonna give my view you can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:43.370" style="s2">in a couple ways one is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.230" end="00:05:45.780" style="s2">many crises and if you so for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.370" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">there&#39;s something like an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.780" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">crisis right there&#39;s something like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:51.690" style="s2">geopolitical crisis there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:53.160" style="s2">like a local political crisis at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.690" end="00:05:54.480" style="s2">level of American democracy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.160" end="00:05:56.700" style="s2">something like a crisis in the schools</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.480" end="00:05:57.180" style="s2">and the health care so like take your</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.700" end="00:05:59.070" style="s2">pick</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.180" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">you could characterize the fields as</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.070" end="00:06:04.770" style="s2">crisis ridden and that&#39;s in part because</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:07.220" style="s2">of the time between worlds notion but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.770" end="00:06:10.950" style="s2">you take the kid all the crises combined</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.220" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">you get a super ordinate crisis which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.950" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">the meadow crisis you could think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:17.400" style="s2">that as potentially being distilled into</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">the generator function behind all of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.400" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">crises why are they all occurring but</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">you can also think of that meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:25.920" style="s2">as specifically educational which is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.700" end="00:06:29.580" style="s2">say if you&#39;re in the woods and you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.920" end="00:06:31.260" style="s2">lost that&#39;s a crisis and then if it gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.580" end="00:06:33.490" style="s2">cold and you have to make a fire that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.260" end="00:06:37.630" style="s2">another crisis if you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.490" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">make a fire but the meta-crisis there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.630" end="00:06:42.610" style="s2">actually your own mind it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">state of your skills and your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.610" end="00:06:49.660" style="s2">keep your head on your shoulders so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:53.819" style="s2">that&#39;s the crisis behind the crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.660" end="00:06:56.259" style="s2">so in a sense the educational crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.819" end="00:06:58.180" style="s2">pivotal within the broader meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.259" end="00:07:00.849" style="s2">because it&#39;s the one that gets at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.180" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">heart of the issue which is the nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.849" end="00:07:08.500" style="s2">of human choice making self</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:11.470" style="s2">understanding and capacity so when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.500" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">look at the situation I&#39;m seeing several</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.470" end="00:07:16.120" style="s2">things in that light you&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:17.560" style="s2">capabilities crisis which is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.120" end="00:07:20.020" style="s2">the things we need to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.560" end="00:07:21.789" style="s2">do who are not figuring out just jump in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.020" end="00:07:24.099" style="s2">and say essentially capability versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.789" end="00:07:26.409" style="s2">complexity problem right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.099" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">we actually have more capability now</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.409" end="00:07:30.430" style="s2">than we did in 1850 but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:32.759" style="s2">confronting a much more complex world so</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.430" end="00:07:36.220" style="s2">it&#39;s really a mismatch between</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.759" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">exponentially rising complexity and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.220" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">know probably also exponentially rising</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.490" style="s2">capability but rising on a lower</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:44.289" style="s2">exponential yeah that&#39;s right the we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.490" end="00:07:47.409" style="s2">we&#39;ve ended up building a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.289" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">where the the problems we&#39;re confronting</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.409" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">have become so complex so quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:54.699" style="s2">there&#39;s a lag in the human capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:56.590" style="s2">upgrade needed to meet them so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.699" end="00:07:58.810" style="s2">your classic that&#39;s one classic</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.590" end="00:08:01.539" style="s2">dimension of educational crisis as kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.810" end="00:08:04.090" style="s2">of the meta crisis here their capability</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.539" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">crisis but there&#39;s also a legitimation</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.090" end="00:08:08.550" style="s2">crisis right and this is also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:11.860" style="s2">dimension of the educational crisis</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.550" end="00:08:14.229" style="s2">which is to say that it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.860" end="00:08:16.150" style="s2">we can&#39;t figure stuff out from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.229" end="00:08:18.880" style="s2">capability to standpoint we can&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.150" end="00:08:20.469" style="s2">out who is the one with the legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">Authority even say they figured it out</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.469" end="00:08:24.490" style="s2">right so this is touching on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:26.310" style="s2">political crisis but it&#39;s even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.490" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s about the legitimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.310" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">authority period the lack of social</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:37.479" style="s2">cohesion or social capital you know is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">one of the very strong amplifiers of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.479" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">meta-crisis because obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:43.000" style="s2">undermines the ability to you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:44.380" style="s2">organize serious attacks on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">meta-crisis I mean just look at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.380" end="00:08:47.460" style="s2">clown-like response of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.380" style="s2">to the cover</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.460" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">virus you know compare and contrast was</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:55.530" style="s2">say our response to World War two or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:56.250" style="s2">Cuban Missile Crisis exactly and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.530" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at it from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.250" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">perspective of the schools that ship</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">sailed a long time ago there&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:03.390" style="s2">absence of legitimate teach really</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">Authority in the schools and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.390" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">universities for quite a while and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:13.560" style="s2">that is what has produced the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:17.070" style="s2">widespread sense of illegitimate across</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.560" end="00:09:18.960" style="s2">most of our major institutions so but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.070" end="00:09:20.940" style="s2">then you also have the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.960" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">which is adjacent to the legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.940" end="00:09:25.350" style="s2">crisis and the capability crisis which</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:27.140" style="s2">is basically what a lot of work for</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.350" end="00:09:30.090" style="s2">baekje talks about in others where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.140" end="00:09:31.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not just there&#39;s not legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.090" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">Authority and there&#39;s problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.770" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">too complex to solve there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">sense of we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:42.360" style="s2">as a species or a nation or even an</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:46.370" style="s2">individual what&#39;s the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.360" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">suffering what&#39;s the meaning of the joy</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.370" end="00:09:53.670" style="s2">what&#39;s the meaning of death sleep dreams</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.500" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2">there&#39;s such a dimension of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.670" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">incoherence here this is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">the conspiracy theory industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:04.020" style="s2">plugs into is the opening the question</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.020" end="00:10:09.630" style="s2">actual meaning and then the final ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.840" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">in intelligibility crisis which is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">say and this is different than a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:15.510" style="s2">capability crisis because it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.430" style="s2">if we&#39;re able to do anything it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.430" end="00:10:22.380" style="s2">the level of like cognitive sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.980" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">this a sense making crisis we just also</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.380" end="00:10:27.030" style="s2">talked about like like people like</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">Jordan Hall is a friend of mine so those</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.030" end="00:10:33.390" style="s2">are the four you&#39;ve got the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">crisis the legitimacy crisis the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.390" end="00:10:39.180" style="s2">crisis and the capability crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:42.780" style="s2">that&#39;s all on the what&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">called the interior T&#39;s of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.780" end="00:10:45.750" style="s2">which is to say these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">infrastructure failures they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.750" end="00:10:48.780" style="s2">condition for the possibility of</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.750" end="00:10:56.310" style="s2">political breakdowns there prior to them</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.670" end="00:10:59.030" style="s2">because they reside within the human</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.310" end="00:11:01.940" style="s2">psyche and body</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.030" end="00:11:04.430" style="s2">and so they&#39;re there the within and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.940" end="00:11:07.190" style="s2">there what they need to be grappled with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.430" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">in the dimension of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.190" end="00:11:15.380" style="s2">learning human development education</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">they&#39;re not technical problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.380" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">that is why I believe although education</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:21.590" style="s2">like you know I went to the Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:24.410" style="s2">Graduate School of Education which</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.590" end="00:11:26.090" style="s2">believe me is the low end of the totem</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.090" end="00:11:30.260" style="s2">schools of education at Harvard right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:35.140" style="s2">the amount of importance that&#39;s placed</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.260" end="00:11:37.490" style="s2">on education the marginalization of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.140" end="00:11:39.770" style="s2">visa fees of the Law School in the</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.570" end="00:11:51.410" style="s2">are going into hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.370" end="00:11:54.890" style="s2">dollars of student loan debt so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:11:56.390" style="s2">this question of why given the primacy</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.890" end="00:11:59.030" style="s2">condition for the possibility of</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.030" end="00:12:04.850" style="s2">the interior systems why education is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.280" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">important has it been so neglected and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.850" end="00:12:11.060" style="s2">actually at this point it is being</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">preyed upon by forces seeking to profit</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.060" end="00:12:17.330" style="s2">from the obvious crisis of capability</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:19.460" style="s2">the generosity of meaning predatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.330" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">student loan lending being the main one</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.460" end="00:12:24.410" style="s2">but also the overwhelming push to</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.410" end="00:12:29.300" style="s2">profit centers in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.420" end="00:12:31.250" style="s2">hospitals were made profit centers so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.300" end="00:12:33.050" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a little bit more there</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.250" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">about just when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.050" end="00:12:38.090" style="s2">meta-crisis the sharp end of the stick</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">is actually within our own minds and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.090" end="00:12:45.380" style="s2">educational system has been so poorly</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:48.380" style="s2">managed since about 1972 that were</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.500" end="00:13:40.450" style="s2">in the 70s and you know we talked in the</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.450" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">ethics of business fundamentally changed</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:47.590" style="s2">when there were limits on what people</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.190" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">conversation was about just that me</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.410" end="00:14:05.410" style="s2">fortunate to have worked for some</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.410" end="00:14:08.830" style="s2">would actually talk about what they</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.840" end="00:14:16.090" style="s2">wrong and Jordan said when he entered</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.010" end="00:14:28.300" style="s2">right or wrong and then we both agreed</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.960" end="00:14:31.570" style="s2">that by the time we were talking in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.300" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">it had gone another step to what should</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.750" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">know there&#39;s sort of a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:51.510" style="s2">change that was started to be visible at</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.310" end="00:15:27.080" style="s2">you describe as the reductive human</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.400" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">capital theory might be useful to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.080" end="00:15:30.920" style="s2">mind what you mean by the reductive</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:32.600" style="s2">human capital theory and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:35.720" style="s2">contrast that at the highest possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.600" end="00:15:38.930" style="s2">level with what you think we need yes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.720" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">human capital theories pretty well known</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.930" end="00:15:44.990" style="s2">way of thinking about the way human</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:47.510" style="s2">beings fit into economic reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.990" end="00:15:49.610" style="s2">decision-making and reductive human</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.510" end="00:15:53.030" style="s2">capital theory is basically the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.610" end="00:15:55.010" style="s2">kind of simplified and crude way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.030" end="00:15:57.710" style="s2">thinking about this and so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.010" end="00:16:00.770" style="s2">idea would be that human beings are like</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.710" end="00:16:04.520" style="s2">any other kind of capital or commodity</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.770" end="00:16:06.170" style="s2">and just like getting a bunch of money</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.520" end="00:16:09.290" style="s2">allows you to do something you call a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.170" end="00:16:10.790" style="s2">capital if you get a bunch of skills it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.290" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">allows you to do things so you can think</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.790" end="00:16:15.530" style="s2">of skills residing within humans right</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:16.970" style="s2">the interiors I was talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.530" end="00:16:18.890" style="s2">can think of those as a form of capital</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.970" end="00:16:21.980" style="s2">and then you conceive the educational</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.890" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">system as basically a sub component of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.980" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">the broader economy with the sub</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">function of supplying that economy with</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:32.890" style="s2">human capital and so you reduce the like</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.220" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">multifaceted</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.890" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">dimensions of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">transmission to 1 which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:43.970" style="s2">reproduction of the economic system and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:47.540" style="s2">that&#39;s reductive human capital theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.970" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2">and basically it is to use &#39;shmock to</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.350" end="00:16:59.720" style="s2">system it actually undermines the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.620" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">aspects of culture which are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.720" end="00:17:03.910" style="s2">hidden curriculum within the economy</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.900" style="s2">that actually allows it to function and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:08.390" style="s2">this is something that&#39;s been pointed</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.900" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">out by Marxists for a while</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.390" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">which is that yeah you think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">schools in the Ivy League universities</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:16.940" style="s2">that prepare your workers and CEOs but</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">it&#39;s actually their mothers who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.940" end="00:17:24.440" style="s2">paid at all so the hidden labor of human</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.490" end="00:17:37.040" style="s2">actually preyed upon so it&#39;s not Jim</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:40.130" style="s2">that the cultural transmission takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.040" end="00:17:42.740" style="s2">place around the tables of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.130" end="00:17:45.140" style="s2">and in the schools that&#39;s the case but</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.740" end="00:17:46.700" style="s2">why are the schools and dinner tables</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:50.110" style="s2">failing it&#39;s because of all the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.700" end="00:17:55.130" style="s2">predatory systems that are increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.110" end="00:17:57.080" style="s2">incursion increasingly colonizing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.130" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">life world so that when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.080" end="00:18:00.740" style="s2">at the human capital theory and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:02.780" style="s2">thinking well where the human capital</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.740" end="00:18:05.060" style="s2">actually supplied from where do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:07.730" style="s2">actually mine it we mined it in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.060" end="00:18:09.410" style="s2">families first and then we mined it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.730" end="00:18:13.060" style="s2">the schools and so you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.410" end="00:18:15.410" style="s2">preying upon this necessary dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.060" end="00:18:18.440" style="s2">intergenerational transmission and kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.410" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">of extracting from it this simplified</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.850" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">ends up in the long run undercutting the</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">schooling so that you get people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.180" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">yeah they have skills but they have no</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:38.690" style="s2">source of motivation they have no source</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:40.850" style="s2">of creative thinking they have no</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.010" end="00:19:06.800" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be commodified so that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.130" end="00:19:15.290" style="s2">education like when you think about No</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.290" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">the top and those kinds of models of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.810" end="00:19:23.720" style="s2">educational reform they&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:26.870" style="s2">dominated by human capital mentality you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.720" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">save the schools to save the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:31.480" style="s2">then similar to the global educational</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.690" end="00:19:42.500" style="s2">and other places similarly you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.730" end="00:19:44.840" style="s2">mostly the nature of the reforms</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.500" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">themselves held within this human</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:49.910" style="s2">capital mindset which again reduces</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:52.690" style="s2">education to lowest common denominator</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.910" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">need to reproduce the economics</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.690" end="00:19:59.080" style="s2">them and and pushing into the margins</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:01.480" style="s2">and actually kind of like offloading</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.080" end="00:20:03.010" style="s2">externalities into the other dimensions</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">that&#39;s my that&#39;s my thinking there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.560" end="00:20:17.260" style="s2">it is important not to actually blame</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">the schools or the mothers right when in</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.260" end="00:20:23.710" style="s2">fact it is many of the institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:25.150" style="s2">systems around the household in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.710" end="00:20:27.400" style="s2">school which make it almost impossible</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.150" end="00:20:29.650" style="s2">to do the right thing within them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.400" end="00:20:31.690" style="s2">this is a point I make in my book in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.650" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2">several places especially the chapter on</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.690" end="00:20:36.610" style="s2">social miracles which is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.750" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">the schools they need to be reformed</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.610" end="00:20:40.150" style="s2">it&#39;s the civilization that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.970" style="s2">reformed in order for us to have schools</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.150" end="00:20:45.730" style="s2">that we actually want you know most of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.970" end="00:20:48.070" style="s2">the most well-meaning educational reform</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.730" end="00:20:49.660" style="s2">projects fail not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.070" end="00:20:51.610" style="s2">impossible to do what they want to do in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.660" end="00:20:53.230" style="s2">the schools but rather because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.610" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">impossible to have a school like that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.230" end="00:20:57.400" style="s2">a culture like ours and a society like</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.780" style="s2">ours it&#39;s the classic look like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.400" end="00:21:00.970" style="s2">that would be great thing to do for kids</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.780" end="00:21:01.930" style="s2">that sounds wonderful but how could they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.970" end="00:21:03.550" style="s2">ever get a job</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.930" end="00:21:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like saying oh if you and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.550" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">one of Hampshire colleges problems if</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.680" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">you teach people to value meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.380" end="00:21:14.350" style="s2">work and to hate bullshit and to not</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:15.910" style="s2">vert you signal right and to not kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.350" end="00:21:18.310" style="s2">go to the lowest common denominator</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.910" end="00:21:20.350" style="s2">profit motive types of incentives and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.310" end="00:21:24.250" style="s2">then you release them into the world to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.350" end="00:21:26.890" style="s2">get jobs where are they gonna go right</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:29.140" style="s2">and so until we change the systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.890" end="00:21:31.510" style="s2">around the educational system we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.140" end="00:21:32.770" style="s2">pretend that making changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.510" end="00:21:35.560" style="s2">educational systems are really going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.770" end="00:21:37.450" style="s2">do anything that&#39;s a key point that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.560" end="00:21:39.490" style="s2">think is something that the audience</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.450" end="00:21:41.470" style="s2">should internalize before we go further</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.490" end="00:21:44.290" style="s2">because otherwise you could say I that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.470" end="00:21:46.630" style="s2">zactly he&#39;s a you know utopian screwball</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.290" end="00:21:48.130" style="s2">that shit won&#39;t work but if you take it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.630" end="00:21:51.190" style="s2">in the consideration that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.130" end="00:21:53.830" style="s2">about it as a kind of a two-part motion</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:55.630" style="s2">of Education with cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.830" end="00:21:57.670" style="s2">institutional reforms that the two</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.630" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">eventually converge into a world where</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.670" end="00:22:00.760" style="s2">they both make sense then we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.320" end="00:22:03.040" style="s2">something I had a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.760" end="00:22:04.660" style="s2">experience on Facebook yesterday where I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.040" end="00:22:06.490" style="s2">think I was actually Daniel Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.660" end="00:22:08.559" style="s2">and Berger posted a question on</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.490" end="00:22:10.900" style="s2">what would policing of the future look</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.559" end="00:22:12.850" style="s2">like and I put up my idea and someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.900" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">said that couldn&#39;t possibly work rabbits</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.850" end="00:22:17.559" style="s2">were craziest thing I received certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:19.780" style="s2">in a world like ours right but my</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.559" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">response will be exactly you know my</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.780" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">ideas about policing and I come from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">police family my dad was a career police</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:27.820" style="s2">officer my brother was - one of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:30.010" style="s2">favorite cousins so I know a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.820" end="00:22:32.620" style="s2">about you know the sociology of police</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.010" end="00:22:34.360" style="s2">from the ground floor my ideas of how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.620" end="00:22:36.280" style="s2">do a great policing yeah they would not</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.360" end="00:22:37.780" style="s2">work in our current society but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.280" end="00:22:40.330" style="s2">the point there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.780" end="00:22:42.790" style="s2">our current society because a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.330" end="00:22:45.820" style="s2">ethical form of policing can&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.790" end="00:22:49.240" style="s2">the same sense that a good ethical form</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.820" end="00:22:51.040" style="s2">of Education could not work in what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.240" end="00:22:54.600" style="s2">would call in game be talk you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.150" end="00:26:22.830" style="s2">precisely what you described in your you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.520" end="00:26:26.130" style="s2">know fascinating reflections on on your</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.830" end="00:26:29.550" style="s2">mother and the transition into a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.130" end="00:26:31.320" style="s2">generation who became status seeking and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.550" end="00:26:33.660" style="s2">then the transition again with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.320" end="00:26:35.640" style="s2">Millennials into a generation who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.660" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">not status seeking through consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.640" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">but that is in part because they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">poor and that is in part because they</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:44.760" style="s2">did not actually have the opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">for upward mobility that were provided</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.760" end="00:26:49.650" style="s2">for the baby boomer generation and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.180" style="s2">they&#39;ve been saddled with student loan</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:54.330" style="s2">debt student loan debt which the boomers</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.180" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t have they&#39;ve been facing a job</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.330" end="00:26:58.860" style="s2">market which is saturated by baby</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.840" style="s2">boomers at the highest levels who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.860" end="00:27:03.660" style="s2">holding under jobs 20 years longer than</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.840" end="00:27:06.650" style="s2">their parents did which is to say like</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.660" end="00:27:09.810" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t actually been a turnover</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.650" end="00:27:13.010" style="s2">generationally since the boomers took</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.810" end="00:27:17.160" style="s2">over and they are prolonging that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.010" end="00:27:19.650" style="s2">seemingly indefinitely and there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.160" end="00:27:23.670" style="s2">been a turnover of resources or access</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.650" end="00:27:27.680" style="s2">to power or wisdom / knowledge /</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.670" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">capacity and so that&#39;s just a striking</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.680" end="00:27:34.020" style="s2">situation which is kind of having these</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:38.570" style="s2">ramifications up and into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.020" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">meta-crisis so it is happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.570" end="00:27:46.560" style="s2">you know the result is actually when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:48.330" style="s2">starts to set in which is to say when</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.560" end="00:27:51.540" style="s2">intergenerational transmission truly</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.330" end="00:27:54.510" style="s2">fails you get a distance between the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.540" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">elders and the youth that is so great</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.510" end="00:27:58.860" style="s2">the only result can be strategic</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">relation which means generational</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.860" end="00:28:03.650" style="s2">warfare and there were some mark</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.530" style="s2">who believe that at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.650" end="00:28:08.630" style="s2">class warfare would transform into</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.530" end="00:28:10.760" style="s2">generational warfare there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.630" end="00:28:12.020" style="s2">reasons to see that as actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.760" end="00:28:14.180" style="s2">the things that&#39;s playing out here when</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.020" end="00:28:17.060" style="s2">you look at the nature of asset holding</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.180" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">and access to the halls of power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.060" end="00:28:24.530" style="s2">being hoarded by the boomers so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.930" style="s2">we&#39;re actually in the situation where we</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.530" end="00:28:28.610" style="s2">are approximating generational warfare</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.930" end="00:28:30.170" style="s2">and right now the Boomers are winning</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.610" end="00:28:31.940" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.170" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">yeah the boomers have had the presidency</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.940" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">since 1992 right interestingly Joe Biden</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:40.940" style="s2">is actually a silent he is not a boomer</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:43.880" style="s2">he came he&#39;s the very tail end of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.940" end="00:28:45.680" style="s2">generation before the Boomers but</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.880" end="00:28:47.810" style="s2">there&#39;s even a more extreme example of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.680" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">the dynamic I&#39;m talking about yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.810" end="00:28:52.130" style="s2">the fuck right here you know in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:54.680" style="s2">you know being part of the sixties I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.130" end="00:28:56.990" style="s2">part of a really violent upheaval which</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.680" end="00:28:59.150" style="s2">I heard fair amount more secondhand than</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.990" end="00:29:01.610" style="s2">primaries my time I got to college in 71</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.150" end="00:29:04.870" style="s2">the previous four years had been when</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.610" end="00:29:06.890" style="s2">the radical changes had come you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.870" end="00:29:08.660" style="s2">1967 at MIT</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.890" end="00:29:10.730" style="s2">you know the dorms were strictly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.660" end="00:29:13.190" style="s2">monitored no girls allowed in the room</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.730" end="00:29:16.550" style="s2">you know no drinking on campus blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.190" end="00:29:19.100" style="s2">blah by 1971 the boomers had routed the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.550" end="00:29:21.380" style="s2">silence and the GI Joes and had totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.100" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">intimidated them and we basically ran</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.380" end="00:29:24.770" style="s2">the goddamn place for both better in for</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:26.690" style="s2">worse I mean I think it had some</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.770" end="00:29:29.150" style="s2">negative consequences but we had</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.690" end="00:29:32.150" style="s2">terrorized the older generation into</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.150" end="00:29:34.550" style="s2">submission to our demands and by 1971</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.150" end="00:29:36.050" style="s2">our dorm was wide open you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.550" end="00:29:37.970" style="s2">your girlfriend over for the weekend no</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.050" end="00:29:39.560" style="s2">problem you could we had to deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.970" end="00:29:41.810" style="s2">local liquor store that would deliver</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.560" end="00:29:45.170" style="s2">liquor to the front desk totally illegal</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.810" end="00:29:47.890" style="s2">oh well and the boomers routed the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.170" end="00:29:51.500" style="s2">previous generations in an astoundingly</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.890" end="00:29:54.830" style="s2">binary way between about 1967 and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.500" end="00:29:57.320" style="s2">at the latest 1975 nothing like that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.830" end="00:29:59.270" style="s2">happened at all right and we had our</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.320" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">first boomer president with Bill Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.270" end="00:30:04.160" style="s2">when he was quite young so maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">Boomers learned from their victory how</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.160" end="00:30:10.980" style="s2">not to be displaced we shall see yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:14.560" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.980" end="00:30:17.740" style="s2">striking and disturbing when you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.560" end="00:30:21.010" style="s2">about the the position of the youth of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.740" end="00:30:24.040" style="s2">ISA V the elders if it is a purely</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.010" end="00:30:26.200" style="s2">strategic relationship and you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.040" end="00:30:27.670" style="s2">that your first conversation with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.200" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">Hall you are like yeah when I got into</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.670" end="00:30:31.900" style="s2">the business world it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:33.130" style="s2">ethical but then the thing that remains</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.900" end="00:30:34.870" style="s2">unsaid is that and then when my</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.130" end="00:30:38.230" style="s2">generation took over the business world</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.870" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">it became completely unethical yep right</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.230" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">that which is the generation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:45.610" style="s2">actually caused you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.680" style="s2">striking thing and and so yeah so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.610" end="00:30:49.540" style="s2">I think we&#39;re in that situation when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.680" end="00:30:51.250" style="s2">look at the educational reform dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.540" end="00:30:53.380" style="s2">and the Predators to Delon ding and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.250" end="00:30:55.030" style="s2">nature student loan market the predatory</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.380" end="00:31:00.700" style="s2">student loan market and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.030" end="00:31:04.140" style="s2">the the d professionalization of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.700" end="00:31:08.440" style="s2">of the work that&#39;s taking place now and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.140" end="00:31:11.290" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.440" end="00:31:16.030" style="s2">youth are gonna do in the next decade</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.290" end="00:31:21.490" style="s2">and so i worry a lot actually about ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.030" end="00:31:25.590" style="s2">to help to mitigate the most extreme</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.490" end="00:31:27.820" style="s2">aspects of this educational crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.590" end="00:31:29.950" style="s2">right now with the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.820" end="00:31:34.180" style="s2">situation with the pandemic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.950" end="00:31:35.860" style="s2">actually not in school the schools have</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.180" end="00:31:37.690" style="s2">been shut down and most of the reports</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.860" end="00:31:40.210" style="s2">I&#39;m getting from teachers are that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.690" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">not working great it&#39;s intently in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.210" end="00:31:44.440" style="s2">book I suggest that all the schools</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:47.590" style="s2">should have already put in place</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.440" end="00:31:49.390" style="s2">something like a alternative educational</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.590" end="00:31:51.280" style="s2">hub network right that when the buses</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.390" end="00:31:53.920" style="s2">can&#39;t run and the lunches can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.280" end="00:31:55.180" style="s2">served in the cafeteria is there</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.920" end="00:31:57.160" style="s2">something like a generator for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.180" end="00:31:58.780" style="s2">educational system that you can shut the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.160" end="00:32:01.000" style="s2">physical infrastructure and boot the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">digital infrastructure and then have</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.000" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">this backup system of a distributed kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:08.770" style="s2">of educational hub network and none of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">those were actually put in place even</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.770" end="00:32:11.650" style="s2">though I had some conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:14.920" style="s2">school districts suggesting they do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.650" end="00:32:16.790" style="s2">you know like in Vermont there&#39;s you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.920" end="00:32:19.100" style="s2">get a snow week in Vermont</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.790" end="00:32:21.320" style="s2">you know because it dumps whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.100" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">feed or something and it&#39;s like for</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.320" end="00:32:24.830" style="s2">those weeks the kids just simply aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.000" end="00:32:27.770" style="s2">in school and so the whole country was</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.830" end="00:32:30.250" style="s2">basically asked to rapidly transition</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.770" end="00:32:33.320" style="s2">into it completely distributed digitally</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.250" end="00:32:35.780" style="s2">facilitated kind of stay-at-home school</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.320" end="00:32:38.780" style="s2">system and it&#39;s mostly been an abject</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.780" end="00:32:40.940" style="s2">failure although of course there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.780" end="00:32:43.100" style="s2">pockets of innovation and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.940" end="00:32:44.270" style="s2">means is like you know these kids are</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.100" end="00:32:45.800" style="s2">going to advance to the next grade</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.270" end="00:32:48.140" style="s2">without actually having finished the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.800" end="00:32:50.030" style="s2">previous grade or not I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.140" end="00:32:51.980" style="s2">some talk that the right thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.030" end="00:32:53.900" style="s2">just have everybody do this last grade</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.980" end="00:32:56.210" style="s2">over again which will have all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.900" end="00:32:58.400" style="s2">weird backups in the downstream system</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.210" end="00:33:01.010" style="s2">including a whole lack of a freshman</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.670" end="00:35:01.249" style="s2">fact one of things I did like about your</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.049" end="00:35:02.930" style="s2">book at first I was hey no goddamnit</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.249" end="00:35:05.269" style="s2">this is a guy with a hammer and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.930" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">everything is that education nail but</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.269" end="00:35:08.539" style="s2">you could come out and say quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:10.390" style="s2">strongly that throughout the book you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.539" end="00:35:13.160" style="s2">looking at the interdependence between</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.390" end="00:35:15.619" style="s2">educational organizations teach early</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.160" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">practice and the rest of society and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.619" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">culture and this idea of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">systems that are coupled in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:24.410" style="s2">and have extraordinarily complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:25.400" style="s2">nonlinear dynamics I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.410" end="00:35:26.869" style="s2">something you could have done a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.400" end="00:35:29.869" style="s2">bit more of in the book but you clearly</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.869" end="00:35:32.089" style="s2">are informed by that perspective yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.869" end="00:35:33.289" style="s2">absolutely and it&#39;s a so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.089" end="00:35:35.479" style="s2">talking about the schools and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.289" end="00:35:36.319" style="s2">where most people locate education and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.479" end="00:35:38.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve been using the term</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.319" end="00:35:40.339" style="s2">intergenerational transmission to try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.140" end="00:35:43.369" style="s2">kind of signal that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.339" end="00:35:45.140" style="s2">much deeper way to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.369" end="00:35:48.589" style="s2">function of education which makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.140" end="00:35:52.369" style="s2">schools actually a kind of relatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.589" end="00:35:53.749" style="s2">new historical invention and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.369" end="00:35:57.219" style="s2">whole other conversation but yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.749" end="00:36:00.499" style="s2">coming from a complex systems view of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.219" end="00:36:02.269" style="s2">societal evolution and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.499" end="00:36:04.910" style="s2">mentioned Wallerstein and he pulls on</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.269" end="00:36:07.009" style="s2">Prigogine and background with the Santa</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.910" end="00:36:10.309" style="s2">Fe Institute type you know Jeffrey west</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.009" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">and Ervin Laszlo and other people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.309" end="00:36:16.459" style="s2">modeled social systems as basically Otto</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:19.609" style="s2">poetically reproducing themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.459" end="00:36:21.670" style="s2">terms of complex systems dynamics and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.609" end="00:36:24.799" style="s2">as an intergenerational transmission is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.670" end="00:36:26.329" style="s2">basically the autopoietic function of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.799" end="00:36:28.069" style="s2">the social system which means that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.329" end="00:36:30.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just happen in schools at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.069" end="00:36:32.359" style="s2">and that in fact if I make a grocery</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.949" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">store the way grocery stores have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.359" end="00:36:37.009" style="s2">made there&#39;s a hidden curriculum there</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:40.039" style="s2">I&#39;m transmitting to the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.009" end="00:36:41.509" style="s2">something about what food is even though</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.039" end="00:36:43.390" style="s2">I never mentioned in schools on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.509" end="00:36:46.809" style="s2">curriculum same thing with energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.390" end="00:36:50.220" style="s2">same thing with water transportation etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.809" end="00:36:52.150" style="s2">so there&#39;s a deeper pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.220" end="00:36:54.789" style="s2">intergenerational transmission which</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.150" end="00:36:57.670" style="s2">john dewey noted early that all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.789" end="00:37:01.269" style="s2">institutions and patterns of a society</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.670" end="00:37:02.769" style="s2">are educated or educational as if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.269" end="00:37:05.170" style="s2">actually the definition of education I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.769" end="00:37:07.000" style="s2">working with not just schools in fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.170" end="00:37:08.650" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting schools as we&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.000" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2">them are basically obsolete you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.650" end="00:37:13.329" style="s2">modern inventions which were useful in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:16.710" style="s2">certain period of time but that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.329" end="00:37:19.079" style="s2">basically decades past their prime of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.710" end="00:37:22.599" style="s2">efficiency for serving the autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.079" end="00:37:25.210" style="s2">regeneration of the social system so</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.599" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">it&#39;s important to see that yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.210" end="00:37:29.349" style="s2">can see vegetation that broadly then</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">you&#39;re actually looking at a range of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.349" end="00:37:33.549" style="s2">problems which are outside the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:36.180" style="s2">just educational reform as we&#39;ve usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.549" end="00:37:38.260" style="s2">discussed it which means school reform</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.180" end="00:37:41.559" style="s2">the most obvious one is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.260" end="00:37:43.779" style="s2">informational ecology you know which has</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.559" end="00:37:47.710" style="s2">in the last couple decades just become</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.779" end="00:37:51.519" style="s2">probably the the main effect when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.710" end="00:37:54.369" style="s2">looking at people&#39;s capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.519" end="00:37:57.160" style="s2">epistemic s&#39; you know their frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.369" end="00:37:59.079" style="s2">and their internal working models of who</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.160" end="00:38:00.819" style="s2">they are and what the world is about and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.079" end="00:38:02.920" style="s2">when you look at adolescent culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.819" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">right now in conjunction with everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.920" end="00:38:05.859" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about how the schools are</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">failed and in part because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.859" end="00:38:11.380" style="s2">obsolete in part because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:13.660" style="s2">handle this exact problem which is how</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.380" end="00:38:16.089" style="s2">do you stop the kids from getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.660" end="00:38:17.650" style="s2">brainwashed by social media when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.089" end="00:38:21.400" style="s2">freaking adults are brainwashed by</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.430" end="00:39:40.829" style="s2">I would say ninety percent at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.859" end="00:39:43.349" style="s2">maybe more now of my time on Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.829" end="00:39:45.420" style="s2">in specialized groups of people who have</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.420" end="00:39:51.930" style="s2">fashion to pursue a specific agenda and</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.510" end="00:40:00.869" style="s2">hottest part of the game be movement is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:03.930" style="s2">on the game be group on Facebook about</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.970" end="00:40:10.200" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s ads in</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.800" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">conversations on Facebook and now we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:19.710" style="s2">have decided that the core group had</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:22.050" style="s2">gotten about two months ago two heavily</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.710" end="00:40:23.310" style="s2">trafficked it was too many topics and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.050" end="00:40:25.589" style="s2">we took one of the affordances of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.310" end="00:40:27.329" style="s2">Facebook which they don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.589" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">probably could be used for this we</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.329" end="00:40:32.339" style="s2">created a game B page the game B page on</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">Facebook which then links to so far</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.339" end="00:40:37.640" style="s2">about eighteen additional groups of game</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:39.930" style="s2">be game be branded so we have game be</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.640" end="00:40:42.540" style="s2">community building game be parenting</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.930" end="00:40:46.349" style="s2">game be education game be communities</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.540" end="00:40:48.510" style="s2">etc and so we have taken the tools</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.349" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">available that Facebook created for god</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.510" end="00:40:53.640" style="s2">knows what reason and have molded them</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.640" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">number one</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.380" end="00:41:01.890" style="s2">Twitter is even worse in many ways</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.890" end="00:41:06.080" style="s2">time on curation but these tools can be</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.100" end="00:42:09.770" style="s2">way earlier if I&#39;d had access to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.440" end="00:42:12.140" style="s2">tool so it&#39;s not all bad in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.770" end="00:42:13.430" style="s2">lots really good and one that you slam a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.140" end="00:42:15.590" style="s2">little but I&#39;d love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.430" end="00:42:17.480" style="s2">thoughts on that was Khan Academy again</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.590" end="00:42:19.460" style="s2">when I first stumbled across the Khan</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.480" end="00:42:22.490" style="s2">Academy ago god damn it I wish I&#39;d had</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.460" end="00:42:24.110" style="s2">access to that when I was 10 or 11 that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.490" end="00:42:27.230" style="s2">would have been amazing I had to listen</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.110" end="00:42:29.210" style="s2">to these droning boring people who you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.230" end="00:42:31.460" style="s2">know spent three-quarters of each years</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.210" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">math class recapitulating last year&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.460" end="00:42:35.090" style="s2">why can&#39;t we move on son of a bitch is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.730" style="s2">with the Khan Academy I could have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.090" end="00:42:40.040" style="s2">teaching myself calculus when I was 13</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.730" end="00:42:43.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of good in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.040" end="00:42:45.890" style="s2">information systems of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:48.130" style="s2">and the overall recommendation of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.890" end="00:42:50.090" style="s2">book is actually to transition out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.130" end="00:42:54.530" style="s2">traditional brick-and-mortar schools</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.090" end="00:42:57.110" style="s2">into a educational system that has you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.530" end="00:42:58.700" style="s2">know in massively new potentialities as</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.110" end="00:43:00.620" style="s2">a result of embracing digital</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.700" end="00:43:04.340" style="s2">technologies but there&#39;s this question</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.620" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">of you know what is actually educational</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.340" end="00:43:09.950" style="s2">as opposed to just informational and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:13.550" style="s2">informational environments are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.950" end="00:43:16.610" style="s2">necessarily educational environments and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.550" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">so there&#39;s a complex thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.610" end="00:43:20.830" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:22.900" style="s2">we think that using digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.830" end="00:43:25.210" style="s2">for education means getting kids to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.900" end="00:43:26.650" style="s2">stare at screens all day and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.210" end="00:43:28.900" style="s2">absolutely doesn&#39;t need to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.650" end="00:43:30.220" style="s2">and I have some design kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.900" end="00:43:33.640" style="s2">recommendations in my book for</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.220" end="00:43:37.870" style="s2">educational technologies that would not</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.640" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">actually depend upon increased screen</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.870" end="00:43:43.330" style="s2">usage and isolated you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">autistic exploration through uncured</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.330" end="00:43:47.710" style="s2">informational environments so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:49.840" style="s2">factor which is that you know Khan</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.710" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">Academy is amazing actually think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.840" end="00:43:56.260" style="s2">an incredible resource but it is kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:58.210" style="s2">starin at screens all day and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.260" end="00:44:00.820" style="s2">what education is at a fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.210" end="00:44:02.770" style="s2">so the idea that you could roll out a</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.820" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">national digital curriculum which would</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.770" end="00:44:05.770" style="s2">have kids sitting in front of computer</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:07.510" style="s2">screens for seven hours a day and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.770" end="00:44:08.380" style="s2">education and it&#39;s actually better than</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.510" end="00:44:12.070" style="s2">it used to be because they have access</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.380" end="00:44:14.500" style="s2">to everything super naive right most of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.070" end="00:44:17.020" style="s2">Education happens in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.500" end="00:44:19.930" style="s2">actual other people in real space and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.020" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">time and sensory motor development</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.930" end="00:44:22.990" style="s2">aesthetic development ethical</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.510" style="s2">development all of these things outside</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.990" end="00:44:27.340" style="s2">of the merely cognitive and science</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.510" end="00:44:29.050" style="s2">technology engineering and math domains</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.340" end="00:44:34.110" style="s2">all of those things require real human</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.050" end="00:44:36.580" style="s2">interpersonal contact so that&#39;s one -</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.110" end="00:44:38.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a rawls in so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.580" end="00:44:41.560" style="s2">think in a very principled way about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.500" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">nature of justice and justice is about</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.560" end="00:44:47.800" style="s2">the way basic institutions of society</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:51.490" style="s2">kind of like set the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.800" end="00:44:55.060" style="s2">people to to work and thrive in and when</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.490" end="00:44:57.850" style="s2">you&#39;re judging a system the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.060" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">judge is actually by taking into account</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.850" end="00:45:04.300" style="s2">first and foremost the position of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:05.950" style="s2">least well-off and so of course 13-year</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.300" end="00:45:09.340" style="s2">old Jim Rotten would have done great</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.950" end="00:45:12.100" style="s2">with Google and Google Scholar and my</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.340" end="00:45:14.530" style="s2">sense is in fact you know even if that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.100" end="00:45:15.940" style="s2">Jim rut had access to Facebook he may</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.530" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">have been disciplined enough to not go</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.940" end="00:45:20.710" style="s2">on Facebook or to use Facebook in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">really sophisticated way but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.710" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">when you&#39;re look at what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:28.599" style="s2">those kids who are not self directed</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:32.920" style="s2">learners right who have trauma or who</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.599" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">are in other ways not talented enough to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.920" end="00:45:38.290" style="s2">turn an informational ecosystem into it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:39.400" style="s2">an educational ecosystem you get in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.290" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">situation where you look at what</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.400" end="00:45:43.210" style="s2">Facebook does to those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">just captured by it all right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.210" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">like totally there&#39;s a park beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.630" style="s2">park right people sell crack in the park</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.130" style="s2">right but there are places in the park</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.630" end="00:45:52.270" style="s2">where you can play basketball so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.130" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">saying basically like hey we can play</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.270" end="00:45:55.869" style="s2">basketball in this park and I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:59.290" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s crack dealers in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.869" end="00:46:00.849" style="s2">park I love that that I love that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.290" end="00:46:03.160" style="s2">gonna steal at it well I&#39;ll give credit</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.849" end="00:46:04.540" style="s2">but that&#39;s a perfect example of Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.160" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a nice park</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.540" end="00:46:07.540" style="s2">there&#39;s picnic tables you can take your</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.190" end="00:46:09.310" style="s2">family because you know a lot people use</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.540" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">Facebook mostly to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.310" end="00:46:13.750" style="s2">their family tically boomers right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:15.460" style="s2">so it&#39;s good but oh yeah there&#39;s crack</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.750" end="00:46:17.470" style="s2">dealers and there&#39;s hypnotists they go</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.460" end="00:46:18.670" style="s2">turn you into a sex criminal all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.470" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">of weird shit out there</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.670" end="00:46:23.560" style="s2">no and it&#39;s and what I&#39;m saying is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:26.619" style="s2">I what most people know my Facebook&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.560" end="00:46:29.230" style="s2">actually open question right like show</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.619" end="00:46:31.180" style="s2">us the data Facebook what are people</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.230" end="00:46:33.700" style="s2">doing like the advertisers know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.180" end="00:46:35.470" style="s2">most people do on Facebook but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.700" end="00:46:37.089" style="s2">clear to me what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.470" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">there we know it drives depression we</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.089" end="00:46:41.950" style="s2">know it drives addiction we know it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">drives conspiracy theories we know it</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.950" end="00:46:45.130" style="s2">drives lowering self-esteem and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:46.330" style="s2">adolescence and cyberbullying and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.130" end="00:46:47.770" style="s2">whole bunch of other stuff so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.330" end="00:46:49.869" style="s2">saying like oh it&#39;s a nice Park and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.770" end="00:46:52.510" style="s2">drug dealers are hiding there I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.869" end="00:46:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a park where drugs are dealt there</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.510" end="00:46:58.060" style="s2">are places in it where it&#39;s maybe safe</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.950" end="00:46:59.410" style="s2">but in order to get to those places you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.060" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">have to walk through the places where</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.410" end="00:47:04.839" style="s2">it&#39;s filled with drug dealers and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:06.609" style="s2">by design like Facebook brought in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.839" end="00:47:08.080" style="s2">people with an expertise in addiction to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.609" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">help them think about design features</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.080" end="00:47:12.820" style="s2">not that make them not addictive you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:15.550" style="s2">know the same way that fast-food</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.820" end="00:47:17.260" style="s2">companies put chemicals to basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.550" end="00:47:21.010" style="s2">make flavors that are radically</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.260" end="00:47:23.070" style="s2">addictive and so this is by design that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.010" end="00:47:25.060" style="s2">it&#39;s capturing attention completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.070" end="00:47:27.700" style="s2">distracting and destroying the epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.060" end="00:47:28.760" style="s2">of the youth and some of the adults many</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.700" end="00:47:30.380" style="s2">of the adults</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.760" end="00:47:31.970" style="s2">oh yeah we&#39;ve talked about this on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.380" end="00:47:33.830" style="s2">show quite a bit in fact just recently I</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.970" end="00:47:36.500" style="s2">did an episode with Steven Levy who</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.830" end="00:47:38.810" style="s2">wrote a book about Facebook and he gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.500" end="00:47:41.300" style="s2">into a lot of this and my friend Tristan</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.810" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">Harris was on the show and I think his</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.300" end="00:47:45.370" style="s2">group Humane tech is doing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">very best work at theorizing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.370" end="00:47:50.210" style="s2">capturing to the degree they can as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:51.770" style="s2">point out the inner data is not</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.210" end="00:47:53.390" style="s2">available but there&#39;s a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.770" end="00:47:55.460" style="s2">scientific research that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.390" end="00:47:57.320" style="s2">published on facebook on how people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.460" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">using it and what it&#39;s actually doing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.320" end="00:48:00.710" style="s2">us and some of those dimensions you</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">talked about you know teenage depression</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.710" end="00:48:05.570" style="s2">teenage suicide may well be causally</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:07.880" style="s2">linked the really big turn up is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.570" end="00:48:09.470" style="s2">suspiciously well correlated with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:12.500" style="s2">introduction of the smartphone and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.470" end="00:48:15.080" style="s2">proliferation of Facebook as the default</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">meeting ground for teens in you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.080" end="00:48:20.120" style="s2">2010 timeframe how about a pivot here</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:24.080" style="s2">now a little bit - what I took away as</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.120" end="00:48:26.300" style="s2">maybe the central theme of your book</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.080" end="00:48:29.380" style="s2">which to use your words</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.300" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">the importance of rithi rising teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.380" end="00:48:35.270" style="s2">authority and responsibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:38.090" style="s2">contemporary educational configurations</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.270" end="00:48:40.340" style="s2">this struck me as being very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.090" end="00:48:43.910" style="s2">the discussion about Google Scholar or</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.340" end="00:48:45.230" style="s2">Google itself or Wikipedia as a resource</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.910" end="00:48:48.230" style="s2">but without having something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.230" end="00:48:52.120" style="s2">teacherly authority to help guide and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.230" end="00:48:55.190" style="s2">error correct and form the broader</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.120" end="00:48:57.620" style="s2">contexts and indeed something would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.190" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">quite lacking in the you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.620" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">self configuration that some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:04.360" style="s2">might even the 13-year old gym rut would</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:07.370" style="s2">have failed to do if they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.360" end="00:49:10.280" style="s2">excellent teacher Lee authority in some</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.370" end="00:49:12.080" style="s2">form so I&#39;d love to have you riff on</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.280" end="00:49:14.360" style="s2">that one let me know if you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.080" end="00:49:18.410" style="s2">close to your theme and second riff</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.360" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">pretty deeply on what a really good new</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.410" end="00:49:23.240" style="s2">modern form of distributed teacher lee</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:26.870" style="s2">authority might look like yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.240" end="00:49:29.930" style="s2">teacher Lee authority yeah it is at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.870" end="00:49:32.260" style="s2">at the root of the theorizing I do it in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.930" end="00:49:34.790" style="s2">the book it&#39;s actually the root of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.260" end="00:49:37.370" style="s2">resolving the educational crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.790" end="00:49:40.310" style="s2">therefore the meta crisis it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.370" end="00:49:42.230" style="s2">like the reestablishing of a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.310" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">teacher Lee a new kind of teacher Lee</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.230" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">authority and what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:53.000" style="s2">you know you actually don&#39;t get anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:55.790" style="s2">like human culture without teacher Lee</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.000" end="00:49:57.800" style="s2">Authority and I&#39;ve you know made some</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.790" end="00:49:59.810" style="s2">arguments based on the work of Michael</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.800" end="00:50:01.940" style="s2">Tomasello who was at the Max Planck</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.810" end="00:50:03.740" style="s2">Institute for a while as a comparative</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.940" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">psychologist looking at the differences</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.740" end="00:50:07.730" style="s2">between primates and humans in</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:10.220" style="s2">particular and although it doesn&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.730" end="00:50:12.080" style="s2">it in these terms this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.220" end="00:50:14.660" style="s2">definitely the conclusion of his work</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.080" end="00:50:18.740" style="s2">which is something like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:21.620" style="s2">species specific trait to the human to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.740" end="00:50:23.330" style="s2">homo sapiens sapiens and that species</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.620" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">specific trait which is the real</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.330" end="00:50:27.170" style="s2">differentiator because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.460" style="s2">that we share with monkeys and other</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.170" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">primates and then even things like</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.460" end="00:50:34.760" style="s2">whales and that is actually this teacher</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:36.950" style="s2">Lee Authority that it&#39;s a specific kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.760" end="00:50:40.220" style="s2">of intergenerational transmission which</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.950" end="00:50:44.330" style="s2">is facilitated by joint attentional</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.220" end="00:50:47.960" style="s2">awareness necessary you and me engaging</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.330" end="00:50:49.790" style="s2">with something in a context where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.960" end="00:50:52.940" style="s2">have greater knowledge and capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.790" end="00:50:57.560" style="s2">I have less and we both know I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.940" end="00:51:00.280" style="s2">to learn from you this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.560" end="00:51:02.870" style="s2">like species specific kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.280" end="00:51:05.660" style="s2">anthropologically deep-seated kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.870" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">like archetype of teaching and learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.660" end="00:51:12.260" style="s2">and you know people have argued with</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.460" end="00:51:14.300" style="s2">Michael Tomasello well no it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.260" end="00:51:16.130" style="s2">clear like monkeys teach other monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.300" end="00:51:18.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s their their</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.130" end="00:51:20.600" style="s2">you know the mother monkey we&#39;ll put the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.590" end="00:51:23.360" style="s2">stick in the anthill and bring out ants</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.600" end="00:51:26.300" style="s2">and then leave the stick there and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.360" end="00:51:28.790" style="s2">the kid will try it but there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.300" end="00:51:31.190" style="s2">like the complexity and abstraction of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.790" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">joint attention that you get even in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.190" end="00:51:35.990" style="s2">symbolist interaction with a toddler so</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:37.060" style="s2">just a simple example is that monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.990" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">don&#39;t point</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.060" end="00:51:42.220" style="s2">and you know he did a lot of research on</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:44.140" style="s2">this in the you know like 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.220" end="00:51:45.550" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure other people have followed</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.140" end="00:51:49.750" style="s2">up and there may be some complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.550" end="00:51:54.550" style="s2">you know if I point to add something</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.750" end="00:51:58.690" style="s2">most or look carefully most young humans</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.550" end="00:52:00.040" style="s2">will follow my point and dogs follow</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.690" end="00:52:02.110" style="s2">points because they&#39;ve been involved</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.040" end="00:52:03.610" style="s2">with us but in nature spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.110" end="00:52:05.110" style="s2">monkeys don&#39;t point for other monkeys to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.610" end="00:52:07.270" style="s2">follow and this is something about joint</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.110" end="00:52:10.120" style="s2">attention and it&#39;s something about again</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.270" end="00:52:11.950" style="s2">the the things that set humans apart and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.120" end="00:52:13.720" style="s2">allow for the kinds of civilizations</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.190" end="00:52:31.420" style="s2">teacherly Authority don&#39;t think like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.650" end="00:52:34.450" style="s2">teacher in a school don&#39;t think that at</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.010" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">that&#39;s this modern bias in fact teach</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.180" end="00:52:56.260" style="s2">in fact as soon as we start putting them</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.010" end="00:53:01.060" style="s2">in play is when you could say oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.260" end="00:53:03.070" style="s2">human and so they work as I described</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.700" end="00:54:04.980" style="s2">right so if I claim to have an asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.460" end="00:54:08.099" style="s2">of knowledge and power but in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.980" end="00:54:10.170" style="s2">only have any symmetry of power then I</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.099" end="00:54:13.530" style="s2">have pseudo teacherly Authority which</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.170" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">has been the big problem lately um where</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.530" end="00:54:18.990" style="s2">I have actual a symmetry of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:21.410" style="s2">then you can actually have something</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.990" end="00:54:24.890" style="s2">like legitimate teacherly Authority</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.410" end="00:54:28.020" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been in state-run</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.890" end="00:54:30.060" style="s2">institutionalized schools where teachers</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.020" end="00:54:32.910" style="s2">have teacherly authority by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.060" end="00:54:35.190" style="s2">power differential and maybe sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.910" end="00:54:38.430" style="s2">knowledge differential but definitely by</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.190" end="00:54:40.010" style="s2">virtue of power differential then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.430" end="00:54:44.280" style="s2">lay the groundwork for slowly</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.010" end="00:54:46.230" style="s2">undermining the ability to perceive a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.280" end="00:54:48.210" style="s2">legitimate teacherly authority so this</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.230" end="00:54:50.580" style="s2">is what&#39;s important when people talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.210" end="00:54:52.530" style="s2">about you know a working group coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.580" end="00:54:53.970" style="s2">together and it&#39;s a bunch of people with</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.530" end="00:54:56.130" style="s2">different capacities and then a</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.970" end="00:54:58.890" style="s2">spontaneous hierarchy emerges within the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.130" end="00:55:01.670" style="s2">group it&#39;s not a bureaucratic hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.890" end="00:55:04.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a hierarchy of competence and skill</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.670" end="00:55:06.599" style="s2">and we all want to be in those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.650" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">situations but that relies upon the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.599" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">ability of people to perceive actual</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">differences in capacity and fall into</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">line in terms of the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">teacherly Authority and so for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">right now I&#39;m kind of holding forth with</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:28.500" style="s2">teacherly Authority about teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:33.240" style="s2">Authority how matter how meta but when I</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.500" end="00:55:34.530" style="s2">when I go to the auto mechanic and he is</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.240" end="00:55:36.570" style="s2">telling me about this problem with my</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.530" end="00:55:39.089" style="s2">car and I&#39;m asking questions like well</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.570" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">how does that actually work and then the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.089" end="00:55:43.050" style="s2">auto mechanic is on the up gradient of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:45.900" style="s2">the capacity differential he is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.050" end="00:55:48.570" style="s2">exercising teacherly authority over me</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.900" end="00:55:49.890" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s not that it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.570" end="00:55:51.000" style="s2">person is always in a position of teach</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.890" end="00:55:53.670" style="s2">really Authority that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.000" end="00:55:55.279" style="s2">pathological it&#39;s actually these suit</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.670" end="00:55:59.169" style="s2">very flexible</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.279" end="00:56:04.339" style="s2">and dynamically shifting structures and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.169" end="00:56:06.859" style="s2">and it&#39;s the ability to basically create</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.339" end="00:56:08.599" style="s2">containers and this is what it was is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.859" end="00:56:11.509" style="s2">the notion of a school right and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.599" end="00:56:13.479" style="s2">notion of a place in society where</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.509" end="00:56:16.039" style="s2">education takes place in particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.479" end="00:56:17.719" style="s2">create these containers where legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.039" end="00:56:21.499" style="s2">teacher the authority can be most easily</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.719" end="00:56:24.949" style="s2">recognized and harnessed and where the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.499" end="00:56:27.109" style="s2">student and the teacher are able to fall</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.949" end="00:56:31.400" style="s2">into the dynamics of trust and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.109" end="00:56:32.839" style="s2">interaction that are required so and</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.400" end="00:56:35.299" style="s2">there&#39;s more to say so you can look also</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.839" end="00:56:37.969" style="s2">as a developmental psychologist which</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.299" end="00:56:40.699" style="s2">I&#39;ve that&#39;s like my formal training you</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.969" end="00:56:41.989" style="s2">can look at those capacity differentials</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.699" end="00:56:43.249" style="s2">that lay the groundwork for teach early</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.989" end="00:56:46.459" style="s2">Authority and can look at them very</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.249" end="00:56:48.890" style="s2">specifically you know and it&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.459" end="00:56:51.829" style="s2">clear and early childhood but even in</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.890" end="00:56:54.140" style="s2">adulthood with high order conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.829" end="00:56:56.929" style="s2">frameworks in and capacity acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.140" end="00:56:59.239" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to to mark the learning</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.929" end="00:57:01.880" style="s2">sequences that unfold in these different</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.239" end="00:57:03.849" style="s2">domains and see where just how much more</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.880" end="00:57:06.890" style="s2">knowledge does that person have right</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.849" end="00:57:08.659" style="s2">like how legitimate is that teacher the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.890" end="00:57:10.189" style="s2">authority is it just that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.659" end="00:57:12.140" style="s2">novel way of speaking and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.189" end="00:57:13.999" style="s2">charismatic or is it that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.140" end="00:57:16.369" style="s2">actually really a knowledge incapacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.999" end="00:57:17.989" style="s2">differential and so those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.369" end="00:57:19.519" style="s2">discernments which need to be made on</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.989" end="00:57:21.909" style="s2">the part of the student and the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.519" end="00:57:25.969" style="s2">if they&#39;re honest and self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.909" end="00:57:26.929" style="s2">those things need to be revealed and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.969" end="00:57:29.900" style="s2">thematized</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.929" end="00:57:32.689" style="s2">and felt so i mentioned the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.900" end="00:57:36.019" style="s2">teacher lee authority being based solely</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.689" end="00:57:38.359" style="s2">on bureaucratic power but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.019" end="00:57:40.699" style="s2">this problem which is more novel which</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.359" end="00:57:43.759" style="s2">is teacher lee authority being based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.699" end="00:57:50.019" style="s2">something like the popularity of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.759" end="00:57:52.909" style="s2">platform or the number of likes or views</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.019" end="00:57:54.829" style="s2">or celebrity status so I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.909" end="00:57:57.019" style="s2">the transformation of teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.829" end="00:57:59.880" style="s2">authority in the context of the digital</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.019" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">information Ecology&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.880" end="00:58:03.270" style="s2">this is kind of what in the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.460" style="s2">decades has actually brought what was</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.270" end="00:58:08.820" style="s2">already an educational crisis to a head</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.460" end="00:58:11.780" style="s2">which is that the water has become so</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.820" end="00:58:14.760" style="s2">muddy in terms of how to detect</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.780" end="00:58:16.650" style="s2">legitimate teach really Authority that</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.760" end="00:58:20.970" style="s2">now we don&#39;t even know it when we see it</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.650" end="00:58:26.280" style="s2">and when we do see it there&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.970" end="00:58:31.170" style="s2">knee-jerk reaction to destroy it that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.280" end="00:58:32.550" style="s2">teacher the authority is not wanted</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.170" end="00:58:35.640" style="s2">and so now we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.550" end="00:58:39.090" style="s2">legitimation or legitimacy crisis which</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.640" end="00:58:41.640" style="s2">is to say if you land in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.090" end="00:58:43.350" style="s2">institutional situation where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.640" end="00:58:44.820" style="s2">undercut teacherly authority in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.350" end="00:58:46.830" style="s2">places it needs to be able to show up</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.820" end="00:58:47.970" style="s2">and be detected then you&#39;ve undercut the</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.970" end="00:58:51.510" style="s2">transmission and if that goes long</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.560" end="00:58:53.730" style="s2">enough then even when you come forward</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.510" end="00:58:56.300" style="s2">as a legitimate teacher there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.730" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">who will assume the role of student and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.300" end="00:59:02.460" style="s2">some of this has had to do with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.280" end="00:59:03.810" style="s2">the way the schooling and family</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.460" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">structures and other things have been</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.450" style="s2">college I&#39;m actually taking out as much</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.790" end="01:00:57.000" style="s2">where does teacher Lee authority</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.260" end="01:00:58.950" style="s2">actually arise in those contexts right</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.000" end="01:01:03.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like in the back rooms it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.950" end="01:01:05.430" style="s2">the random you know fortuitous</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.530" end="01:01:08.190" style="s2">student-teacher relationship that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.430" end="01:01:10.560" style="s2">emerges it&#39;s not systemic it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.190" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">what&#39;s systemic in the system is this</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.560" end="01:01:14.790" style="s2">strategic relation between generations</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:17.400" style="s2">almost as a form of commodity exchange</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.790" end="01:01:19.260" style="s2">and so similarly it&#39;s like you know a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.400" end="01:01:22.470" style="s2">lot of teacher Lee authority resides</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.260" end="01:01:24.930" style="s2">with some mother if I knew that my mom</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.470" end="01:01:27.000" style="s2">was my mom because she was getting paid</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.930" end="01:01:28.500" style="s2">by the state let&#39;s say right this has</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.000" end="01:01:30.360" style="s2">been recommended like your mom didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.500" end="01:01:32.940" style="s2">get paid to take care of you when you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.360" end="01:01:35.370" style="s2">were little gym rat now should the state</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.940" end="01:01:37.650" style="s2">have paid her to do that and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.370" end="01:01:39.000" style="s2">actually monitored her behavior and paid</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.650" end="01:01:41.940" style="s2">her more if she was like a quote good</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.000" end="01:01:44.400" style="s2">mom right ah fuck bad right I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.940" end="01:01:47.780" style="s2">so it&#39;s like that actually would be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:49.860" style="s2">most devastating undermining of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.780" end="01:01:51.510" style="s2">intergenerational transmission you could</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.860" end="01:01:53.360" style="s2">imagine because it would undermine the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.510" end="01:01:55.500" style="s2">intergenerational transmission of love</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.360" end="01:01:57.030" style="s2">right there&#39;s this question okay my</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.500" end="01:01:59.010" style="s2">mom&#39;s nice to me why is my mom nice to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.030" end="01:02:00.210" style="s2">me cuz she loves me but then in the back</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.010" end="01:02:02.280" style="s2">of your mind there&#39;d be this</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.210" end="01:02:03.930" style="s2">oh no she&#39;s actually being nice to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.280" end="01:02:06.090" style="s2">because she&#39;s virtue signaling to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.930" end="01:02:10.140" style="s2">monitors who will pay her more all right</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.090" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">and so you have to understand how much</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.140" end="01:02:14.730" style="s2">we were approximating this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:15.870" style="s2">situation in many institutional contexts</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.730" end="01:02:21.420" style="s2">where intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.870" end="01:02:23.250" style="s2">takes place and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.420" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">undermining again just to reiterate the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.250" end="01:02:29.340" style="s2">undermining of teacherly authority has</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:32.090" style="s2">ramifications out into all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.340" end="01:02:36.750" style="s2">aspects of our institutional structures</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.090" end="01:02:38.820" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way for example to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.750" end="01:02:41.370" style="s2">out of the political crisis we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.820" end="01:02:43.110" style="s2">right now like with the Congress and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.370" end="01:02:44.760" style="s2">Senate and the president of the voting</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.110" end="01:02:47.220" style="s2">and all that stuff if you want to call</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.760" end="01:02:49.470" style="s2">that politics that whole situation</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.220" end="01:02:52.530" style="s2">hinges on this notion of legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.470" end="01:02:54.600" style="s2">teacherly Authority the whole problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.530" end="01:02:57.270" style="s2">with the informational ecosystem with</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.600" end="01:02:59.640" style="s2">kind of fake news and alternative facts</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.270" end="01:03:02.300" style="s2">and conspiracy is and then also like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.640" end="01:03:06.600" style="s2">blue church kind of like homogenized</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.300" end="01:03:10.020" style="s2">kind of like New York Times all of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.600" end="01:03:12.990" style="s2">is in question because teacherly</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.020" end="01:03:14.700" style="s2">Authority itself is in question so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.990" end="01:03:17.250" style="s2">we have to find a way to get into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.700" end="01:03:20.120" style="s2">position where we can first recognize</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.250" end="01:03:22.590" style="s2">this problem and then create new</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.120" end="01:03:24.900" style="s2">contexts in which actual teacherly</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.590" end="01:03:27.150" style="s2">Authority can re-emerge</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.900" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great I mean that is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.150" end="01:03:31.559" style="s2">heart of your book that I took away from</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:33.450" style="s2">it that you know as we move the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.559" end="01:03:36.359" style="s2">towards a better and new social</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.450" end="01:03:40.589" style="s2">operating system a nuanced and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.359" end="01:03:42.930" style="s2">distributed and non-dogmatic form of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.589" end="01:03:45.210" style="s2">teacherly authority broadly construed</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.930" end="01:03:47.759" style="s2">and that&#39;s and you make that point</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.210" end="01:03:49.140" style="s2">several times not somebody standing in</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.759" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">front of 30 kids</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.140" end="01:03:54.390" style="s2">tapping on their desk with their ruler</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:55.729" style="s2">is gonna be absolutely essential to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.390" end="01:03:58.380" style="s2">this not only an intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.729" end="01:03:59.700" style="s2">transfer but because we&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.380" end="01:04:02.279" style="s2">world where there&#39;s a demand for</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.700" end="01:04:04.499" style="s2">exponential increase in capacity it has</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.279" end="01:04:06.390" style="s2">to be an intergenerational upgrade</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.499" end="01:04:08.460" style="s2">between each generations which makes the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.390" end="01:04:09.989" style="s2">problem even more difficult now if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.460" end="01:04:12.900" style="s2">don&#39;t mind I got a few things I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.989" end="01:04:15.589" style="s2">to hit on that these comments brought</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.900" end="01:04:18.150" style="s2">forth one the tight linkage between</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.589" end="01:04:20.969" style="s2">teacherly Authority and parenting you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.150" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">mentioned it in places in the book but I</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.969" end="01:04:25.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t find that you developed it in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">really rich fashion and you could</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.319" end="01:04:29.069" style="s2">probably say more about that I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:31.650" style="s2">you a chance to do that in a bit and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.069" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">mentioned the criticality of mothers no</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.650" end="01:04:35.579" style="s2">doubt in my mind the most influential</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:37.799" style="s2">person in my life was my mother she was</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.579" end="01:04:39.420" style="s2">a great person in her own way we were up</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.799" end="01:04:42.089" style="s2">at a house without electricity or indoor</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.420" end="01:04:44.849" style="s2">plumbing left home when she was 14 made</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.089" end="01:04:46.619" style="s2">her way to DC when she was 16 saved up</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.849" end="01:04:48.809" style="s2">nickels dimes and quarters from being a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.619" end="01:04:50.729" style="s2">waitress but she was a great person in</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.809" end="01:04:52.859" style="s2">her own way and I would not be who I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.729" end="01:04:55.319" style="s2">without her and you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.859" end="01:04:57.900" style="s2">she was able to ask you status through</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.319" end="01:05:00.359" style="s2">stuff was what her allowed her to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.900" end="01:05:02.430" style="s2">that and all three of her kids got to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.359" end="01:05:04.380" style="s2">say we all had great lives and really</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.430" end="01:05:06.420" style="s2">solid citizens been very successful in</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.380" end="01:05:07.769" style="s2">our own very different domains and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.420" end="01:05:09.479" style="s2">basically because we had that great</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.769" end="01:05:11.640" style="s2">experience so I can also point out and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.479" end="01:05:14.910" style="s2">get another anecdotal story of my wife</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.640" end="01:05:17.130" style="s2">she taught headstart for a year and part</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.910" end="01:05:19.289" style="s2">of headstart was doing family visits and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.130" end="01:05:21.089" style="s2">so they visited the families of all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.289" end="01:05:24.089" style="s2">students at the end of the year she quit</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.089" end="01:05:25.380" style="s2">for two reasons one during the time she</p>

<p begin="01:05:27.150" end="01:05:34.499" style="s2">didn&#39;t stick and then the family visits</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.150" end="01:05:35.670" style="s2">told her that sorry these families are</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.499" end="01:05:37.410" style="s2">so dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.670" end="01:05:38.809" style="s2">couple of years where the Head Start is</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.410" end="01:05:43.309" style="s2">not gonna make much a deaf</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.809" end="01:05:46.779" style="s2">and so parenting and you know capacity</p>

<p begin="01:05:55.339" end="01:05:59.469" style="s2">specifically in your book that there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.349" end="01:06:02.509" style="s2">trends of so-called hyper progressive</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.669" end="01:06:17.630" style="s2">well I think some of that is good I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.169" end="01:06:19.519" style="s2">with you that you know as a full way to</p>

<p begin="01:06:19.519" end="01:06:24.049" style="s2">intergenerational upgrade of capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.739" end="01:06:28.039" style="s2">that does not strike me as likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.049" end="01:06:30.349" style="s2">successful and third the one you in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.039" end="01:06:32.799" style="s2">nice discussion there pointed to this</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.349" end="01:06:34.909" style="s2">undermining of all authority and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.799" end="01:06:36.169" style="s2">particularly teacher Lee authority and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.909" end="01:06:38.179" style="s2">parental authority there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.169" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">crazy-ass fuckin theories running around</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.179" end="01:06:42.259" style="s2">about parental authority right there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.539" style="s2">actually people who would advocate which</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.259" end="01:06:46.609" style="s2">we both laughed at I think I went beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.539" end="01:06:48.650" style="s2">laughing the idea of paying the mother</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.609" end="01:06:50.900" style="s2">and having social workers come in and</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.650" end="01:06:52.729" style="s2">assessor once a quarter and giving her a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.900" end="01:06:54.289" style="s2">grade give her a bonus I mean what the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.729" end="01:06:57.109" style="s2">fuck right but there are people</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.289" end="01:07:00.489" style="s2">advocating that and it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.109" end="01:07:04.069" style="s2">an awful lot of that rot comes from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.489" end="01:07:06.469" style="s2">capture of a fair amount of our academia</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.069" end="01:07:09.559" style="s2">particularly in education departments by</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.469" end="01:07:11.299" style="s2">what I call post modernists people who</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.559" end="01:07:13.909" style="s2">have lost their way in thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.299" end="01:07:16.459" style="s2">reality and have kind of generated these</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.909" end="01:07:19.279" style="s2">bizarre theories within theories that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.459" end="01:07:21.429" style="s2">just are not practical that have no real</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.429" end="01:07:26.119" style="s2">particularly in education schools those</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.259" end="01:07:29.749" style="s2">things have made considerable progress</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.119" end="01:07:31.669" style="s2">and have led to some really pretty crazy</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.749" end="01:07:34.309" style="s2">shit I give you one personal experience</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.669" end="01:07:37.069" style="s2">I was after I stepped down as chairman</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.309" end="01:07:39.169" style="s2">of SF I moved back to Virginia I started</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.069" end="01:07:41.239" style="s2">living at my farm again I took on a gig</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.169" end="01:07:43.429" style="s2">as a consultant to a major research</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.239" end="01:07:45.459" style="s2">university which will remain unnamed who</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.429" end="01:07:47.599" style="s2">wanted to establish a PhD</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:52.610" style="s2">cognitive science they had one of the</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.950" end="01:08:00.910" style="s2">a ph.d program and so I helped them for</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.410" end="01:08:04.250" style="s2">quite a while and we found tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.910" end="01:08:05.870" style="s2">support from all the other schools from</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.500" end="01:08:19.100" style="s2">department heads of a couple of the sub</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.270" end="01:08:22.370" style="s2">departments it was like we were like</p>

<p begin="01:08:22.370" end="01:08:26.780" style="s2">them some kind of crazy shit and what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.070" end="01:08:29.480" style="s2">were trying to sell was I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.780" end="01:08:31.640" style="s2">state-of-the-art cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.480" end="01:08:33.290" style="s2">and cognitive science and we looked at</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.640" end="01:08:35.480" style="s2">the courses they were offering and</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.290" end="01:08:38.030" style="s2">things like educational psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.480" end="01:08:40.520" style="s2">we were all saying this is 50 year old</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.030" end="01:08:43.430" style="s2">stuff and some of it wouldn&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.520" end="01:08:45.890" style="s2">been considered good psychology 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.430" end="01:08:47.330" style="s2">ago and you know I didn&#39;t know it at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.890" end="01:08:50.090" style="s2">time but the other folks that were more</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.090" end="01:08:53.630" style="s2">of Education you know again they pointed</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.070" end="01:08:55.660" style="s2">to the fact that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.630" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">particular school had been taken over by</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:01.370" style="s2">descended into a mouse room of nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.870" end="01:09:03.590" style="s2">and that we should not waste our time</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.370" end="01:09:05.240" style="s2">talking to him and we didn&#39;t so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.590" end="01:09:08.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a number of reactions I like to</p>

<p begin="01:09:28.780" end="01:09:37.250" style="s2">basically since it began and the trend</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.350" end="01:09:41.090" style="s2">has been scientific experts who are men</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.250" end="01:09:42.920" style="s2">come in and tell women who have 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.090" end="01:09:44.120" style="s2">of experience with young children that</p>

<p begin="01:09:45.590" end="01:09:50.810" style="s2">and if you look at the history of the IQ</p>

<p begin="01:12:28.410" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">version many teachers have and of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.810" end="01:12:37.390" style="s2">the post modernists in particular gives</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.390" end="01:12:42.610" style="s2">ratify these arguments I think more than</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.970" end="01:12:46.110" style="s2">they should the resistance comes from</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.610" end="01:12:49.060" style="s2">that long history of Education being</p>

<p begin="01:12:54.460" end="01:13:00.490" style="s2">that situation and then there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.820" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">question of what why is education the</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.490" end="01:13:05.260" style="s2">least well-off given that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:07.390" style="s2">freakin important right and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.260" end="01:13:08.530" style="s2">really interesting question and when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.390" end="01:13:10.030" style="s2">look especially at the history of</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.710" end="01:13:21.570" style="s2">and remained although a little bit less</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:24.940" style="s2">so primarily women who are underpaid</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.570" end="01:13:26.230" style="s2">given their skill capacity these</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.940" end="01:13:29.770" style="s2">educational systems have been the</p>

<p begin="01:13:33.580" end="01:13:38.110" style="s2">be noted as well when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.800" end="01:13:39.790" style="s2">well why did the post modernists take</p>

<p begin="01:13:39.790" end="01:13:45.550" style="s2">because the education has got the most</p>

<p begin="01:15:49.710" end="01:15:52.950" style="s2">like the state of graduate schools of</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.480" end="01:15:59.790" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been in this position of</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.490" end="01:16:11.310" style="s2">utter insane nonsense or I hardly</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.730" end="01:16:12.630" style="s2">progress but it&#39;s understandable yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.310" end="01:16:14.010" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s like the</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.010" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">engineers it&#39;s it&#39;s the people who came</p>

<p begin="01:16:18.960" end="01:16:24.270" style="s2">teachers yeah and thinking specifically</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.070" end="01:16:25.500" style="s2">and in a sense they did know better than</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.270" end="01:16:27.639" style="s2">the teachers about how to make the</p>

<p begin="01:16:37.840" end="01:16:41.980" style="s2">I&#39;m remembering the parenting one what</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.909" end="01:16:43.960" style="s2">was the one in the middle what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.980" end="01:16:45.969" style="s2">tendency among some people consider</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.960" end="01:16:48.699" style="s2">themselves educational progressives to</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.969" end="01:16:50.770" style="s2">move towards unschooling or raw learning</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.699" end="01:16:53.139" style="s2">or maker based learning that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.770" end="01:16:55.480" style="s2">imitative yeah I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.139" end="01:16:57.909" style="s2">in the kind of like unschooling</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.480" end="01:17:00.070" style="s2">movement like my book is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.909" end="01:17:03.550" style="s2">resuscitating Ivan Illich is arguments</p>

<p begin="01:17:03.550" end="01:17:08.619" style="s2">that in the interest of teacher Li</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.100" end="01:17:10.989" style="s2">Authority not as a protest against it</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.619" end="01:17:12.130" style="s2">and basically saying that because the</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.130" end="01:17:16.270" style="s2">run for so long it&#39;s going to be very</p>

<p begin="01:17:16.270" end="01:17:20.469" style="s2">to teach really Authority in those</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.650" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">contexts because it&#39;s like as soon as a</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.470" end="01:19:13.120" style="s2">the long run but they are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.660" end="01:19:15.580" style="s2">pockets like temporary autonomous zones</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.120" end="01:19:17.290" style="s2">in the educational space where you can</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.580" end="01:19:19.270" style="s2">get in and actually do amazing things</p>

<p begin="01:19:37.630" end="01:19:42.280" style="s2">Lee authority to arise it would be seen</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.390" end="01:19:45.520" style="s2">as suspect and maybe potentially</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.280" end="01:19:48.550" style="s2">undermining the kind of metrics by which</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.520" end="01:19:50.920" style="s2">the school is is gauged but in these</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.550" end="01:19:53.260" style="s2">autonomous areas where education is</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.920" end="01:19:54.430" style="s2">occurring much more spontaneously there</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.260" end="01:19:56.410" style="s2">still can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.430" end="01:19:59.350" style="s2">but if we start to design for it to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.410" end="01:20:01.090" style="s2">happen and again think about ways to</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.350" end="01:20:02.620" style="s2">create context where real legitimate</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.450" end="01:20:11.470" style="s2">situation so I do think that you know so</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.310" end="01:20:14.500" style="s2">think about it it&#39;s like if you watch</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.470" end="01:20:18.130" style="s2">Fox News then anytime you see something</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.500" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">on CNN or the New York Times you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.130" end="01:20:21.070" style="s2">going to buy it you&#39;re not gonna buy</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:23.050" style="s2">into the teacherly authority of the New</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.070" end="01:20:25.810" style="s2">York Times simply because it&#39;s the New</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.050" end="01:20:28.390" style="s2">York Times and vice versa so if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.810" end="01:20:30.220" style="s2">kid and you&#39;ve learned over the course</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.390" end="01:20:32.170" style="s2">of grade school and maybe up into middle</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.220" end="01:20:34.030" style="s2">school that</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.170" end="01:20:35.739" style="s2">these teachers aren&#39;t really all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.030" end="01:20:37.330" style="s2">cracked up to be and I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.739" end="01:20:39.219" style="s2">why I have to learn this instead of that</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.330" end="01:20:40.920" style="s2">and you know you&#39;re basically seeing</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.219" end="01:20:44.230" style="s2">through some of the illusion of school</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.920" end="01:20:45.369" style="s2">and then you in a school encounter a</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.230" end="01:20:47.170" style="s2">teacher who&#39;s legit</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.369" end="01:20:48.280" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna discount them simply by</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.170" end="01:20:50.980" style="s2">virtue of the fact that they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.280" end="01:20:54.400" style="s2">school right so I really think that</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.980" end="01:20:55.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone quite far down of trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.400" end="01:20:57.489" style="s2">that has undermine teach really</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.719" end="01:20:59.770" style="s2">Authority in the schools and I blame the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.489" end="01:21:01.780" style="s2">standardized tests primarily because</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.770" end="01:21:04.210" style="s2">everyone knows that the interests of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.780" end="01:21:07.719" style="s2">teachers actually to get the kids to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.210" end="01:21:09.909" style="s2">well on the tests even if he loves the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.719" end="01:21:11.469" style="s2">kids all right and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.909" end="01:21:13.090" style="s2">potential and she&#39;s super smart and</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.469" end="01:21:16.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a potential for real authentic</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.090" end="01:21:18.460" style="s2">teacher Lee Authority to emerge at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.510" end="01:21:20.350" style="s2">end of the day the overarching</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.460" end="01:21:23.199" style="s2">motivation of the school and everyone in</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.350" end="01:21:25.030" style="s2">it is to pass tests that have a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.199" end="01:21:28.360" style="s2">specific content and a very specific</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.030" end="01:21:31.090" style="s2">assessment type of modality and again</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.360" end="01:21:32.409" style="s2">that&#39;s highly unnatural from the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.090" end="01:21:34.389" style="s2">perspective of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.409" end="01:21:36.159" style="s2">transmission whereas if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.389" end="01:21:37.989" style="s2">apprenticeship model and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.159" end="01:21:39.520" style="s2">concretely working every day on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.989" end="01:21:41.290" style="s2">problems together that you both care</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.520" end="01:21:44.409" style="s2">about you don&#39;t need a standardized test</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.290" end="01:21:47.320" style="s2">at the end every day there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.409" end="01:21:49.719" style="s2">assessment instances there&#39;s multiple</p>

<p begin="01:21:49.719" end="01:21:53.739" style="s2">and learning that&#39;s taking place so</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.730" end="01:21:58.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a little bit on that and</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.739" end="01:22:00.760" style="s2">then yet parenting is in a sense the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.119" end="01:22:04.000" style="s2">other place where education has been</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.760" end="01:22:05.949" style="s2">kind of relegated to in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.000" end="01:22:09.790" style="s2">right so we think of like the schools</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.949" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">and we think of the home and these are</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.790" end="01:22:14.469" style="s2">the places that are like saddled with</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:17.800" style="s2">the burden of accomplishing democracy</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.469" end="01:22:20.969" style="s2">right and so blame the teachers blame</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.800" end="01:22:23.560" style="s2">the moms if you want to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.969" end="01:22:25.480" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong but what you have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.560" end="01:22:27.550" style="s2">understand about the breakdown of family</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.480" end="01:22:29.920" style="s2">structures is that it&#39;s not a moral</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.550" end="01:22:31.719" style="s2">failing it&#39;s at the level of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.920" end="01:22:33.610" style="s2">individuals in the family it&#39;s a moral</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.719" end="01:22:37.060" style="s2">failing at the level of the society</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.610" end="01:22:38.590" style="s2">which allows society to exist with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.060" end="01:22:39.550" style="s2">much for example inequitable</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.590" end="01:22:42.610" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.550" end="01:22:45.429" style="s2">right so the question of why your wife</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.610" end="01:22:47.590" style="s2">when she went in to the Head Start home</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.429" end="01:22:48.369" style="s2">visits why those families were so</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.590" end="01:22:51.010" style="s2">dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.369" end="01:22:52.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a macroeconomic question what</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.010" end="01:22:54.250" style="s2">immediately confront you is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.270" end="01:22:55.960" style="s2">psychological and sociological question</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.250" end="01:22:57.610" style="s2">questions about attachment theory</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.960" end="01:22:58.090" style="s2">questions about trauma and things of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.610" end="01:23:00.940" style="s2">that nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.090" end="01:23:02.590" style="s2">but if you pull out and look for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.940" end="01:23:05.949" style="s2">generator function of families like that</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.590" end="01:23:07.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not in a moral failing of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.949" end="01:23:12.909" style="s2">individual it&#39;s in the moral failing of</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.900" end="01:23:16.360" style="s2">the society and so again I am hugely</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.909" end="01:23:18.280" style="s2">support the notion that the family is</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.360" end="01:23:21.400" style="s2">actually at the core of civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.280" end="01:23:23.860" style="s2">redesign but that is the most dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.400" end="01:23:25.860" style="s2">thing to say as well and so here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.860" end="01:23:27.969" style="s2">I&#39;m basically getting at which is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.860" end="01:23:29.710" style="s2">the insight that the family is so</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.969" end="01:23:31.300" style="s2">important is what leads to the insanity</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.710" end="01:23:32.889" style="s2">of wanting social workers to monitor</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.300" end="01:23:34.809" style="s2">every mother and wanting there to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.889" end="01:23:37.179" style="s2">parenting licenses and parenting</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.809" end="01:23:38.380" style="s2">mandatory parenting curriculum and these</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.179" end="01:23:40.510" style="s2">kinds of things that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.380" end="01:23:42.340" style="s2">Orwellian shitshow you can possibly</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.510" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">imagine if you have a civilization</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.340" end="01:23:47.530" style="s2">that&#39;s micromanaging familial life right</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:50.050" style="s2">the need to micromanage familial life</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.530" end="01:23:52.260" style="s2">only takes place if the environments in</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.050" end="01:23:55.780" style="s2">which families grow are devoid of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.260" end="01:23:58.989" style="s2">nutrients right which is to say like if</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.780" end="01:24:02.559" style="s2">you plant a family in a cultural and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.989" end="01:24:04.869" style="s2">social contexts where normal healthy</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.559" end="01:24:07.239" style="s2">human interaction isn&#39;t possible then</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.869" end="01:24:09.699" style="s2">you have to go in and try to force them</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.239" end="01:24:11.679" style="s2">to do that if you could create enough</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.699" end="01:24:13.290" style="s2">and then back to my social miracles</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.679" end="01:24:17.170" style="s2">chapter if you could create enough</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.290" end="01:24:19.570" style="s2">surrounding the family then you could</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.170" end="01:24:22.500" style="s2">actually ask people to step into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.570" end="01:24:25.059" style="s2">responsibility of being in a family</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.500" end="01:24:26.980" style="s2">instead what you&#39;re doing is asking</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.059" end="01:24:29.199" style="s2">people to step into the responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.980" end="01:24:31.630" style="s2">of contributing to the economy and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.199" end="01:24:33.340" style="s2">the family takes on the externalities of</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.630" end="01:24:35.829" style="s2">that right the families one of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.340" end="01:24:38.650" style="s2">places and actually literally the minds</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.829" end="01:24:40.929" style="s2">and the brains of the youth are part of</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.650" end="01:24:42.940" style="s2">the places where we actually deposit the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.929" end="01:24:46.780" style="s2">externalities of our current social</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.940" end="01:24:48.429" style="s2">system and so until we flip that then</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.780" end="01:24:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no use and actually kind</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.429" end="01:24:51.630" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.440" end="01:24:53.730" style="s2">lamenting the state of parenting and</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.630" end="01:24:55.890" style="s2">getting angry and irresponsible parents</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.730" end="01:24:57.750" style="s2">and all of that stuff and that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.890" end="01:25:01.230" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s said by like middle-class</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.750" end="01:25:02.730" style="s2">white people you know like it&#39;s when you</p>

<p begin="01:25:04.380" end="01:25:08.520" style="s2">foremost so what the hell is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.610" end="01:25:11.090" style="s2">economics around this family and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.520" end="01:25:14.340" style="s2">know in Vermont like you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.090" end="01:25:16.380" style="s2">generational rural poverty generational</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.340" end="01:25:18.180" style="s2">rural poverty which has to do with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.380" end="01:25:21.930" style="s2">of things like agricultural subsidies</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.180" end="01:25:24.270" style="s2">and changes in manufacturing locations</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.930" end="01:25:27.739" style="s2">and all that stuff probably similar to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.270" end="01:25:30.350" style="s2">rural Virginia and what you have our</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.739" end="01:25:33.960" style="s2">families and situations that are</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.350" end="01:25:35.670" style="s2">basically it&#39;s extremely difficult to to</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.960" end="01:25:37.530" style="s2">understand how these how these folks</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.670" end="01:25:40.020" style="s2">actually get by let alone how they</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.530" end="01:25:44.550" style="s2">manage to have loving conversations</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.020" end="01:25:47.340" style="s2">around dinner tables reliably and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.550" end="01:25:49.350" style="s2">know there is some sense that those are</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.340" end="01:25:54.810" style="s2">the same people who are also you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.350" end="01:25:57.239" style="s2">voting for Trump and who are also not</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.810" end="01:25:59.430" style="s2">believing in climate change and who are</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.239" end="01:26:01.680" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s this like cluster of</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.430" end="01:26:03.810" style="s2">things which are occurring which we like</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.680" end="01:26:06.480" style="s2">to read as almost like there&#39;s the moral</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.810" end="01:26:08.750" style="s2">failings of these people and similar to</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.480" end="01:26:11.910" style="s2">the way when a child struggles in school</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.750" end="01:26:13.949" style="s2">we blame the child and eventually we</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.910" end="01:26:15.870" style="s2">blame their brain and we give them ADHD</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.949" end="01:26:19.880" style="s2">medication right it never occurs to us</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.870" end="01:26:22.380" style="s2">to blame the school when the child fails</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.880" end="01:26:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly it&#39;s certainly the last</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.380" end="01:26:27.600" style="s2">place I would put attention is on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.840" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">child&#39;s nervous system the first thing I</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.600" end="01:26:31.770" style="s2">would look at is the context in which</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.040" end="01:26:36.060" style="s2">the child is trying to do the work</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.770" end="01:26:38.940" style="s2">and so similarly with with the need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.060" end="01:26:44.310" style="s2">think about how to help families and how</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.940" end="01:26:47.310" style="s2">to kind of like revivify the virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.310" end="01:26:48.660" style="s2">value of family life and I think for the</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.310" end="01:26:50.340" style="s2">sake of intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.660" end="01:26:53.310" style="s2">and true teacherly Authority and just</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.340" end="01:26:54.660" style="s2">like sanity same argument as education</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.310" end="01:26:56.489" style="s2">reform right don&#39;t focus on the school</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.660" end="01:26:57.050" style="s2">don&#39;t focus on the family focus on what</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.489" end="01:26:59.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.050" end="01:27:01.040" style="s2">pounding it focusing on all the things</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.240" end="01:27:03.440" style="s2">that use the family to offload</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.040" end="01:27:06.680" style="s2">externalities that use the family as a</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.440" end="01:27:08.480" style="s2">point of extraction and rent-seeking the</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.680" end="01:27:10.550" style="s2">families preyed upon</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.480" end="01:27:13.550" style="s2">and yet we blame the family for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.550" end="01:27:15.050" style="s2">breakdown of family values and so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.550" end="01:27:16.670" style="s2">that&#39;s some of my view and it&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.050" end="01:27:19.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t blame the schools for</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.670" end="01:27:22.040" style="s2">the failure of democracy and there</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.940" end="01:27:23.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge potential scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.040" end="01:27:24.830" style="s2">teachers in particular huge potential</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.930" end="01:27:26.690" style="s2">scapegoats</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.830" end="01:27:27.890" style="s2">when everyone pointing fingers at them</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.690" end="01:27:29.690" style="s2">should actually be pointing fingers with</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.890" end="01:27:32.060" style="s2">themselves usually business leaders etc</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.690" end="01:27:34.880" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s a little bit more on your</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.060" end="01:27:36.050" style="s2">reactions me yeah I say that fits in to</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.880" end="01:27:38.510" style="s2">what we talked about earlier about the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.050" end="01:27:41.480" style="s2">complex coupled systems nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.510" end="01:27:44.540" style="s2">problem there is no one point fix in a</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.480" end="01:27:46.670" style="s2">complex system typically right and at</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.540" end="01:27:49.070" style="s2">least our game be fair is we have to Co</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.670" end="01:27:51.260" style="s2">evolve our institutions and our people</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.070" end="01:27:53.060" style="s2">together more or less over probably two</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.260" end="01:27:55.010" style="s2">or three generations to solve these</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.060" end="01:27:58.010" style="s2">problems no silver bullets right</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.010" end="01:28:00.530" style="s2">unfortunately we&#39;re getting kind of far</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.010" end="01:28:03.020" style="s2">into our time here and as we discussed</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.530" end="01:28:05.720" style="s2">prior to show time we&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.020" end="01:28:08.540" style="s2">second episode probably in a month or</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.720" end="01:28:11.120" style="s2">two and hit the other half of my topic</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.540" end="01:28:13.040" style="s2">notes Zacks book is so rich I just</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.120" end="01:28:15.380" style="s2">recommend you should read it there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.040" end="01:28:18.020" style="s2">way we can do a justice in one 90-minute</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.380" end="01:28:19.460" style="s2">session but one last topic I think this</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.020" end="01:28:21.890" style="s2">is one that a lot of people will find</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.460" end="01:28:24.350" style="s2">interesting and scary and controversial</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.890" end="01:28:27.380" style="s2">and lots of other things before we wrap</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.350" end="01:28:30.830" style="s2">up today you write very passionately</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.380" end="01:28:32.930" style="s2">about the pharmacological ization of K</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.830" end="01:28:36.910" style="s2">through 12 education and particularly</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.930" end="01:28:40.490" style="s2">this proliferation of ADHD and similar</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.910" end="01:28:43.100" style="s2">diagnoses particularly for boys in the K</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.490" end="01:28:45.980" style="s2">to 12 system and the attempts to douse</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.100" end="01:28:48.530" style="s2">them with various chemicals and that is</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.980" end="01:28:50.750" style="s2">being a canary in the coal mine at least</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.530" end="01:28:52.430" style="s2">and maybe even more than that so why</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.750" end="01:28:55.210" style="s2">don&#39;t you talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.430" end="01:28:57.900" style="s2">pharmacal is Asian and medicalization of</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.210" end="01:29:01.100" style="s2">K to 12 education</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.900" end="01:29:03.750" style="s2">totally and this is of course a very</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.100" end="01:29:09.500" style="s2">controversial topic right when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.750" end="01:29:13.650" style="s2">spoken about ADHD medication ad D the</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.500" end="01:29:15.540" style="s2">rapid not quite exponential but probably</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.650" end="01:29:18.929" style="s2">now with the pandemic approaching</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.540" end="01:29:21.690" style="s2">exponential growth rates of psychotropic</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.929" end="01:29:24.060" style="s2">drug prescription to children when I</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.690" end="01:29:26.880" style="s2">speak about these things I often get a</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.060" end="01:29:29.820" style="s2">lot of pushback it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.880" end="01:29:33.199" style="s2">and the push backs on multiple levels</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.820" end="01:29:35.850" style="s2">some of it comes from confusion about</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.199" end="01:29:37.949" style="s2">the nature of what a disease entity is</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.850" end="01:29:41.100" style="s2">and the nature of how the brain works</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.949" end="01:29:44.070" style="s2">and how these drugs actually act on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.100" end="01:29:48.690" style="s2">nervous system but some of it comes from</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.070" end="01:29:52.199" style="s2">the perceived dire situation of many</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.690" end="01:29:54.840" style="s2">young people within the schools and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.199" end="01:29:56.940" style="s2">perception that failing in the schools</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.840" end="01:29:58.920" style="s2">ends up having ramifications for the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.940" end="01:30:01.080" style="s2">rest of your life so what this means is</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.920" end="01:30:03.960" style="s2">that those people who will probably</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.080" end="01:30:07.500" style="s2">react to what I&#39;m gonna unfold here I</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.960" end="01:30:09.960" style="s2">have tremendous sympathy in fact for</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.500" end="01:30:14.870" style="s2">just how dire the situation is for many</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.960" end="01:30:18.420" style="s2">young boys in schools and understand the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.870" end="01:30:20.370" style="s2">the kind of almost overwhelming sense of</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.420" end="01:30:22.500" style="s2">obligation one has as a parent sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.370" end="01:30:25.699" style="s2">as a teacher or administrator to try to</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.500" end="01:30:29.880" style="s2">help those kids like whatever it takes</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.699" end="01:30:32.429" style="s2">and what I&#39;m trying to do when I speak</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.880" end="01:30:36.630" style="s2">about these things is provide a language</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.429" end="01:30:38.969" style="s2">that can be used to kind of make better</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.630" end="01:30:42.030" style="s2">sense of what the decision is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.969" end="01:30:44.780" style="s2">actually making when we decide to put a</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.030" end="01:30:46.830" style="s2">child on a psychotropic drug to</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.780" end="01:30:50.489" style="s2">positively impact educational</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.830" end="01:30:52.560" style="s2">performance and so you mentioned it in</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.489" end="01:30:55.679" style="s2">this if it comes down the medicalization</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.560" end="01:30:58.980" style="s2">of academic underperformance</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.679" end="01:31:04.650" style="s2">is the issue right so the medicalization</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.980" end="01:31:06.840" style="s2">of academic underperformance turns the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.650" end="01:31:08.429" style="s2">dynamic of teacherly Authority</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.840" end="01:31:11.400" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.429" end="01:31:14.909" style="s2">necessarily into a strategic one and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.400" end="01:31:16.559" style="s2">ends up undermining a whole bunch of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.909" end="01:31:19.499" style="s2">conditions for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.559" end="01:31:21.389" style="s2">certain forms of identity formation in</p>

<p begin="01:31:21.389" end="01:31:29.119" style="s2">transmission so I&#39;m actually not going</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.739" end="01:31:32.610" style="s2">to talk about the science of ADHD and</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.119" end="01:31:36.300" style="s2">the dynamics of psycho psycho</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.610" end="01:31:39.179" style="s2">pharmacological interventions from a</p>

<p begin="01:31:39.179" end="01:31:43.439" style="s2">worth saying that and this gets back to</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.400" end="01:31:45.510" style="s2">the broader crisis of teacherly</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.439" end="01:31:48.840" style="s2">Authority it&#39;s worth saying that there</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.510" end="01:31:55.229" style="s2">has been a massive tendency for bias</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.840" end="01:31:56.519" style="s2">within ADHD research and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.229" end="01:31:59.159" style="s2">not gonna get into a broader</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.519" end="01:32:01.709" style="s2">conversation about you know how</p>

<p begin="01:42:16.040" end="01:42:20.480" style="s2">worth understanding is that these are</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.080" end="01:42:23.480" style="s2">class two substances like this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.480" end="01:42:25.510" style="s2">basically speed and you know ridden</p>

<p begin="01:42:35.930" end="01:42:40.430" style="s2">interesting is that in the Army you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.570" end="01:42:43.580" style="s2">the Nazis were actually the first ones</p>

<p begin="01:42:43.580" end="01:42:48.500" style="s2">how could those some bitches march like</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.320" end="01:42:51.260" style="s2">that surgery so that&#39;s where it starts</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.500" end="01:42:54.700" style="s2">and of course the IQ testing also starts</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.260" end="01:42:57.860" style="s2">with the Nazis people don&#39;t realize it</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.700" end="01:42:59.870" style="s2">but so then the Americans emulate that</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.860" end="01:43:01.550" style="s2">in the military with the IQ testing and</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.870" end="01:43:03.410" style="s2">these and the amphetamines and then they</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.550" end="01:43:05.300" style="s2">bring both the amphetamines and the IQ</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.410" end="01:43:07.220" style="s2">testing into the schools now that people</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.300" end="01:43:09.020" style="s2">also forget the Nazis got their ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.220" end="01:43:10.940" style="s2">eugenics from the American yet so</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.020" end="01:43:13.460" style="s2">Margaret Sanger those people they were</p>

<p begin="01:43:18.530" end="01:43:22.940" style="s2">wrap up again and this issue that these</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.960" end="01:43:26.210" style="s2">problems seem to be infecting boys more</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.940" end="01:43:28.190" style="s2">than girls strikes me as real and it</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.210" end="01:43:29.750" style="s2">resonates with one of my very favorite</p>

<p begin="01:46:07.079" end="01:46:12.260" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot to say there but if</p>

<p begin="01:48:00.400" end="01:48:05.440" style="s2">is that they don&#39;t want to get sued</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.120" end="01:48:07.270" style="s2">exactly and so you have to look again</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.440" end="01:48:08.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that the schools in the</p>

<p begin="01:48:36.790" end="01:48:41.080" style="s2">freedom that we had when we were kids to</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.860" end="01:48:43.770" style="s2">like work together as adolescents to</p>

<p begin="01:48:51.910" end="01:48:56.560" style="s2">and that they are designed by us more or</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.490" end="01:48:58.630" style="s2">less to perpetuate the economic system</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.560" end="01:49:01.150" style="s2">that we created which it manages us and</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.630" end="01:49:04.420" style="s2">systemically disadvantages them and that</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.150" end="01:49:07.600" style="s2">begins with taking away recess and</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.420" end="01:49:09.820" style="s2">taking the spirit out of the boys who</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.600" end="01:49:11.890" style="s2">would otherwise have been leaders of men</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.820" end="01:49:14.230" style="s2">yeah don&#39;t let them fight I mean here</p>
