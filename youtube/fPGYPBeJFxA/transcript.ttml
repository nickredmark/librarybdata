<p begin="00:00:00.380" end="00:00:04.380" style="s2">actually is the power of the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.550" end="00:00:15.450" style="s2">vote and I think the people should use</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">it to vote for okay so in this series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.450" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">videos as I said in the introduction I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">gonna try and make the case in more</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">detail for none of the above as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">serious political campaign there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">to be three possibly four of these in</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">total in this particular video I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:31.949" style="s2">explore the potential that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:35.130" style="s2">above has for inclusivity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.949" end="00:00:38.820" style="s2">unification of people from a wide range</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.130" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">of very disparate walks of life and once</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.820" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">again there&#39;s a few strands to this so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">the first one is unifying activists</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">around the world and I use both of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.180" style="s2">words in their broadest possible sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">so by activists what I mean is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:54.539" style="s2">necessarily people who are out on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">street with placards or blocking gates</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">or whatever it might be but people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">are working in some way or another to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">try and make life better for people and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">so you know just to give a very few</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">examples you&#39;ve got people working to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">alleviate trial poverty anti-war</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">protesters environmental protesters</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">people looking to live communal lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">you know sustainable communal lives AIDS</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">and Refugee workers all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">just just to give a handful of examples</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">and Chai&#39;s are Charles Eisenstein in his</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">work points to this idea that all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">these people are in fact on the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">side these are individuals and small</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">groups of people working to help others</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">basically and there are potentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">hundreds of millions of these people</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">around the world but because you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">each individual or small group is doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">their own thing they have very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">voices they&#39;re all campaigning for or</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">working for very different things even</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">within a particular activist community</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">like I mentioned in the first video I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">part of the resource-based economics</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:04.189" style="s2">movement and even within that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">dozens possibly even hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.189" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">individuals and small groups and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">couple of larger groups working in their</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">own particular way towards bringing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">resource-based economics into the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">but they disagree on how best to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">about doing that and you know some think</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">it&#39;s about education others think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:26.190" style="s2">about political campaigning other think</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">others think it&#39;s about creating the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.190" end="00:02:30.210" style="s2">systems and you know working</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">independently of the existing structures</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.210" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">and institutions and they kind of fall</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">out with each other even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.330" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">all on the same side two things to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">all of these arguments go away under</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">none of the above because they can all</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">agree that well whatever particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">route we think says bring it to public</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">awareness no to remember is all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">creating a forum in which ideas can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">discussed and so it accomplishes that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">it&#39;s also something that can run us</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">alongside and does not conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:02:59.480" style="s2">what people are already doing so all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">those people that I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.480" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">could continue doing what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:06.330" style="s2">because that&#39;s what they care about but</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">they could also campaign for and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.330" end="00:03:10.320" style="s2">manifest and convince other people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">vote for none of the above</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.320" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">you know I&#39;m voting none of the above</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:20.070" style="s2">because and this is in recognition of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">the fact that all of these people all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.070" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">these campaigners all of these activists</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:27.930" style="s2">all of these aid workers are only having</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">to do what they do because of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.930" end="00:03:32.820" style="s2">shortcomings of our of the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">we use to organize ourselves and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.820" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">things like extreme poverty when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:39.300" style="s2">plenty of food to feed everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.930" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">things like millions of people dying of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.300" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">AIDS when there&#39;s plenty of medication</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">to treat everybody things like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.890" style="s2">answers to the continued unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">extraction of resources year in year out</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.890" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">getting more and more intensive doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">more and more damaged all of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">things are forms of pollution emitted by</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">our systems into the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to go into this in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">more detail in a future video but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">point anyway the overarching point of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:02.760" style="s2">this first bit is that having all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">these disparate groups all of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.760" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">disparate individuals weakens the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:09.000" style="s2">overall message that this is not working</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">we need something different we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">fundamental re-evaluations we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:16.080" style="s2">fundamental structural changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.280" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">way that we do things I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:19.970" style="s2">worth mentioning extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">and this is a very recent example of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">successful popular movement successful</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">in the sense that it got a lot of play</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:29.830" style="s2">in the media a lot of attend</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">and they did two things very well</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.830" end="00:04:33.250" style="s2">firstly they had an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:34.660" style="s2">organizational structure where you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">when once people have been recruited to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.660" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">the movement they had a sense of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">involvement through training sessions</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">and simulations and education and so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:45.370" style="s2">and so on but even more importantly than</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:47.650" style="s2">that they had a single message that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.370" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">everybody got behind you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.650" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2">government needs to do something</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:51.700" style="s2">immediately about climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">these are our three demands and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.700" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2">everybody was on exactly the same page</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:59.530" style="s2">and so I think it&#39;s worth noting as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">recent example the power of a single</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.530" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">message rather than a disparate one lots</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:07.660" style="s2">of people lots of different concerns the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:09.010" style="s2">second part is this I mean this varies</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:10.900" style="s2">significantly from country to country</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.010" end="00:05:13.240" style="s2">but you know let&#39;s say for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.900" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">argument that some 30 percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">don&#39;t vote at all it elections and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:20.830" style="s2">think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">large part that is because they just</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.830" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">can&#39;t get behind any of the candidates</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">and I mean I I know lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">people who do vote but they are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.500" end="00:05:29.470" style="s2">particularly happy about who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">voting for is just the choices they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.470" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">presented with is nothing there to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">excited about and so I think for all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:39.040" style="s2">these kinds of people that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:41.760" style="s2">above again could be an umbrella to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.040" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">under which these people could stand</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.760" end="00:05:46.780" style="s2">because it makes the vote makes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">remote vote meaningful again you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.780" end="00:05:49.750" style="s2">instead of wasting a vote on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:51.580" style="s2">that you hate or wasting your vote by</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.750" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">not voting at all or wasting your vote</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.580" end="00:05:55.900" style="s2">on some party who in a constituency</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">based system has absolutely no chance of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.900" end="00:06:00.820" style="s2">getting a representative in Parliament</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">you could be part of something bigger</p>
