<p begin="00:00:14.349" end="00:00:18.430" style="s2">difficult of all questions but a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.090" end="00:00:22.149" style="s2">very very difficult question it&#39;s akin</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.430" end="00:00:26.079" style="s2">to asking what is the Dow what is God</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.149" end="00:00:28.119" style="s2">that kind of thing not that game B is</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.079" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">God that&#39;s that&#39;s not the point but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.119" end="00:00:38.050" style="s2">is okay so if game a is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:43.030" style="s2">individuals collaborating with each</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.050" end="00:00:47.559" style="s2">other game B is a web of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.030" end="00:00:49.929" style="s2">made up of individuals doing so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.559" end="00:00:55.690" style="s2">thing that the emphasis is completely</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.929" end="00:00:59.829" style="s2">different so the basic premise of game B</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.690" end="00:01:01.690" style="s2">is that it focuses on the space between</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.829" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">the individuals the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.690" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">between them and the web the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">interconnectedness of the web</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">if game a is blasphemous and game B is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.260" end="00:01:22.090" style="s2">holy</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:25.330" style="s2">it is the game that tries to reestablish</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.090" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">the holy symmetry between humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.330" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">nature realigning the Axis Mundi</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:45.190" style="s2">but the anima Mundi may spin around it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:48.160" style="s2">to each their own axis how to realign</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.190" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">the spines of all the players of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.160" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">game be the source of good gameplay and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">aligned spine and then a good spin a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.790" end="00:02:16.630" style="s2">holy idea I think is really important so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">if if game a is gross and game B is holy</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.630" end="00:02:22.180" style="s2">gain B honors the holes this is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:26.590" style="s2">holy is right it&#39;s the holes it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.180" end="00:02:29.980" style="s2">spaces it&#39;s the lacunae right and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.590" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">again it&#39;s the space between that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.980" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">is that that is the crucial thing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:38.260" style="s2">focus on and it&#39;s very very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:40.420" style="s2">start thinking o crypto currencies would</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.260" end="00:02:42.100" style="s2">be game B this kind of thing but no no</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.420" end="00:02:46.840" style="s2">no no that&#39;s that&#39;s that that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.100" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">the point game B isn&#39;t concrete notions</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:53.620" style="s2">of systems game B is the soil from which</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:55.630" style="s2">emerges what needs to emerge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.620" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2">that&#39;s the point and so the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">game B is not about designing new</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.269" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">systems designing infrastructures it&#39;s</p>
