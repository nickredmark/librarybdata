<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">currently hiring for a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">analyst so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m really excited to hear uh what joe</p>

<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">with a focus on transforming insights</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">gleaned from complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">science into practical and implementable</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">strategies</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">and tactics for grappling with an</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">increasingly uncertain</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">founder of applied complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">llc he lives in new hampshire with his</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">wife where they are focusing their</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">what for those of us who are still</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">struggling to understand what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">complexity and what is applied</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">complexity i guess can you share</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">your your understanding of how you use</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">the term complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">and what applied complexity sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">means to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">yeah absolutely um so complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">complex system science</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">the idea of complex system science in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">its essence is really looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">at how things interact</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">and how those interactions give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">properties and behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">of systems um that you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">be able to discover or observe</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">if you break the system down into</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">isolated components and study it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of the complement or or it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">contains the complement to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">reductionism a reductionist approach to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">where the driving philosophy is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">that you have a system you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">in you&#39;re interested in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">uh behaviors or aspects of that system</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">and you want to break it down into its</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">smallest pieces generally and study</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">and the the thinking goes the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">goes of reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">that you&#39;ll be able to put those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">back together again in a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">straightforward way</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">and understand how the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">works based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">studying just those parts cut apart</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">literally analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">split into parts and dissected into</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">pieces so it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">um when you dissect a system and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t allow the components to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">interact anymore</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">um and it&#39;s really now on all under this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">umbrella of complex system science</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">and the thing about that is when we when</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">we go to actually apply</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">uh what we learn from complex system</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">science it turns out there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">for what it means to apply science um</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">it looks a little different than applied</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">science might generally look which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">often thought of as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">uh taking some known facts about some</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">system and applying it to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">technology for instance</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">this is more about what are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">and and kind of uh meta lessons we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">learning from studying complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">and what are the implications from those</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">for when we interact with complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">systems in the world when we intervene</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">with them when we attempt to synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">them etc</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">um so so that&#39;s sort of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">then a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">gesture in the direction of applied</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">does that kind of make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m thinking of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">this might be a weird parallel to draw</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">but the movement between um</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">sort of like the rationality community</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">and then the fact that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">applied rationality</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">um sort of branch of that that looks at</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve taken all these lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">this way of seeing the world and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">how we actually apply it in real life</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">and what i&#39;ve found is that the practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">often looks a little bit different than</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">what the theory suggests</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering joe um</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">what are some of the ways that we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">be able to spot a complex situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">or a place in which applied complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">might be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">and what are some of the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">an applied complexity wizard might be uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">drawn to using so</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">spotting it you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">complex systems you know complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">one of those things that you often hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">like you know when you see it right</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">but the truth is that one of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">insights that comes out of studying</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve done a bit of an inversion</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">with science</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">where we&#39;ve treated very special kinds</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">of systems linear systems simple systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">isolated systems equilibrium systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">as the general case and we&#39;ve treated</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">complex systems as a kind of special</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">of a very particular kind of arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">of these these more general simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">when in fact uh the world that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">encounter the world that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">interacting in and acting in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">complexity is the general case almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">everything that we interact with in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">sense by definition if we&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">with it it&#39;s now a non-isolated system</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">so complexity is everywhere pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">every problem we&#39;re looking at in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">world right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">is a complex problem the parts are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">independent</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">they are interdependent and uh when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">push over here</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">things happen over here and over here</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">and you can&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">a priori track all those relationships i</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">mean for many reasons there&#39;s opacity of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">the system in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">um is there just too much to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:47.839" style="s2">how the causal paths might be arranged</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">what might actually be touching what in</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">some sense so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">the the spotting of complexity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">almost trivial</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">it&#39;s almost trivial um it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">less trivial to spot the cases where we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">could actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">apply um linear models or</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">or equilibrium models and and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">actually hold</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">in any set of relevant conditions um</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">and so tools to bring to bear so so</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of modeling tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">associated with um complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">for the reason that they draw out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">of these features that i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">multiple parts that are interacting a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">lot and those interactions become</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">relevant to the to the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">um so it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">which tools you bring as how you use</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">and so for instance if you let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">you&#39;re building a computational model of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">some system</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">a say the global air travel system</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">and you&#39;re interested in looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">pandemics or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">the idea in applied complexity isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">necessarily to try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">build a faithful model of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">then use it to predict the future states</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">so much as to to surface the assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">that become very explicit as you build</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">the model</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">and then to start probing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">questioning those assumptions are these</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">the right assumptions are they the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">if they&#39;re the right assumptions then uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">you you might get something where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">can do something like prediction or</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">forecasting but that&#39;s very rare</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">and most of the time you have in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">complex system some</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">incorrect assumptions and spotting and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">finding those and finding the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">are are critical is uh exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">should be doing with models in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">practice now of course if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">theoretical work and uh you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">in the lab and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">concerned with the real world so to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">speak then</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways to go but when</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re applying these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">you it&#39;s it&#39;s truly critical to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">um question your own assumptions and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">models help to surface those so things</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">like agent-based models</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">um are are really helpful in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">cool so sort of what i&#39;m hearing from</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">you is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">complexity there&#39;s not really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">use cases where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">useful to say let&#39;s point at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">complexity here it&#39;s kind of like saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">um it&#39;s almost more rare to say this</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">this situation is actually not complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the more rare</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">thing to spot</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">and in terms of i mean things things in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">general are not not isolated</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">things in general are are touching</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">interconnected yeah and i think you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">mentioning that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">one might do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">rather than trying to build a model to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">predict um what you&#39;d want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">actually look at the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">assumptions that you&#39;re using to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">the model</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the interest lies um</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">so at this point i&#39;d like to welcome</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">other people to start dropping in more</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">into the chat um whatever&#39;s been coming</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.760" style="s2">up for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">and i think i&#39;ve got one other question</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.760" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">for you joe</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">um which is i&#39;m wondering if you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">give us an example</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">of some of the work that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">like what is a complex problem that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">worked on and what would be sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">the wrong approach and then contrast</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">that to the approach that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">took</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">and sort of why is why is applied</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">complex complexity the the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">approach for this</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">so i mean recent example is uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">the coronavirus issue and back in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">january</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">i wrote a paper along with naseem talib</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">and yunir baryam and we said</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">look this thing is something we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">take very seriously we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">apply precautionary measures immediately</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">not because we know</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">it will be bad but because based on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">we do know it could be really bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">so what are the assumptions we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">working with there</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">uh that were counter to some other</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">assumptions well one</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">is that the dynamics are multiplicative</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">meaning one person gets sick they get</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">more than one person sick more than one</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">person we all</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">are probably familiar by now with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">are not idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">that are not as such has some issues as</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">a as a parameter to rely on in any sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">but just as a multiplicative</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">process and two our assumption is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">is very very closely</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">interconnected so we are living in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">small world</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">in the most extreme way there&#39;s very few</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">hops between</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">any two people choose any two random</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">people on earth how many hops does it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">take in terms of interpersonal contact</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">for one person to reach another very few</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">no one knows the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">true answer but i mean we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">like a handful maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">max you know five four very few hops</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">so everyone&#39;s very close in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">topological space</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">and um it is this topology combined with</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">multiplicative dynamics that puts no</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">upper bound on a spread of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">contagious disease like that and so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">pointed to that we said this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">this is exactly a scenario where you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">take precaution and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">you can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">for for disease those things can be you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">vaccine development and therapeutics and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">all those are good things</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">um but they&#39;re fundamentally the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">scale to begin on uh the right scale to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">begin on</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">is to first kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">in a sense and it&#39;s i&#39;m not implying</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">lockdowns but</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">freeze in place in the sense of cut all</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">non-essential travel</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:38.839" style="s2">this is not a permanent thing it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">adaptive decoupling</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">um gain some it&#39;s really like an ooda</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">loop almost if you&#39;re familiar with with</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">that idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">uh orient to the issue um start to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">become more sensitive put resources into</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">sensitizing yourself where is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">where is it not</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">and um you know you might have heard</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">this idea of like a green zone red zone</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">start implementing these spatial</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">strategies where you start clearing</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">zones and then you expand the zones in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">which you&#39;re clearing</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">obviously at least here in the u.s we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t take this strategy</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">at all and that&#39;s why we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">dealing with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">so i&#39;m not going to say that we dealt</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">with this successfully because clearly</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">we&#39;re still dealing with this problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">but i think our approach to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">way we&#39;re thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">um shows that there&#39;s actually a few</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">very call them simple underlying</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">uh details of the system and let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">first pay attention to those</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">and and attack those and and then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">get the other things in let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">vaccines let&#39;s uh let&#39;s do testing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">do contact tracing</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">all of those things should come after um</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">prior to that so another example a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">little different</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">setting is a few years ago i went down</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">did a fellowship with the u.s special</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">operations command</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">and they were having issues with um</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">well frankly understanding themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">they knew that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">were very successful in certain contexts</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">and they were perceived that way as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">in government it&#39;s all about fighting</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">for money so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">all of these different fiefdoms are just</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">fighting for the same dollars</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">and so they were trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">how they make their case for their</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">dollars frankly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">um in making that case articulating</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">their unique value in what they do</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">so interestingly because they had been</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">they were being they were successful in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">some sense and they were being perceived</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">as successful the dollars were flowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">to them already</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">and they found that they were starting</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">to have more problems after the dollar</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">started to flow</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">and so what was happening well it turns</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">out that what was happening was</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">as they were getting uh more capital</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">more monetary resources they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">bureaucratizing</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">and that bureaucratizing was making them</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">more uniform</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">across their their approaches their</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">teams their operations how they operated</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">and the the piece that they were missing</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">was that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">the standardization uh that they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">kind of going through was actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">removing their value and their value was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">maintaining independence among</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">individuals among teams</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">among approaches and operations and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:29.760" style="s2">uh their success was undercutting their</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">values so we did a study</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">with them and and drew that out and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">hopefully convinced them or at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">some of them that um</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">you know fight for your money sure but</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">um you need to maintain independence</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">among these units</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">the the the tendency is for things to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">become bureaucratic and centralized</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">and for that independence to break down</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">um and if you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">the fine-grained complexity that uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">special operations are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">then that&#39;s actually um a hindrance not</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">a help</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s another example of where we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">applied some systems thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">to a problem thanks</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">that really helps grow me up um</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">jacob spence has a question would you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">like to read that out loud jacob</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">sure um i was curious if in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">history of uh coming about to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">as a thing that you study</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">and apply um if this had sort of always</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">piqued your interest and it just grew</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">and developed</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">um or if you had any sort of turning</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">point where you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">all about applying like the latest</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">linear equilibrium models and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">had a seeing the light moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">frame shift you know actually i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">um i&#39;ve benefited from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">my father worked in complex systems he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">actually a pioneer in</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">complex systems engineering and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">truth is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">that the earliest memory i have of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">having an aha moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">was sitting on the toilet and i picked</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">a book that was sitting there sync by</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">stephen strogatz and started reading on</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">and um that&#39;s when it first started</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">clicking to me you know he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">fireflies and and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">emerging patterns of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">synchronization and that that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">complexity started clicking for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">uh truly and i&#39;d say the other um</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">experience i had when i was younger uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">was through music</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">and i think that most musicians will</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">find um</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">complexity pretty natural in that music</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">almost purely relational um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">for instance um when you play a chord</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">say on a piano you&#39;re playing more than</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">one note</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">right and the quality that arises from</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">from a chord is not like individual</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">added together it&#39;s something new that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">none of the notes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">have possessed there&#39;s no quality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">harmony in a single note and um</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">moreover things like major and minor</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">chords can be constructed from</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">sort of a infinite set of of different</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">unique notes but they retain some</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">quality among them because of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">relation between them so i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">as well music uh kind of primed me to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">see that way</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">um and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">let&#39;s see then in um</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">undergrad i was started getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">interested in cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">philosophy of mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">and once again it it became imminently</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">that uh the folks who were bringing</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">clarity to the situation were always</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">invoking uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">relational issues so you have things</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">like um affordances as percepts so</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">affordances are come from jj gibson</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">where he talks about perception as</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">perceiving opportunities for action</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">so opportunities for action for who for</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">the agent well</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">what&#39;s an opportunity for action well</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">depends on for instance the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">your body the anatomy of your body</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">uh like what do you see when you see a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">branch well it&#39;s kind of graspable</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">and i can hang on it um these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">not something that&#39;s in the branch these</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">are not something that&#39;s in the body</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">these are something that&#39;s relational</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">between these things so that was another</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">um that was another kind of set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">experiences that that started to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">reinforce that idea that really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">it&#39;s in the interaction and the relation</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">between all these parts that the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">that i&#39;m interested in exist</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">and i&#39;ve just kind of continued on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">continuous path towards complexity there</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">was never</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">besides that the toilet moment with</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">there was never really a single turning</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">point that i could i could point to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">let&#39;s go to uh matthew stevenson with</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">his question</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">oh i will read it for you um so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">this is going in a bit of a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">direction but wondering does your</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">experience in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">motivate the more localized homesteading</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">way of life you practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">and if so what areas of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">are you trying to mitigate through this</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">in part it certainly motivates it um</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">one of the things and this is related to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">the discussion on on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">covid pandemic because of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">interdependent we are at such large</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">scales now global scales</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">for pretty much everything every good</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">every service everything is touching</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve set ourselves up for for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">set of tail risks and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">i i&#39;m sorry to say that kovid</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">is just a preview um this is not like oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">this once in a million-year thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">happened and nothing like swept no this</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">we are connected we are more connected</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">than ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">um if we don&#39;t learn our lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">this we&#39;ll continue in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">which is probably the case um</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">and so certainly um developing some</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">personal redundancy that is for</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">my family myself to um not depend</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">on what&#39;s produced halfway around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">globe</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">sets us up for when some of these tail</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">risk events happen hey we have some shot</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">you know we anyone can be overcome by</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">events there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">panacea yet um if you have no redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">if you have nothing to fall back on</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">locally</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">then you&#39;re really in a tough spot</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">whereas if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t be purely</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">self-sufficient as an individual of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">course i mean i guess you could but you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">uh wouldn&#39;t have much of a life beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">that self-sufficiency but at</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">very small scales you can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">quite comfortably self-sufficient say</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">scale of the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know of the size of new</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">hampshire where i live i</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">i am certainly convinced that almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">everything that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">live comfortable life could be produced</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">in new hampshire um</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">now new hampshire could have a natural</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">disaster and then we could rely on our</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">neighbors vermont</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">maine massachusetts but that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">scaling up of reliance should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s happening dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">in response to needs rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the norm and now you depend on in</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">a existential way</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s definitely a uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">motivating</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">factor from from from thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">complexity and the need for</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">um independence among some of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">components um</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">for for survival reasons that motivates</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">and you know um things like permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">and regenerative agriculture caught my</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">eye before</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">we made a move like this and things i</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">started reading up on</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s just another way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">interacting with the world and and being</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">that seems to not um be at odds</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">with with the natural um cycle of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">and and the natural tendencies of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">world whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve industrialized things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">and tried our best</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">and failed in most cases to to um</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">build a mechanical vision of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">at scale</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">um i just i see that i see how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">constantly at tension with</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">the way ecosystems work the way all our</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">life support systems work</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">and the way it can undercut them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">just i just have no desire</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">to to participate that if i can avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">to the degree that i can avoid it to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">degree that i can</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">go a different way and and make some</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">incremental tiny move towards something</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">that i that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">feel more right about</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not the only person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">interested in complexity that i know</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">that is also doing a homesteading style</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">thing i know i think i can point my</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">finger at</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">at least two or three others and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to think okay joe</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">norman</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">is thinking and he&#39;s seeing the world in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">a way that&#39;s different from how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">i would like to be able to think in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">ways that you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">and i imagine that it&#39;s still quite a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">rare</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">way of thinking or a rare way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">interpreting the world and it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">valuable to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">um so i&#39;m actually going to point at</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">josh</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">field to ask his question next</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">hey uh my question is just uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">how should oh sorry should complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">systems thinking be taught</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">um and included in school curriculums</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">and what are some</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">core principles and concepts that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">necessary for children to grasp with</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">regards to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">so i if if i were running a course if i</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">were running a school i would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">teach it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">but i wouldn&#39;t project that on any</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">system at scale that people should teach</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">this or should teach that i i would</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">actually let them figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">um that&#39;s that sort of part of my</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">philosophy of life is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">i&#39;ll only push things at a scale that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">uh couldn&#39;t succeed if they were not at</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">that scale right</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s tempting to say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">everyone should learn it but but</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s too important to me to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">independence among</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">those kinds of decisions um so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">so no i would not project that in any</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">global sense that people should learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">um but i i would do it personally</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">um and core concepts so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">the core concepts that really come up</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">over and over are you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">having an understanding of what is meant</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">by reductionism what do we really mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">when we say that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">um someone is applying reductionism to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">some system</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">then once you kind of grasp that you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">see the complement more easily you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">see okay if that&#39;s what this is then</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">then what is the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">one of the examples i really like um for</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">talking about reductionism and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">failure of reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">is if you know this um geometric idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">a mobius strip</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">which is like kind of take a strip of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">paper and almost like you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">put the strip of paper in a loop</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">but you spin it 180 degrees you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">twist it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">you know halfway and connect it back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">and the thing that that produces</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">geometrically sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">just in mathematical abstract space is</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">an object that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">one-sided so the piece of paper we feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">is kind of two-sided there&#39;s this side</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">of the paper there&#39;s that side of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">but when you have a mobius strip you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">actually if you for instance put a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">pencil on it and start</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">drawing on the surface there would be no</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">other side to draw a line on you&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">kind of the both sides of that paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">without ever lifting your pencil off</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">now interestingly let&#39;s say i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">interested in that property so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to now be a reductionist and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try to figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">that property comes from by cutting that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">movie strip up into parts well the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">moment i cut that mobius strip into any</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">parts that are smaller than the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">i now have parts that are two-sided not</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">one-sided</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">so every part of the system every local</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">piece of the system is two-sided</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">but the global piece of the system is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">one-sided so you so you see very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">trying to understand this by pulling it</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">into parts and and studying them</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">is never going to get you there um so so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">this idea of reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">and the failure of reductionism and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">you get then are things called emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">um those are some of the core concepts</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">probably the other sort of major major</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">concept is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">so what&#39;s making the mobius strip</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">one-sided is the organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">of the whole system or object</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">and um but where does that organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">well for a mobius strip it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">the mind of mobius</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">but for many things in the world where</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at properties that arising</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">from the organization of the system</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">there is no external agent who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">constructing the system taking the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">pieces and putting them into the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">the pieces are actually interacting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">putting themselves into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">right places or putting themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">wherever they end up</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">and so this idea of self-organization of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">organization that that that arises</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not uh dictated by by a planner</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">or a constructor</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">or however you want to call it um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">sort of the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">major major theme that that i would hit</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">on if i were trying to teach people</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">about just the core</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">uh concepts of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">joe i&#39;m kind of getting the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">even this description of complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">kind of like trying to take a concept</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">that you have to understand the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">and bringing it into little chunks like</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">with each of these questions you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">well here&#39;s one aspect of it and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">another aspect and if we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">understand each of these different</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">pieces we might be able to sort of grok</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">that whole thing there</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m just that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">correct i mean so so complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">topic complexities</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">itself has many facets it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">hyper-dimensional object and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">like an infinite number of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">kind of travel and look at it and every</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">perspective will kind of highlight</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">different things and hide other things</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">and and that&#39;s exactly right and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">ultimate hole to be grasped frankly i</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think that i&#39;ve grocked the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think anyone has</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">i think that everyone who&#39;s involved is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">kind of looking from</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">a perspective or a set of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re all kind of putting little</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">pieces of that together</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">and over time you kind of get these uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">sort of phase transition aha moments</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">where you&#39;ve seen enough different</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">angles or you go oh i</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">get how those are connected now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">understanding the relations among these</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">different concepts</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s always like it&#39;s like kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">of like spiraling outwards you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">travel around and see the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">again and you&#39;re always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">backing up a little further and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">seeing a little more and getting the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">bigger picture but i don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">an end to that process</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">i mean for me uh studying complexity has</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">been the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">uh humility inducer it&#39;s like the moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">you think that you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">understand things like no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">more subtleties there&#39;s there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s more to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">awesome and i think this totally fits in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">with kevin&#39;s question as well so kevin</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">deland do you want to read out your</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">sure awesome hey joe great i love this</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">um so complexity is biased nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">non-one year has many moving parts etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">but many of our current methods of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">communicating thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">and understanding are limited by their</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">linearity</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">how do you see the role of new</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">computer-based mediums</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">and communicating ideas of complexity to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">the general public</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">some examples might be simulations video</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:05.919" style="s2">interactives explorable explanations etc</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">and some of these can be especially</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.919" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">useful for communicating</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">the concepts you mentioned like</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">immersion properties and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">self-organization um so that and do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">see any examples</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">or have you experienced any examples</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">that you find particularly promising</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">interesting so for one i&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">buy into the assumption that all our</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">ways of communicating are linear</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">i mean i think that we&#39;re involved in</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">highly non-linear</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">interactions all the time every time we</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">speak to one another um</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing i&#39;d say um with</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">respect to technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">and kind of communicating these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">well i&#39;ll put a plug-in for myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">here i&#39;m actually um starting up an</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">online course</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;m going to run the first session this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">fall actually starting next week</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to run it synchronous kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">of like this stoa meeting because i</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">really think</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">you know as we&#39;re doing right now uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">the the mooc kind of pre-packaged video</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">courses they they&#39;re they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">i use them for things and not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">uh hate on them or anything but</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">they lack something really essential and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">that is that as we&#39;re able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">interact and communicate</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">um we are able to surface things</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">and and and kind of get to the point in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">a way that you can&#39;t with a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">one-directional communication like um</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">like like um a post-it video or</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">so um i&#39;m gonna run that course and my</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">plan is to run more of those sessions</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">and more courses some more in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">technical courses as well in the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">so if anyone is interested in that uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">please do check that out</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">um and other than that i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">for all of its ills and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">maybe negative you can point to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">the the advent of social media really</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">this development uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">moving beyond broadcast media into this</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">two-way communication and and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">is kind of a broadcaster and a receiver</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">um i think is really uh something</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">really important for us to to evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">as a species</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">and right now i think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">experiencing a lot of the instabilities</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">inducing um but those</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">instabilities are a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">out of the previous stabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">broadcast media</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">and broadcast media is is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">unnatural i mean when you imagine where</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">do we come from we don&#39;t come from</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">a uh history where there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">large-scale broadcast media there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">um centralize a message and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">force coherence on a mass population</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">that was a very brief moment in history</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">in fact that that was a thing and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s over again and it&#39;s ending we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">transitioning out of it um</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">so i think social media is is a huge um</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">gain in in starting to communicate some</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">of these ideas and other ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">figuring out who we are and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">about what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">um hopefully we can kind of pass through</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">some of the strife that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">experiencing as we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">destabilize and and re-stabilize on</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">hopefully not horrific frankly but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">see um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">and as far as as games and simulations</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">i&#39;m certain that that um</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">they could be helpful for some folks to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">gain intuition around some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">concepts ideas and maybe it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">worth pursuing but</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not uh where i&#39;ve naturally</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">gone towards but i can imagine i could</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">imagine it it could be really cool to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">have some games that really highlight</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">some of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go to dan feldman next</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">getting lots of plus ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">hi um my</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">question is as the world is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">interconnected and interrelated and at</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">least to me obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">complex i i also studied complexity uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">when i was studying electrical</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">engineering um</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">how has the education system and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">dominant meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">kept most of humanity unable to see the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">and then i add in a little addendum here</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">i think that an argument i live for 10</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">years in china so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">i have that&#39;s a little bit of background</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">here i think that an argument could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">made that taoism and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">and their non-dualistic uh mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">together with</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">the chinese pictographs have enabled</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">them to avoid reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">far more easily</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">so i i don&#39;t feel i can speak to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">what exactly the education system has</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">done that&#39;s prevented people from</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">from kind of seeing things in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">way but i do think there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">with respect to sort of eastern</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">philosophies and ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">are much more naturally inclined to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">see kind of the holism</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">and the way in which reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">yield all the answers um</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">once again this is sort of the second</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">question around education system and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">feel i feel fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">incapable of making recommendations or</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">comments on large-scale educational</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">approaches</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">i think i mean for one thing people are</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">unique i think we fail in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t apply enough apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">type models to pretty much anything um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">we we&#39;re sort of we think in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">information download as if there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">of this information inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">teacher&#39;s head and they just need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">transfer to the students</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">when really i mean even even the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">abstract</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">of endeavors like mathematics is</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">inherently an embodied activity</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">and one of the ways that you learn about</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">it get better at it have insights around</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">it is to spend time around people doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">math</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">and and not for them necessarily to tell</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">you here&#39;s what to do here&#39;s how to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">here&#39;s how i think it&#39;s just to spend</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">time around them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">and kind of soak it in and i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">is in part i mean apprenticeship enables</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">adaptation of a mentor to a protege say</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">but it also is really about just that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">very high bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">um communication that that um</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">a lot of subtle sort of embodied details</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">that are very difficult to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">and even very</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">difficult to parse in perception yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">there there&#39;s a transference that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">happens um</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:36.839" style="s2">so yeah i can&#39;t i can&#39;t speak much</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">uh to the the pictographs um and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.839" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">chinese um</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">influences that allow them to see that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">but i definitely have more more than i</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">have an understanding of why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">case i haven&#39;t noticed that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ve also noticed it with uh folks</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">from india</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of uh indians who</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">inherently say oh yeah of course like i</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">get that like that&#39;s that makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">me whereas</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">um people from western culture is not as</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">much or it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">there&#39;s more unlearning that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">happen there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">seems to be a lot of mental models that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">are actually getting in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">that need to be unlearned</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go to joe rivera</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">you guys can hear me yep yep okay cool</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">question comes because um i was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">first exposed to this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">from nasim taleb stuff and through him i</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">found you in a bunch of your work</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">um and it seems to me as someone you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">know knew to all of this relatively</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">that televis had a lot of success in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">last decade and sort of bringing this</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">way of thinking to a lot more people and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">almost you could say to the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">and i was just wondering for the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">unfamiliar with the whole literature</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">around complexity chaos theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">cybernetics like</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">just starting places like besides you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">know the whole ensured</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">intruder series um for non-technical</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">to like actually sink their teeth in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">because like you said</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">reading those books it feel it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">embodied and you start to like see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">things out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">and i was just wondering if you had any</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">other thinkers writers whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">that someone could actually sink their</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">teeth in and embody this further</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll just throw you a handful of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">favorite fingers that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">pop off the top of my head um i love stu</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">kaufman</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">um i i his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">the adjacent possible and think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">evolution as</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">this sort of non-ergotic uh stepping</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">into new possibility space all the time</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">along with many of his other thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">you know auto catalytic sets</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">as sort of the foundation of life so stu</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">kaufman</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">um is a great person to to look into</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">chris alexander who is an architect</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">and who sees that the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">in modern times that we construct</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">buildings</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">that we design and construct buildings</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">fundamentally different than the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">it&#39;s been done historically</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">and it produces things that often feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">alienating or might be perceived as ugly</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t kind of fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">context that they&#39;re in in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">pretty much every building through</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">history did for for a time</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:32.079" style="s2">um so i love chris alexander timeless</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">way of building um</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">is is a book that really um</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">impacted me and i&#39;ve read it a number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">times and every time i read it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">i get something else out of it it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">of those kinds of books</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">um i&#39;m a big fan of robert rosen who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">um even lesser known than these other</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">guys um</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">his book in particular life itself i</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">really um the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">the treatment not only of the thesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">that he develops</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">but the way he um articulates and treats</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">uh reductionism and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">scientific enterprise and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">doing when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">model natural systems with formal</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">and how those interrelate i think is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">really</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">non-technical read</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s a little more it reads a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">more like a pop-sci book but i think the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">the ideas are solid and he&#39;s a solid guy</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s still one of our biggest</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">is it as bad as we thought is it worse</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">than we thought are there long-term</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">we should be saying hey if this was even</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;re this isn&#39;t good if this was even</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">everyone can adopt a homesteading</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">well for one thing i think more people</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">could adopt a homesteading lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">or at least um there&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">the case that there couldn&#39;t be some</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">uh rural revival where young people do</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">move out to the country and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">and make things happen and i would love</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">to see that and i encourage it</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">um but in all environments i mean urban</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">environments are not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">either this is a natural part</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">of of being human is having urban</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">you you know i&#39;ve lived i&#39;ve lived in</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">urban environments i&#39;ve lived in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">cambridge mass you can find</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">farms that are just outside the city you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">can change the way you grocery shop</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">you can uh decide not to to order that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">thing from around the world and look on</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">even any even things that are like etsy</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re like oh it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">small artisanal maker of product x or i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">can order it from amazon</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">order from the small artisanal maker so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s really those like little decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">and i think even going on a larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">knowing that the people here or i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">making an assumption that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">people here are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">in terms of like where to actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">intervene in the system um</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping to pass things over to morgan</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">carter to ask his question</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">cool um so how do you decide how best to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">intervene</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">in a complex system particularly ones</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">that are too complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">to to wrap your head around and how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">you make good decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">and how do you judge the outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">those decisions without</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">resorting to reductionist metrics and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">can give an example here</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">if that helps i was working recently on</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">a project um</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">working within an organization about 600</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">people and it became clear after a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">couple of weeks that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">no one in the organization knew what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">organization was doing there was too</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">things going on so it became quite hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">make good decisions within the context</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">of that project and then to judge them</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">science says anything that can help</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">tackle that sure so um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">i mean if you can&#39;t judge if you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">to a better</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">place than where you were before then</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">you are kind of in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">because you need to at least have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">selection criteria have things gotten</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">better have things gotten worse</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know of any shortcut around</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">that specifically</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">um the non-shortcut around that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">i mean depending it depends what your</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">organization does but there&#39;s some uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">something there&#39;s either an end user or</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">something analogous to like an end user</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">so i mean you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:04.960" style="s2">have as little proxy to that step as</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">possible in terms of judging is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">better is this worse</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">well what does the user say um</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the ground truth in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">sense um</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">but in general um because you can&#39;t wrap</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">your head around</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">everything going on you need to create a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">you need to make a facsimile of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">evolution where you&#39;re creating a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">selective environment of some kind and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">exactly the selection</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">is that end user or some as close to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">that as you can get</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">where it&#39;s judging better worse better</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">worse and you&#39;re not worried so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">about exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">those pieces fit together to produce</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">that better thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">you only care that it&#39;s better um in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">more generally uh with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">intervention</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">you you need to consider well what kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">of a system am i working with what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">the intervention i&#39;m proposing</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">and if something went wrong with this</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">intervention what would be the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">harm</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">that would that i can expect um and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">other way think about it sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">puts the upper bound on that scope of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">harm</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">what what stops the harm from spreading</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">if it can spread</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">um and then you need to be okay with</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">uh intervening where failure is</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">tolerable</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">and where the scope of failure is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">tolerable and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">there&#39;s really there&#39;s really no</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">shortcut to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the long trudge of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.839" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">so so i mean intervening</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">is always some kind of an uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">injection</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s basically what i found i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">hoping there was some shortcut</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">but i guess not it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">rather than hoping there&#39;s a shortcut</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">making decisions understanding there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">not and uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">thinking in terms of of how do i</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">like i said how do i select and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">fail and which kind of failures</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">can i tolerate and which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">failures can i not</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">i think for me i&#39;m almost thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">run like looking at it as different</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">experiments that one might run</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">like if i poke the system in this way</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">what happens am i allowed to poke it</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">this way am i worried if i poke it this</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">what sort of comes up and what does this</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">tell me about the thing that i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">in terms of its emergent behaviors right</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">i mean yeah with the complex system</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">no no way to learn about it without</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">perturbing it without without poking it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">and and seeing what happens um so</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">that that&#39;s why i say you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">to think about the failure mode and like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">if i poked it here and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">something starts spreading from there</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">is that bad does that hurt things can i</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">tolerate it if it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">keeps spreading is there anything to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">stop it spreading if it if it does</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">and and you know the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">i&#39;ll say and this is you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">really from the scene</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">uh talib is um</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">if you&#39;re you can choose to not</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">intervene that&#39;s a choice you can make</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">and often that&#39;s actually a good choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">let things</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">uh living systems heal</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">and you have to let them heal and if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:28.960" style="s2">keep poking a wound</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t heal um now</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.960" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">if you&#39;re bleeding out okay you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">intervene</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">close up the wound right so when things</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">get really extreme</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">sort of existentially extreme where you</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:44.079" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">the system might perish then intervene</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.079" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:49.760" style="s2">go for it you know put all your chips in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">but other than that you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.760" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">step back and let things</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">uh resolve of their own accord and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">think we don&#39;t do nearly enough of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously not a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">everything obviously</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">but we air very much on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:05.119" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">we are constantly trying to intervene to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.119" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">make the thing right</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">and that is actually a guarantee that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">the system will never</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">sort of settle down into some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">stable dynamic equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">it will continue to destabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">system and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">chasing uh the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">you know as you destabilize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">getting these excursions away from some</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">stable point</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to keep chasing the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">around if you&#39;re intervening too much</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">too often</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">and not letting the forces resolve</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">so i think we have time for one more</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">i think i&#39;d like to go to ann jen you</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">asked a question</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">significantly earlier i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">you&#39;d like to to read that question out</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">i think that would be a good one to end</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">hey joe um hey i i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve read a couple of these books i go</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">to these lectures and i get pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">excited</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">um and i just am terrible at applying it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">my life like i still make the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">stupid decisions the way i understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.799" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">news the way i</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">pick things to buy the way i plan my day</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">my week blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">i&#39;m curious how it went from something</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">that you were intellectually fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">to actually like embodying and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">integrating it into your life and kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">mental habits if there was like events</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">or things</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">that were inflection points that would</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">be cool if you shared</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">oh i i don&#39;t think that there has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.599" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">any kind of inflection point that i can</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">everything has been a small step it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">been a series of small small steps</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">right now you know i&#39;m saying we&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">here homesteading</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">you know what homesteading looked like</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">yesterday is different than what it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">looks like tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">and usually that&#39;s in the right</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">direction sometimes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">uh we had to fire on our property</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">earlier this year</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">and that set us back quite a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">we&#39;re still rebuilding from that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">getting back to where we were in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">of ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">other things can progress alongside it</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">in parallel and that&#39;s that&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">we have but</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">with respect to having some of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">outbuildings that were serving some</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">functions for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:26.079" style="s2">that&#39;s uh we&#39;re set back quite a ways um</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">and i guess you know taking the leap of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.079" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">moving to essentially the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">i guess could be almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">inflection point but it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">that way because</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">up until like we started we said hey we</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">learn how to produce our own food we</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">neither myself nor my wife</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">had ever done that in our lives uh we</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.799" style="s2">the hell we were doing um so we started</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">a little container garden</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.799" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">in in the back of the little house we</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">were renting</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">and you know i i remember so so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:57.760" style="s2">maybe an inflection point</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">emotionally at least i don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.760" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">really is but um</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">we plant we put some soil and like egg</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">cartons and we planted some little</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:06.640" style="s2">tomato seeds</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">and that was the first thing we planted</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.640" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">and we had them like sit in the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">on top of the refrigerator</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">and i remember when those first sprouts</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">went and we were like</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">holy you know the most almost in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">sense it&#39;s like the most mundane thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">on earth like this happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">everywhere this is nothing uh remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">but in other sense obviously the the um</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">genesis of a living pattern out of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">little seed is</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:35.200" style="s2">quite remarkable and for me emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2">i think for my wife as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.200" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2">it was just kind of a hey</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">this is almost like nothing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">amazingly gratifying to even see this</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of doing itself i mean we</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">gave it the conditions but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">going itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">and so okay yeah we brought those</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">seedlings up and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">planted some other ones and started a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:56.319" style="s2">container garden and started eating from</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.319" end="00:57:59.280" style="s2">all of a sudden we&#39;re eating from from</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">our little container garden and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.280" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">starting to reinforce wow we can really</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">do this um</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">so i think that combined with at that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">same time we also</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">enrolled in our first csa which if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that is it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">stands for community supported</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">agriculture and it means that basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">you buy</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">like a subscription to a farm and every</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">week or whatever their timing is</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">you get like a box of stuff from them i</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">mean different farms running different</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">details but</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">the essential idea is you get some share</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">of vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">and you know if they have a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:31.119" style="s2">season then your share might suck and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s community supported</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">agriculture right because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.240" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">getting a guarantee in any sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">you&#39;re really going to get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">but my experience is most the time you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">get amazing vegetables so at that same</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">time we also did that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">and we started visiting the farms that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">we&#39;re getting uh the csa from</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">and um that was also</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">really like a moment where we were like</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:53.280" style="s2">all right this is like we&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.839" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing we stopped eating</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">random junk from the store um</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:00.400" style="s2">so there was there&#39;s some moments that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">were like really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.400" end="00:59:03.520" style="s2">felt like aha moments but i but when i</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">look at the actual history and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.520" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">progression of things i mean everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">has been a very small step</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">thanks joe so i&#39;m going to leave that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">our last question for today</p>
