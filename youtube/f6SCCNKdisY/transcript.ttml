<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">lots of conversations that are 2-way on</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">video chat or more than two way in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">groups and thriving from that like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">people who are who are choosing to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">part of those conversations choosing to</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">fall apart even a little bit owning it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.850" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">making amends figuring out how to move</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:20.220" style="s2">forward together and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">individual right like where did I go</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.220" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">wrong how do I apologize for it how do i</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">how do I fix it and that&#39;s to me the big</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">difference like this this um capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">versus communism debate that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t get rid of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:39.330" style="s2">this communism is the alternative and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.330" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">capitalism is forced competition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">not it&#39;s like you compete or you starve</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">and communism is forced cooperation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">do what&#39;s better for the group or he</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">starve or you could you know get</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">imprisoned and so it&#39;s not competition</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.769" style="s2">versus cooperation it&#39;s forced</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:04.739" style="s2">competition versus forced cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.769" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">and I think both of those things when</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.739" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">done voluntarily have a much better</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.610" style="s2">impact if you can voluntarily choose</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">wearing your life you&#39;re competing so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.610" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting the biggest benefit</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">as an individual right like never we</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">outline sports any competition and if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">helps you thrive we should have it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:26.040" style="s2">for some people who don&#39;t thrive in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:27.380" style="s2">competition to have to compete is unkind</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.040" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">and violent</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.380" end="00:03:31.890" style="s2">similarly for scene people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:32.970" style="s2">want to be in cooperation who don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.890" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">to do what&#39;s in it for the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.970" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">who don&#39;t want to work unless someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">working more right who don&#39;t want to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">produce the most be the most that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:49.109" style="s2">want to be because they see it as like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">it&#39;s forced they don&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.109" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s forced whereas when you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">tap into the voluntary nature of both of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">those things and you can choose as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">individual how much competitions in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">life and how much cooperation and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">the benefits of cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">competition and like truly see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">benefits and get the benefits back then</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">you&#39;re I believe you&#39;ll choose</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:16.070" style="s2">cooperation more often but not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">will competition is still a important</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.070" end="00:04:22.229" style="s2">aspect of our society the people thrive</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">under but forced competition not okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">forced cooperation equally if not more</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:30.600" style="s2">Island in history and so having</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.790" style="s2">voluntary cooperation where everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.600" end="00:04:34.169" style="s2">is an attractor if it can be done better</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.790" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">with competition it&#39;s going to be done</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.169" end="00:04:37.590" style="s2">better with competition and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">done better with cooperation it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.590" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">to be done better with cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:41.760" style="s2">in that in that realm</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">I believe cooperation of competes</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.760" end="00:04:46.949" style="s2">competition a cooperative a ball and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">Terry cooperative that you can come and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.949" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">get your needs met and he&#39;ll be heard</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.680" style="s2">and help improve it out competes</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:55.169" style="s2">competition that is like we&#39;re in it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">ourselves the biggest firm wins the you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.169" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">know and then you get richer and richer</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">and richer because this has one winner</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">and this has everyone winning but</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">outline this hurts this and forcing this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:14.610" style="s2">hurts this so it&#39;s the voluntary piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">that we are tapping into and that came</p>
