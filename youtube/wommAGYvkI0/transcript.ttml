<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">when I was a full-time researcher at SFI</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:56.940" style="s2">rather often if I just had a conundrum I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:00:59.100" style="s2">would go talk to Eric and it was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.940" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">no matter what the area was Eric could</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">provide some interesting insight Eric&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">topics eric has also spent a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">considerable amount of time over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">years in China and has recently</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">refreshed his knowledge of China with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.550" style="s2">trip over there and he&#39;s got some</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">interesting perspectives on that whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.550" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">China thing so Eric what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">China what do you think about it well</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s been there will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.260" style="s2">that the the pace of change is striking</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">from people who were born there to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.260" end="00:02:05.370" style="s2">outsiders and that certainly is right</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s interesting is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.370" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">changed and what hasn&#39;t changed of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">course I mean China&#39;s not one thing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">country of 1.6 billion people is many</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">things to many in the business sector</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">you can see the concentration of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">and the confidence that it brings you</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">can see that China wants to be back in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:25.019" style="s2">what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.629" style="s2">considers its natural place as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.019" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">the central front country in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.629" end="00:02:31.859" style="s2">and everything they&#39;re doing is aware of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">the wish to get back there but there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.859" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">certain things from the old days that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">have not changed my contacts are mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:41.970" style="s2">academics and there&#39;s a cheerfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:45.239" style="s2">a sincerity and a sense of goodwill in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.970" end="00:02:47.069" style="s2">trying to address deep questions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.239" end="00:02:49.349" style="s2">just a joy and community and a joy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.069" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">collaboration that&#39;s the same as it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.349" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">always was and a friendliness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">cheerfulness and welcoming people there</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s been a good reconnection</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.319" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">after a while away the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:01.319" style="s2">Chinese system is something I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">interested in it&#39;s not really exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.319" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">like anything we&#39;ve ever seen before do</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">you have any insights into the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">what we might call the Chinese social</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:12.510" style="s2">well it&#39;s intriguing right the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">idea of good governance since time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">memorial has been benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">dictatorship and that shapes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">what they think can work on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:23.310" style="s2">what they think doesn&#39;t need to be tried</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">they see the innovations in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.310" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">manipulation of opinion that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">happening worldwide and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">don&#39;t trust civil society as a machine</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">to control that but they think that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:37.379" style="s2">can be centrally controlled and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.209" style="s2">whole engineering project is an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.379" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">to make that work it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.209" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">look at the history of China even though</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">obviously it has a very deep history in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">time across a geographic space it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">a classic case of punctuated equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">where you know highly centralized</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">command and control systems work until</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:55.919" style="s2">they don&#39;t and when they break down</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">they&#39;ve often broken down very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.919" end="00:03:59.729" style="s2">you know this would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:01.379" style="s2">experiment to see if with modern tools</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.729" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">they can make centralized control</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.379" end="00:04:05.609" style="s2">actually being at least metastable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:06.989" style="s2">this is the thing to ask the experts who</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.609" end="00:04:09.269" style="s2">really spend a lot of time there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">know the society and the people in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.269" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">well because I think they will say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">there are combinations of centralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">control and an attempt at innovation</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:21.599" style="s2">that have always been believed in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:23.099" style="s2">past to be impossible and the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.599" end="00:04:25.259" style="s2">is were they really impossible or was</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.099" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">that context dependent and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.259" end="00:04:30.090" style="s2">anybody knows yeah that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">question right and it is a competing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.090" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">model there&#39;s no doubt about it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:36.419" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously hypotheses that china</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">is still benefitting very substantially</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.419" end="00:04:38.890" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:41.410" style="s2">syndrome where they don&#39;t have to invent</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.890" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">nearly as much as say the West did so</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.410" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">they can rise rapidly basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">absorbing the technology and expertise</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">of the West and they&#39;ve done it better</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:50.380" style="s2">and faster than anybody I guess even</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">better than the Japanese but in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.380" end="00:04:54.100" style="s2">areas they are really at or near the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">state-of-the-art like an AI have you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.100" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">gotten any exposure to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:02.140" style="s2">at AI in China no I&#39;m a viewer of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">information like most people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.140" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">specialists in the area the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">thing about AI is whether it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:11.320" style="s2">a classic example of Philip Anderson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:13.240" style="s2">more is different so we understand for</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.320" end="00:05:14.980" style="s2">instance from deep learning that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:16.750" style="s2">ideas that are now dominating the field</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">were not created in recent time there</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.750" end="00:05:20.980" style="s2">Carnegie Mellon computer science</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:22.830" style="s2">department from the 1970s and 80s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.980" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">just that those ideas were not viable</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.830" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">for the scale of computing in data</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">particularly training set data and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:32.590" style="s2">ability to use it had reached the modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:34.990" style="s2">level and China is going to be the</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:40.540" style="s2">data in the decades going forward the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.410" end="00:05:43.060" style="s2">question is whether there will be new</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.200" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">immensely interesting I suspect at least</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.810" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">to produce lots more data than say the</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">have five times as many people you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.290" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">what I like on this though I think back</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.940" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">playing I really loved Lee&#39;s comment at</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:28.630" style="s2">the end of it where he was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:31.480" style="s2">of course those had been the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.630" end="00:06:33.490" style="s2">difficult games he had had to play but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.480" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">that he had never enjoyed playing go</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.490" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">more than in those games because before</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">he was the best in the world in a style</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:44.650" style="s2">of play that was essentially established</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.780" style="s2">and playing the machine it was opening</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.650" end="00:06:48.490" style="s2">peds of play that no human would have</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:50.380" style="s2">opened against him and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.490" end="00:06:53.259" style="s2">is giving him an insight into the game</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.300" end="00:07:05.650" style="s2">human-computer interactions that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.699" end="00:07:08.259" style="s2">all of these big branching structures</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.650" end="00:07:11.410" style="s2">and the question is when will</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.259" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">computational solutions open PES of play</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.410" end="00:07:15.910" style="s2">that human conventions were not</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.910" end="00:07:20.110" style="s2">transition to our first scientific topic</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.520" end="00:07:22.389" style="s2">because that would obviously be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.110" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">here and that&#39;s origins of life you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.389" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">the transition from the abiotic world to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:28.930" style="s2">the biotic world how did you happen to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.250" style="s2">get interested in this field once you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.930" end="00:07:32.169" style="s2">provide a little framing for our</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.250" end="00:07:33.669" style="s2">audience about what are the questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.169" end="00:07:36.819" style="s2">about the origins of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.669" end="00:07:40.030" style="s2">yeah very good I of course came out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.819" end="00:07:41.560" style="s2">high energy physics and in a period</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.030" end="00:07:44.139" style="s2">after I had left that field and was</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.560" end="00:07:45.669" style="s2">looking for something to do I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.139" end="00:07:48.039" style="s2">looking at phase transitions which was</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.669" end="00:07:51.460" style="s2">sort of the big idea of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.039" end="00:07:53.860" style="s2">in modern physics in some ways more</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">transmissible across the sciences even</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.860" end="00:07:58.650" style="s2">than relativity or quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:01.479" style="s2">which were domain discoveries and I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.650" end="00:08:02.889" style="s2">looking at dynamical phase transitions</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.479" end="00:08:04.630" style="s2">and the sense in which sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.889" end="00:08:06.310" style="s2">tautologically their engines and thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.630" end="00:08:09.880" style="s2">well this seems like a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.310" end="00:08:11.650" style="s2">understand how biology works but biology</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.880" end="00:08:13.659" style="s2">was not studied from that perspective so</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.650" end="00:08:15.460" style="s2">it was really hard to get domain</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.659" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">information to get up to speed and solve</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.460" end="00:08:19.990" style="s2">problems and when I came to the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.250" end="00:08:22.270" style="s2">Institute and met Harold Laura wits</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.990" end="00:08:24.759" style="s2">I met kind of my perfect complement</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.270" end="00:08:27.310" style="s2">because he had been working in topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.759" end="00:08:29.620" style="s2">and biophysics and physiology for 40</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.310" end="00:08:32.050" style="s2">years at the time and said I have all</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.620" end="00:08:34.329" style="s2">these signatures of the biosphere that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.050" end="00:08:36.070" style="s2">looked to law like to have been accident</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.329" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know what kind of laws</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.070" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">should be used to explain them and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:44.620" style="s2">Harold had done was cut to the very</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:46.600" style="s2">simple core of biology where there were</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.620" end="00:08:48.579" style="s2">few enough boundary conditions and few</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.600" end="00:08:50.290" style="s2">enough components that one could think</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.579" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">about trying to bring laws of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.290" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">self-organization to bear on them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:56.620" style="s2">that was the beginning of a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:58.329" style="s2">20-year collaboration that has continued</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.620" end="00:09:00.760" style="s2">to be a foundation of my work to today</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.329" end="00:09:03.339" style="s2">yep I&#39;ve chatted with Harold quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.760" end="00:09:04.900" style="s2">about origin of life enough for my</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.339" end="00:09:06.459" style="s2">simple mind at least they get its head</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.900" end="00:09:08.230" style="s2">around a little bit you know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.459" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">he always told me about he had this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.230" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">amazing picture on his walls he was what</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.959" style="s2">I would describe as a metabolism first</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">person could you tell us what that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.959" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">yeah I can tell you what it means</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:20.350" style="s2">without endorsing it in the classical</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">sense because in some sense by now these</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.350" end="00:09:25.180" style="s2">things are tropes they&#39;re oversimplified</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">positions and in the oversimplified form</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.180" end="00:09:29.500" style="s2">all of them are somewhat absurd but</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:31.480" style="s2">metabolism first was in a sense a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.500" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">response to a different absurd position</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.480" end="00:09:38.529" style="s2">which you could call control first so</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">starting I guess in the 1950s Francis</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.529" end="00:09:42.190" style="s2">Crick recognized that a lot of control</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:45.459" style="s2">flow and modern biology is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.190" end="00:09:47.410" style="s2">top-down you have the phenotype the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.459" end="00:09:49.779" style="s2">kind of organism that lives or dies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.410" end="00:09:52.390" style="s2">that life or death selection preserves</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.779" end="00:09:54.190" style="s2">what genes are in the population then</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.390" end="00:09:56.260" style="s2">through a very complicated control</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.190" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">machinery the genes are expressed in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.260" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">proteins and RNAs and other components</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">which then make up the organism which</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:06.100" style="s2">will have a phenotype in the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:08.680" style="s2">generation so one approach to origin of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.100" end="00:10:11.260" style="s2">life was just to adopt Crick&#39;s central</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.680" end="00:10:13.630" style="s2">dogma for control flow the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.260" end="00:10:16.990" style="s2">control flows from DNA to RNA to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.630" end="00:10:19.779" style="s2">proteins and try to map that all the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.990" end="00:10:21.339" style="s2">back to the beginning of life and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.779" end="00:10:23.110" style="s2">need to do that then you have to say who</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.339" end="00:10:24.760" style="s2">are the genes what&#39;s the phenotype and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.110" end="00:10:27.160" style="s2">what are the Darwinian individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.760" end="00:10:29.199" style="s2">can be selected and there is an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.160" end="00:10:31.899" style="s2">to put all of this heavy burden on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.199" end="00:10:33.790" style="s2">narrow shoulders of RNA molecules making</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:36.279" style="s2">them the individuals that are both</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.790" end="00:10:38.589" style="s2">genotype and phenotype and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.279" end="00:10:40.630" style="s2">chemically that&#39;s very hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.589" end="00:10:42.490" style="s2">because RNA is complicated and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.630" end="00:10:44.920" style="s2">clear what kind of a system it should</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.490" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">first appear in but also when you look</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.920" end="00:10:49.480" style="s2">at the small molecule chemistry of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a very low like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.480" end="00:10:53.829" style="s2">economical and it&#39;s economical in ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:56.620" style="s2">that would not be explained just by an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.829" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">arbitrary control flow from RNA downward</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.620" end="00:11:01.810" style="s2">so what the metabolism first point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:04.930" style="s2">view was an attempt to do was to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.810" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">that a lot of those laws of deep small</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.930" end="00:11:09.089" style="s2">molecule biochemistry were actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:12.220" style="s2">inherited from regularities in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.089" end="00:11:13.209" style="s2">geochemistry the were there in place</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.220" end="00:11:15.579" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.209" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">biosphere formed and the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.579" end="00:11:20.050" style="s2">basically inherited those informed</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.800" end="00:11:22.600" style="s2">itself around them so I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.050" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">modern version of metabolism first is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.600" end="00:11:28.029" style="s2">idea that life is not one thing and its</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">emergence was not one event but rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.029" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of a hierarchy and a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:35.499" style="s2">of events and in the event before you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:37.899" style="s2">have something recognizable as fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.499" end="00:11:40.149" style="s2">integrated life you have increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.899" end="00:11:42.339" style="s2">organized states of geochemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.149" end="00:11:44.860" style="s2">they&#39;re organized around peds of least</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.339" end="00:11:47.439" style="s2">resistance what we want in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.860" end="00:11:49.569" style="s2">the origin of life is how those pads of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.439" end="00:11:52.899" style="s2">least resistance sort of set a template</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.569" end="00:11:54.819" style="s2">for biochemistry and then that template</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.899" end="00:11:57.339" style="s2">was strong enough and simple enough that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.819" end="00:12:00.069" style="s2">it allowed control structures like genes</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.329" end="00:12:14.139" style="s2">biology the fourth geosphere so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.980" end="00:12:16.029" style="s2">the elegance of heralds insight on how</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.139" end="00:12:18.009" style="s2">to break these problems down he was</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.009" end="00:12:21.879" style="s2">in the use of the term geo spheres and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.439" end="00:12:24.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of an antique usage</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.879" end="00:12:26.649" style="s2">well a word geosphere is used today if</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.279" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">it&#39;s used at all it&#39;s not usually used</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.649" end="00:12:30.670" style="s2">in their nuts key sense but when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:33.759" style="s2">nuts key first brought the term into</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.670" end="00:12:36.129" style="s2">usage he was interested in trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.759" end="00:12:38.949" style="s2">some traction over the great complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.129" end="00:12:41.709" style="s2">of geology and he said look if you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.949" end="00:12:43.779" style="s2">a planet you can&#39;t ask what one molecule</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.709" end="00:12:45.939" style="s2">does because one molecule goes all</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.779" end="00:12:47.139" style="s2">around or one atom goes all around and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.939" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">there are fluxes and currents and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.139" end="00:12:51.009" style="s2">exchanges so how are you going to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:52.839" style="s2">sense of this big complicated system the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.009" end="00:12:54.999" style="s2">way you start is to realize that at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.839" end="00:12:56.799" style="s2">very least you have three big central</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.999" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">systems you have the solid core of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.799" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">planet if it&#39;s an earth-like planet you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:03.759" style="s2">have a distinct subsystem which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:06.339" style="s2">liquid ocean and then for most planets</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.759" end="00:13:09.009" style="s2">you have an atmosphere and while each of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.339" end="00:13:10.509" style="s2">these is complicated in itself there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.009" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">certain things that tie them all</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.509" end="00:13:15.730" style="s2">together the solid part of the planet is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:18.999" style="s2">solid state it&#39;s chemistry and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.730" end="00:13:21.429" style="s2">physics are those of solid materials the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.999" end="00:13:22.840" style="s2">ocean is liquid state it&#39;s chemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.429" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">the chemistry of what can happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.840" end="00:13:27.130" style="s2">water which is permissive in some things</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">and restrictive in others and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.130" end="00:13:31.230" style="s2">atmosphere is gas phase and directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:34.840" style="s2">coupled to the stellar irradiance and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.230" end="00:13:37.000" style="s2">the chemistry and the state of matter is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.840" end="00:13:40.300" style="s2">different in the atmosphere than it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.000" end="00:13:42.580" style="s2">in the ocean or the solid so Vernadsky</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.300" end="00:13:45.880" style="s2">referred to these as the atmosphere the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.580" end="00:13:48.010" style="s2">hydrosphere and the lithosphere nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.880" end="00:13:50.230" style="s2">of course lithosphere is the top of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.010" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">rocky part of the solid part of planet</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.230" end="00:13:54.340" style="s2">so the usage has changed in that way but</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:13:56.170" style="s2">Harold&#39;s insight was to say that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.340" end="00:13:58.390" style="s2">should view the biosphere the same way</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.170" end="00:14:00.610" style="s2">we view any of the other geo spheres</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.390" end="00:14:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a new state of matter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.610" end="00:14:06.430" style="s2">dynamically defined the rules in it are</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.520" end="00:14:08.680" style="s2">different and distinctive from those of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.430" end="00:14:12.340" style="s2">the atmosphere or the hydrosphere or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.680" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">lithosphere and it is more tied together</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.340" end="00:14:19.900" style="s2">by the integration of its processes then</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">the exchanges that it makes with any of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.900" end="00:14:24.760" style="s2">the other components of the planet so</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">how does the fourth geosphere emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.760" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">what is the mixture between the water</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:31.570" style="s2">and the land and the air and as inputs</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.620" end="00:14:33.070" style="s2">into this fourth gsv I know in talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.570" end="00:14:36.010" style="s2">to Harold he wouldn&#39;t even rule out that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.070" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">maybe life originated deep in a mile</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.010" end="00:14:40.390" style="s2">below the Earth&#39;s surface in the rock</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:42.340" style="s2">yeah the subsurface water alteration</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.390" end="00:14:44.650" style="s2">zones are a very very good place to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.340" end="00:14:46.930" style="s2">planetary chemistry and in fact since</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.650" end="00:14:49.510" style="s2">life is driven by electron transfer</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.930" end="00:14:51.280" style="s2">under sort of voltage differences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.510" end="00:14:53.710" style="s2">very difficult to find any other place</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.280" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">within the planet where you have so many</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.710" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">conditions that are good for providing</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:15:00.190" style="s2">those electron transfer potentials and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:02.140" style="s2">also the catalytic environments to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.190" end="00:15:04.780" style="s2">use of them so I think that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.140" end="00:15:06.730" style="s2">still very much in play there&#39;s a quote</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.780" end="00:15:08.350" style="s2">and I can&#39;t remember the source I should</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.730" end="00:15:10.570" style="s2">he&#39;s a member of the astrobiology</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.350" end="00:15:12.610" style="s2">community but it&#39;s pithy and elegant the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.570" end="00:15:14.440" style="s2">quote was that the origin of life is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.610" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">something that happens on a planet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.440" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">something that happens to a planet and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">that was really Harold&#39;s insight that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">the origin of life should be understood</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:24.700" style="s2">through the emergence of a biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s contained</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.700" end="00:15:29.770" style="s2">within individuals it&#39;s rather a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">transition of systems which means that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">it&#39;s multi-component it&#39;s robust and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:34.490" style="s2">changes the dynamics of everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.490" end="00:15:42.500" style="s2">so you can say that a biosphere came out</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:44.930" style="s2">of chemical organization probably from</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.500" end="00:15:47.180" style="s2">rock water interfaces in the chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">that they do the disequilibrium of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.180" end="00:15:54.110" style="s2">atmosphere against the deep bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:56.270" style="s2">earth but as it formed it became its own</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.110" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">system with its own sort of robust</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.270" end="00:16:00.830" style="s2">central tendencies and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.180" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">what he means by the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.830" end="00:16:05.510" style="s2">fourth geosphere from a planet that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.149" style="s2">formerly had had only three okay how</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.510" end="00:16:09.950" style="s2">about your thoughts on how that happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.149" end="00:16:12.890" style="s2">more to the specific but we have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.950" end="00:16:15.290" style="s2">black smoker theories we have the deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.890" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">rock theories what are your insights</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.290" end="00:16:19.670" style="s2">into sort of where and how it might have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:22.190" style="s2">happened yeah my first insight is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.670" end="00:16:24.200" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t try to spin scenarios at</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.190" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2">this point when most people work on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.200" end="00:16:27.830" style="s2">origin of life or have worked on it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:29.750" style="s2">traditionally they&#39;ll have really an</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.830" end="00:16:31.790" style="s2">insight about one process that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.750" end="00:16:33.560" style="s2">in one domain of chemistry at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.790" end="00:16:35.390" style="s2">particular stage and that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.560" end="00:16:37.010" style="s2">where they have a really good idea but</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.390" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">they say well how do i ground this idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.010" end="00:16:41.209" style="s2">how do I know if it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:42.770" style="s2">I should try to connect it to the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.209" end="00:16:45.110" style="s2">that happened before and the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.770" end="00:16:46.970" style="s2">happened after and argue that the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.110" end="00:16:48.980" style="s2">that happened before plausibly set up</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.970" end="00:16:51.170" style="s2">the case I want to make and that its</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.980" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">outcome plausibly set up the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.170" end="00:16:54.649" style="s2">should have had them later problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.329" style="s2">they don&#39;t have good ideas about what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.649" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">happened before and what happened later</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.329" end="00:17:02.029" style="s2">and so they spin these long stories that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:03.950" style="s2">are mostly meaningless and a meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.029" end="00:17:05.390" style="s2">story doesn&#39;t actually improve the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.950" end="00:17:07.880" style="s2">strength of the one place where they do</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.390" end="00:17:09.890" style="s2">have deep insight so I think for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.880" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">origin of life we have to start a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.890" end="00:17:15.050" style="s2">project that we&#39;ve not known how to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:17.300" style="s2">before which is how do we reason about</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.050" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">the good sense of a claim that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.300" end="00:17:23.059" style="s2">incomplete when that claim is going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:24.709" style="s2">stay very incomplete for a long time so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">this is a new problem in science in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.709" end="00:17:28.620" style="s2">processes that are very very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:31.260" style="s2">and have a long history</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.620" end="00:17:33.690" style="s2">all that said I do think there are some</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.260" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">general things that we can recognize a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.690" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">planet like the earth is a battery all</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.370" style="s2">of the materials from which it formed</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.700" end="00:17:43.170" style="s2">the iron and the hydrogen of the early</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.370" end="00:17:45.990" style="s2">stellar atmosphere those are very</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.170" end="00:17:48.330" style="s2">electron donating materials but once you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.990" end="00:17:52.470" style="s2">separate into an atmosphere an ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.330" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">a rocky bulk the war tends to boil off</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.470" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">the top of the atmosphere and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:59.010" style="s2">quite the right way to say it the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:01.230" style="s2">way to say it is that the ultraviolet</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.010" end="00:18:02.910" style="s2">and the x-ray from the Sun split the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.230" end="00:18:05.970" style="s2">water and the hydrogen escapes leaving</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.910" end="00:18:08.250" style="s2">oxygen behind that drives the atmosphere</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.250" end="00:18:13.170" style="s2">the deep bulk and you start to get an</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.380" end="00:18:15.720" style="s2">electron transfer out of the bulk into</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.170" end="00:18:17.550" style="s2">the atmosphere from which the electrons</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.720" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">are then transported off the top as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.550" end="00:18:22.950" style="s2">lose our ocean to stellar breakdown so</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a net electron flow in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.950" end="00:18:27.420" style="s2">battery out of the deep bulk into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:29.160" style="s2">atmosphere and then out into space if</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.420" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">you look at where that electron flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.160" end="00:18:34.140" style="s2">occurs it dominantly occurs at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">spreading centers that are underneath</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.140" end="00:18:38.940" style="s2">the ocean basins at this time this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:41.130" style="s2">where new crust is being formed from</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.940" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">rock that came out of the bulk and was</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.130" end="00:18:46.260" style="s2">not recently in contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">oxidizing atmosphere so I still think if</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.260" end="00:18:51.179" style="s2">you want to look for the organization of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:52.920" style="s2">organic chemistry the places where new</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.179" end="00:18:54.780" style="s2">crust is being formed or the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.920" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">candidates to look for that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.780" end="00:18:59.370" style="s2">controlled chemistry it&#39;s a mild</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:02.100" style="s2">chemistry it&#39;s not the violent chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.370" end="00:19:05.100" style="s2">of ultraviolet or radiation and in being</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.100" end="00:19:07.980" style="s2">mild and relatively low energy it looks</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.100" end="00:19:10.440" style="s2">much closer to biochemistry than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.980" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">chemistry you would do with UV light the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.440" end="00:19:13.350" style="s2">important thing about Low Energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">chemistry is that if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.350" end="00:19:18.270" style="s2">catalysts nothing happens at all so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.460" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for an origin of life of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.270" end="00:19:22.950" style="s2">rock water interfaces where new crust is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.460" end="00:19:24.330" style="s2">formed we really need to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.950" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">catalytic environment to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.330" end="00:19:31.140" style="s2">predict anything at all now if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:33.540" style="s2">mind that as a general context then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.140" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">could say are there organizing centers</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.540" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">in biology that look like the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:39.929" style="s2">for everything if there were not we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:42.149" style="s2">have no story to tell but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.929" end="00:19:44.549" style="s2">turns out that there are everything in</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.149" end="00:19:47.820" style="s2">biochemistry that&#39;s formed comes through</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.549" end="00:19:49.590" style="s2">a small system of only eleven organic</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.820" end="00:19:51.450" style="s2">acids the biggest of them only has six</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.590" end="00:19:54.029" style="s2">carbon atoms and this is called the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.450" end="00:19:56.700" style="s2">citric acid cycle on Earth today it</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.029" end="00:19:58.470" style="s2">exists as a carbon fixation cycle but</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.700" end="00:20:00.539" style="s2">even in the organisms don&#39;t use it to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.470" end="00:20:03.090" style="s2">fix carbon it still is the starting</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.539" end="00:20:05.249" style="s2">point to synthesize everything so if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.090" end="00:20:07.169" style="s2">were looking for a foundation for all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.249" end="00:20:09.149" style="s2">biochemistry I think there&#39;s no better</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.169" end="00:20:10.769" style="s2">evidence of a place to look than the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.149" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">evidence in modern biology for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.769" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">citric acid cycle and it&#39;s really funny</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:17.759" style="s2">if you want to ask is there one molecule</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:19.830" style="s2">in all of this big planet is there one</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.759" end="00:20:21.659" style="s2">molecule that is the center of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.830" end="00:20:24.899" style="s2">metabolism and the center of carbon</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.659" end="00:20:27.299" style="s2">fixation its acetic acid its vinegar so</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.899" end="00:20:29.429" style="s2">that is the central molecule for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.299" end="00:20:31.950" style="s2">deepest part of the biosphere and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.429" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">thing&#39;s really fascinating is that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.950" end="00:20:36.179" style="s2">been looking more recently at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:37.799" style="s2">organization in the amino acids sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.179" end="00:20:40.499" style="s2">continuing our interest in the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.799" end="00:20:43.320" style="s2">code and you could say okay if acetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.499" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">acid is the core molecule for fixing</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.320" end="00:20:47.730" style="s2">carbon and the start of biochemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:49.860" style="s2">there a central molecule for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.730" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">beginning of everything complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.860" end="00:20:55.049" style="s2">the answer to that looks like yes to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.789" style="s2">that central molecule is pyruvic acid so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.049" end="00:21:00.059" style="s2">biology is full of these little core</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.789" end="00:21:02.399" style="s2">linchpins and in the way Harold and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.059" end="00:21:04.830" style="s2">and others who are a similar mind looked</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.399" end="00:21:07.049" style="s2">at the origin of life we look at these</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.830" end="00:21:09.210" style="s2">as the circumstantial evidence for where</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.049" end="00:21:11.369" style="s2">to to put the search light to do small</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.210" end="00:21:12.649" style="s2">molecule chemistry that is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.369" end="00:21:15.240" style="s2">interesting now when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.649" end="00:21:17.309" style="s2">catalytic cycles it brings to mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.240" end="00:21:19.350" style="s2">another guest we had on the show earlier</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.309" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">Stu Kaufman and his auto catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.350" end="00:21:23.999" style="s2">networks can you maybe compare your</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">ideas to his and how they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.999" end="00:21:28.169" style="s2">now they&#39;re similar yeah so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:30.119" style="s2">truism that one has to start with if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.169" end="00:21:31.710" style="s2">were just doing equilibrium physics you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.119" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">can have organization that just sits</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.710" end="00:21:36.059" style="s2">there you know a diamond will just sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:38.129" style="s2">there for a very very long time because</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.059" end="00:21:40.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a stable configuration under some</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.129" end="00:21:42.230" style="s2">circumstances in metastable under</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.850" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">but if you&#39;re looking at dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:47.659" style="s2">stability like we have in the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:50.419" style="s2">everything falls apart so the only kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.659" end="00:21:52.700" style="s2">of patterns that can persist are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.419" end="00:21:54.890" style="s2">ones that continually renew themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.700" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">now renewal can happen by a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.890" end="00:21:59.149" style="s2">process than the process that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">patterns origin in the first place but</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.149" end="00:22:02.809" style="s2">the simplest kind of renewal would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:04.309" style="s2">one in which the mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.809" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">generated the process at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.309" end="00:22:09.830" style="s2">are those that continue to rebuild it as</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.370" end="00:22:11.240" style="s2">we go now if you ask what this looks</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.830" end="00:22:13.909" style="s2">like in material</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.240" end="00:22:15.380" style="s2">well organization and material means</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.909" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">you&#39;re putting a lot of your material</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.380" end="00:22:20.330" style="s2">into a few forms a few biomolecules a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:22.309" style="s2">few genes a few regulatory circuits</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.330" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">falling apart means that that material</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.309" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">drifts into the places that are not part</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:30.470" style="s2">of the organization so you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:31.820" style="s2">what then moves material back into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.470" end="00:22:34.669" style="s2">core of the organization</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.820" end="00:22:37.429" style="s2">that&#39;s what Auto catalysis does auto</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.669" end="00:22:39.350" style="s2">catalysis says we&#39;ll take things from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.429" end="00:22:41.480" style="s2">general and diverse environment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.350" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll concentrate them into a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:46.519" style="s2">outputs but those outputs will be like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.440" style="s2">kind of flypaper they&#39;re sticky for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.519" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">general environment and when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.440" end="00:22:52.399" style="s2">environmental components stick to them</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.019" style="s2">they get converted into the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.399" end="00:22:54.380" style="s2">material that the flight paper is made</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.019" end="00:22:57.500" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.380" end="00:23:01.370" style="s2">that&#39;s what Stu&#39;s insight is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.500" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">also what we recognize to be true so if</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.370" end="00:23:06.289" style="s2">you look at biochemistry it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.299" style="s2">auto catalytic cycles and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.289" end="00:23:10.669" style="s2">things that allow biochemistry to remain</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.299" end="00:23:12.049" style="s2">integrated and purified in an</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.669" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">environment where things are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.049" end="00:23:16.250" style="s2">falling apart the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:18.529" style="s2">Stu&#39;s approach and ours is the stew</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.250" end="00:23:21.019" style="s2">starts from a very unstructured flat</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.529" end="00:23:23.029" style="s2">kind of a combinatorial medium it can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.019" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">boolean networks it can be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.029" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">abstracted models for gene regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:30.710" style="s2">networks and he wants the laws of large</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:33.019" style="s2">numbers to give him feedbacks in those</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:34.190" style="s2">large networks that can be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.019" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">to do if you&#39;re looking at for instance</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.190" end="00:23:38.389" style="s2">gene regulation if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:41.000" style="s2">biochemistry the important thing about</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.389" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">biochemistry that&#39;s new in science is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.000" end="00:23:45.889" style="s2">that chemistry itself is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:48.289" style="s2">structured medium and we have never in</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.169" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">when you get down into the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.549" end="00:24:00.350" style="s2">chemistry you have systems that have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:02.179" style="s2">lot of structure and the leading edge is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.350" end="00:24:04.130" style="s2">going to be to understand what</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.350" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">up in complex adaptive and emergent</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">systems is the fact that they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:24.740" style="s2">far from equilibrium as you said in</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.580" end="00:24:27.290" style="s2">static physics diamond just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.740" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">there that&#39;s one thing but the systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.290" end="00:24:30.980" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about need energy flowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:32.990" style="s2">through them I know some of the SFI</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.980" end="00:24:35.660" style="s2">people don&#39;t like his formalism but</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.990" end="00:24:37.429" style="s2">Frigga genes idea of dissipative systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.660" end="00:24:40.610" style="s2">for instance talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.429" end="00:24:42.860" style="s2">the energy fluxes and how they push the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.610" end="00:24:44.780" style="s2">system far from equilibrium and how that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.860" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">is involved in the evolution from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.780" end="00:24:48.679" style="s2">abiotic to the biotic route yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:50.330" style="s2">good I don&#39;t want to downplay the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.679" end="00:24:52.520" style="s2">importance of energy flow because in</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.330" end="00:24:54.470" style="s2">practical problems it often is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.520" end="00:24:56.360" style="s2">that determines but I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.470" end="00:24:59.510" style="s2">overplay the importance of energy flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.360" end="00:25:01.580" style="s2">because it&#39;s only incidental and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.510" end="00:25:03.559" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re talking about material</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.580" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">systems that gives energy such a large</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.559" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">role if we really open our minds and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:09.220" style="s2">look at the statistics of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:12.620" style="s2">self-organization in the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.220" end="00:25:14.660" style="s2">energy becomes only one of the flows</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.620" end="00:25:16.220" style="s2">that can become important and there may</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.660" end="00:25:19.250" style="s2">be other things that are not the flows</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:20.900" style="s2">of something that are important so just</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:22.549" style="s2">put a flag on that that we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.900" end="00:25:24.470" style="s2">about the particular but we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.549" end="00:25:29.900" style="s2">our minds open that the concept is more</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.470" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">general so in thermodynamics energy is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.900" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">one of the quantities that tells you how</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:36.980" style="s2">much of your state space is available to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:38.900" style="s2">you other quantities are what are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.980" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">made of how much of each chemical do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.900" end="00:25:43.370" style="s2">have how much of each element but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">volume are you partitioned how much</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:48.530" style="s2">space can you take up so in equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:51.710" style="s2">the internal energy you have in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.530" end="00:25:54.140" style="s2">system is essentially set the volume you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:55.400" style="s2">have your material composition is set so</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.140" end="00:25:58.010" style="s2">the part of your state space you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.400" end="00:26:01.940" style="s2">explore is fixed as you go away from</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.010" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">equilibrium you can couple one system to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.940" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">boundary conditions that would not be an</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.570" style="s2">with each other which allows energy to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:10.460" style="s2">then flow in through one boundary and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.570" end="00:26:12.230" style="s2">flow out through another if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.460" end="00:26:14.570" style="s2">talking about the origin of life you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.230" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">have energy flow in in the form of one</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.570" end="00:26:18.590" style="s2">molecule and flow out in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.870" style="s2">some other molecule energy flow in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.590" end="00:26:23.540" style="s2">pre gaussian sense remains important</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.870" end="00:26:26.300" style="s2">because the more information you provide</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.540" end="00:26:28.430" style="s2">about the boundary conditions the less</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.300" end="00:26:30.650" style="s2">freedom your system has to explore</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.430" end="00:26:34.490" style="s2">another way to say that is that the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.650" end="00:26:36.920" style="s2">ordered the system can be so a driven</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.490" end="00:26:38.450" style="s2">system always has more information in</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.920" end="00:26:41.030" style="s2">the boundary conditions than one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.450" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">not driven because if I&#39;m at equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.030" end="00:26:45.710" style="s2">all of my energetic boundaries have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:47.870" style="s2">be in equilibrium with each other I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.710" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">go away from equilibrium in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.870" end="00:26:50.660" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like Tolstoy all</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:52.730" style="s2">equilibrium systems are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.660" end="00:26:54.680" style="s2">alike every disequilibrium system is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.730" end="00:26:56.630" style="s2">disequilibrium in its own fashion I like</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.680" end="00:26:58.310" style="s2">that I can move the energetic boundary</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.630" end="00:27:00.020" style="s2">conditions out of equilibrium with each</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.310" end="00:27:01.910" style="s2">other in a lot of ways I can put energy</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.020" end="00:27:03.500" style="s2">and in different molecules I can take it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.910" end="00:27:06.560" style="s2">out in different molecules I can have</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.500" end="00:27:09.170" style="s2">temperature gradients once I do that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.560" end="00:27:11.480" style="s2">restriction on the system&#39;s freedom can</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.170" end="00:27:12.890" style="s2">take many more forms than the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.480" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">restrictions I had available in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.890" end="00:27:17.420" style="s2">equilibrium and this is what Harold</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:19.370" style="s2">meant when he said the flow of energy</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.420" end="00:27:21.980" style="s2">through a system tends to organize the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.370" end="00:27:24.500" style="s2">system now the interesting thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.980" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">would say Prigogine does not go far</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.500" end="00:27:29.510" style="s2">enough from equilibrium because if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:31.190" style="s2">look at the work that he&#39;s doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.510" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">work that has continued in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.190" end="00:27:37.010" style="s2">many very fine workers who followed him</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:40.010" style="s2">they still want the equilibrium state</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.010" end="00:27:42.680" style="s2">variables to be the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.010" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">gives order to the system so they want</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.680" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">pressure and temperature and chemical</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.390" end="00:27:49.040" style="s2">potentials in the bath to re equal a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:52.130" style="s2">break quickly so that then they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.040" end="00:27:54.470" style="s2">study the information in a system that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.130" end="00:27:57.260" style="s2">moves slowly and episodically in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:28:00.200" style="s2">fast equilibrating bath but when you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.260" end="00:28:02.660" style="s2">do something even more radical than that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.200" end="00:28:04.850" style="s2">which is that we can ask what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.660" end="00:28:08.060" style="s2">native thermodynamics of any stochastic</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.850" end="00:28:10.400" style="s2">process driven in any way at all then</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.060" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">you contain the Prigogine class as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.400" end="00:28:16.550" style="s2">subsystem but you can also go much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:17.900" style="s2">general you can go into what I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.550" end="00:28:20.270" style="s2">call the thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.900" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">of rule-based systems the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.270" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">things that Walter Fontana and his</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">collaborators work on for systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:30.050" style="s2">biology or the theory of chemical</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:32.090" style="s2">reaction networks regarded as systems in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.050" end="00:28:33.850" style="s2">their own right rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.090" end="00:28:36.860" style="s2">expressions of the surrounding physics</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.850" end="00:28:38.990" style="s2">so I agree but I want us to be more</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.860" end="00:28:41.480" style="s2">radical and more exploratory even than</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.990" end="00:28:43.220" style="s2">precocious generation could be excellent</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.480" end="00:28:45.290" style="s2">even stronger perspective you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.220" end="00:28:47.180" style="s2">earlier that this origin of life work is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.290" end="00:28:50.090" style="s2">interesting and kind of different in</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.180" end="00:28:52.820" style="s2">that we only know a little and the box</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.090" end="00:28:54.740" style="s2">is big could you relatively briefly say</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.820" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">what you know or what you think you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:28:58.790" style="s2">about what&#39;s inside the box yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.260" style="s2">great it&#39;s a bunch of little islands</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.790" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">where we have repositories of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.260" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">information and about those we can hope</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.500" style="s2">to say a lot and then there are these</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:09.920" style="s2">big areas where you don&#39;t even hear good</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.500" end="00:29:11.870" style="s2">ideas being floated so I mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.920" end="00:29:14.180" style="s2">core biochemistry the carbon fixation</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.870" end="00:29:16.550" style="s2">pathways the chemistry surrounding the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.180" end="00:29:19.130" style="s2">citric acid cycle the reactions that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.550" end="00:29:21.140" style="s2">tend to get used and how they&#39;re used we</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.130" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">have lots of recorded information there</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.140" end="00:29:25.280" style="s2">and probably it&#39;s not even recorded</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:27.380" style="s2">probably this is actually an extension</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.280" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">of the periodic table that is being</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.380" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">expressed by the rigidity of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">biosphere you go up a level and look at</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:37.130" style="s2">the ribosome and all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:40.520" style="s2">have an extraordinary repository of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.130" end="00:29:43.370" style="s2">history about RNA and early peptides and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.520" end="00:29:45.260" style="s2">the emergence of translation and we</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.260" end="00:29:50.030" style="s2">froze into place and yet we know an</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.630" end="00:29:52.490" style="s2">amazing amount about what it froze into</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.030" end="00:29:54.560" style="s2">place so we&#39;ve been given the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.490" end="00:29:56.690" style="s2">a final exam but we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.560" end="00:29:58.310" style="s2">questions on that exam were that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.690" end="00:30:01.880" style="s2">another place where we have a streetlamp</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.310" end="00:30:04.210" style="s2">giving us tremendous light a place where</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.880" end="00:30:07.280" style="s2">these two intersect is the genetic code</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.210" end="00:30:09.500" style="s2">traditionally the genetic code has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.280" end="00:30:11.720" style="s2">viewed as a problem of assignment or</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.500" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">shuffling where people take the amino</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.720" end="00:30:16.460" style="s2">acids as somehow given and they take RNA</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">and the translation system is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.460" end="00:30:20.300" style="s2">given and then they look for how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:23.300" style="s2">ways you could assign amino acids to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.300" end="00:30:24.620" style="s2">codons in the translation system I think</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.620" end="00:30:29.720" style="s2">nearly dynamic enough because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.140" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">think the amino acids were given I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.720" end="00:30:34.470" style="s2">the process of becoming biotic</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:36.299" style="s2">was integrated with the process of</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.299" end="00:30:41.580" style="s2">discovering how to fold and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.390" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">when we understand the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.580" end="00:30:45.690" style="s2">translation system in the genetic code</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:48.779" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna realize the regularities of</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.779" end="00:30:53.929" style="s2">regularities of the problem of folding</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.059" end="00:30:57.809" style="s2">and how easy or hard that problem was</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.929" end="00:31:00.450" style="s2">different for peptides and for RNA kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.809" end="00:31:03.350" style="s2">of bootstrapped themselves up and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.450" end="00:31:06.120" style="s2">we see recorded in the genetic code is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.350" end="00:31:08.130" style="s2">the way each system got as far as it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:10.230" style="s2">could and then hit a wall and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.130" end="00:31:12.269" style="s2">discovery in one of the other systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.230" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">that right now looks like it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.110" style="s2">next innovations and they jointly went</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.950" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">through that door so I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.110" end="00:31:23.669" style="s2">these little islands that have</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:34.049" style="s2">about interesting now this comes right</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.289" end="00:31:35.549" style="s2">next to one of my favorite topics one of</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.870" end="00:32:36.269" style="s2">for evolution that&#39;s well above the era</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.160" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">those places where you stand on the</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.790" end="00:33:09.450" style="s2">sources my mind&#39;s been out of this space</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.860" end="00:33:12.360" style="s2">for a little bit so it&#39;s gonna take me a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.450" end="00:33:15.480" style="s2">minute to to get my sources back in line</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.360" end="00:33:17.340" style="s2">a really great early thinker on this was</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.480" end="00:33:19.860" style="s2">herb Simon one of the early systems</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.340" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">thinkers across fields and Simon has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.860" end="00:33:24.990" style="s2">set of classic arguments about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">architecture of complex systems where he</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.990" end="00:33:29.820" style="s2">says kind of like politics all error</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.740" style="s2">correction is local and that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.820" end="00:33:33.300" style="s2">incidental actually this is true for any</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.740" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">distributed system and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.300" end="00:33:37.530" style="s2">decentralized banking came from in</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:39.930" style="s2">England if you have a complex control</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.530" end="00:33:42.810" style="s2">problem the higher order systems that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.930" end="00:33:44.790" style="s2">are your controllers are often made by</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.810" end="00:33:46.890" style="s2">assembling building blocks at a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.790" end="00:33:49.110" style="s2">scale but that means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.890" end="00:33:52.350" style="s2">coarser and the information bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.110" end="00:33:53.970" style="s2">through the interfaces is too small to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.350" end="00:33:56.330" style="s2">keep up with all the things that can go</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.970" end="00:33:59.580" style="s2">wrong internally to the building blocks</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.330" end="00:34:02.100" style="s2">so herb Simon used to argue that if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.580" end="00:34:05.100" style="s2">see a complex system in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.100" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">only plausible mechanism to have created</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.100" end="00:34:11.100" style="s2">that system is one that has integral</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">error correction in the subsystems along</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.100" end="00:34:16.620" style="s2">the way that creates sort of stable</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">intermediate states of assembly which</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.620" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">then provide platforms to explore from</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">for later assembly so herb Simon uses</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:25.710" style="s2">the analogy of watch assembly you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:27.840" style="s2">put a thousand pieces in a watch</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.710" end="00:34:30.870" style="s2">together holding them all in place and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.840" end="00:34:32.790" style="s2">then put a screw on the top instead you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.870" end="00:34:34.590" style="s2">assemble components of ten put each on</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.790" end="00:34:36.810" style="s2">the shelf you put ten of those together</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.590" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">to make assemblies of 100 put them on</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.810" end="00:34:41.490" style="s2">the shelf put ten of those together and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:43.560" style="s2">that&#39;s your assembled watch if you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.490" end="00:34:46.590" style="s2">never interrupted it wouldn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.560" end="00:34:48.360" style="s2">that you do those things but in a world</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.590" end="00:34:51.780" style="s2">where you really are interrupted it does</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.360" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">matter and he used also the example of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.780" end="00:34:57.090" style="s2">the Alexandrian Empire where Alexander&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:34:59.220" style="s2">Empire was only possible in a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.090" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">sophisticated state system where</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.220" end="00:35:03.450" style="s2">States could be left to manage their own</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">internal affairs so in looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.450" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">origin of life we are looking for where</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:10.740" style="s2">in chemistry the pads of least</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:12.840" style="s2">resistance tend to regress toward their</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:14.910" style="s2">own central tendencies so that your</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.840" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">control systems don&#39;t have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.910" end="00:35:19.080" style="s2">hurt them back in those directions the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">control systems can provide low</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.080" end="00:35:23.640" style="s2">bandwidth signals to sort of make the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:25.710" style="s2">major switches between the stable or</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.640" end="00:35:28.290" style="s2">metastable domains of attraction so do</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.710" end="00:35:31.710" style="s2">we have any ideas about what was on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.290" end="00:35:33.270" style="s2">pre side of DNA and its error correction</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.710" end="00:35:35.130" style="s2">architecture yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.270" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">let me give only one example that one</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.130" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">could go on for a long time think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">protein catalysis catalysis by proteins</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">is obtained by first making a fold</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.290" style="s2">architecture and then putting the side</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.109" style="s2">chains of a bunch of amino acids in very</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.290" end="00:35:50.609" style="s2">particular configuration that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.109" end="00:35:52.080" style="s2">thing to do because you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.609" end="00:35:54.660" style="s2">catalysis until you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.080" end="00:35:56.609" style="s2">supporting machinery so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.660" end="00:36:00.330" style="s2">understand how you could ever have had</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.609" end="00:36:02.760" style="s2">the catalysis the proteins enable you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.330" end="00:36:05.640" style="s2">would first say is there any catalysis</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.760" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">by small molecules that&#39;s doing much of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.640" end="00:36:10.080" style="s2">the job within a small assembly that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require this sequence</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.080" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">coordination to happen and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">fascinating thing is that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:19.890" style="s2">the reactions that involve RNA and DNA</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:22.589" style="s2">they often involve what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.890" end="00:36:25.080" style="s2">substrate assisted catalysis and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.589" end="00:36:27.810" style="s2">that means from the technical side is</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.080" end="00:36:31.080" style="s2">that the RNA molecule or the DNA</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.810" end="00:36:33.570" style="s2">molecule itself is defining most of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.080" end="00:36:36.119" style="s2">catalytic contexts and the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.570" end="00:36:38.310" style="s2">catalysts only needs to kind of orient</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.119" end="00:36:40.290" style="s2">the components it doesn&#39;t usually need</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.310" end="00:36:42.540" style="s2">to have its fingers in the transition</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.290" end="00:36:44.849" style="s2">state of the reaction which means that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.540" end="00:36:46.859" style="s2">much simpler surrounding environment can</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.849" end="00:36:49.770" style="s2">be catalytic for those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.859" end="00:36:51.570" style="s2">reactions it&#39;s fascinating that RNA and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.770" end="00:36:55.109" style="s2">DNA would be the place where those</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:09.170" style="s2">just kind of go back to exploring so</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.970" end="00:39:38.539" style="s2">that would be fine but why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:40.220" style="s2">start off by giving a general framing</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.539" end="00:39:42.619" style="s2">about what you were trying to get at in</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.220" end="00:39:44.269" style="s2">your work in money and finance yes so</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.619" end="00:39:45.799" style="s2">this was very much a merger of two minds</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.269" end="00:39:48.499" style="s2">and the leader on this was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.799" end="00:39:51.410" style="s2">martin shubik whose interest for his</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.499" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">entire career had been the institutional</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:01.970" style="s2">polity and within the society so Martin</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.210" end="00:40:04.369" style="s2">was a Rand era game theorist and he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.970" end="00:40:08.599" style="s2">an operations Research guy which means</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.369" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">he didn&#39;t pursue the economic view of</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:15.740" style="s2">look at neoclassical economics it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.759" end="00:40:18.200" style="s2">strongly rooted in preferences and sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.740" end="00:40:21.829" style="s2">of the idea of the decentralized actor</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.200" end="00:40:25.519" style="s2">and in much of the foundations of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.829" end="00:40:28.039" style="s2">theory institutions don&#39;t really need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.519" end="00:40:30.259" style="s2">exist they&#39;re sort of external</p>

<p begin="00:40:30.259" end="00:40:34.309" style="s2">have and what you really care about is</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.440" end="00:40:47.480" style="s2">sense at all in the world I actually</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.759" end="00:41:14.779" style="s2">conduits for what&#39;s possible so if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">want to understand the nature of money</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.779" end="00:41:19.789" style="s2">or in fact the nature of most of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:21.859" style="s2">institutionalized interaction with each</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.789" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">other we need to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:36.859" style="s2">sort of a primitive concept and a thing</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:44.839" style="s2">out of all the complexity of the</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.099" end="00:41:54.710" style="s2">congenial to my sort of physics and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.220" end="00:41:56.539" style="s2">mechanical approach to the world so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.710" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">would look at things like problems of</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.030" end="00:45:07.960" style="s2">determines the exchange price of gold</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.770" end="00:45:10.660" style="s2">against things you actually need like</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.960" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">food and cows and houses and shoes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.660" end="00:45:15.820" style="s2">stuff like that that number should be</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:18.940" style="s2">arbitrary if gold is infinitely durable</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.820" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s never a time when it said</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.940" end="00:45:23.560" style="s2">nothing anchors that arbitrariness now</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:26.470" style="s2">if you have consumption value for gold</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.560" end="00:45:28.270" style="s2">but it&#39;s in the far future so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.470" end="00:45:30.940" style="s2">can use it for jewelry but that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.270" end="00:45:34.390" style="s2">of a luxury maybe you can use it to pay</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.940" end="00:45:36.250" style="s2">taxes but that&#39;s a long horizon then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.390" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">can say that that consumption value will</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.250" end="00:45:41.230" style="s2">anchor the exchange value of gold but</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:44.050" style="s2">now we have a problem in the order in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.230" end="00:45:46.780" style="s2">which we take infinities if I take the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.050" end="00:45:49.180" style="s2">future infinitely far off then it seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.780" end="00:45:51.970" style="s2">that the value of gold should become</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.180" end="00:45:54.490" style="s2">arbitrary if I take the future close in</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.970" end="00:45:56.260" style="s2">then you&#39;re placing too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.490" end="00:45:58.180" style="s2">regulatory role on things like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.260" end="00:46:00.250" style="s2">payment of taxes and fiat money</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:02.410" style="s2">so then the question was how do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.250" end="00:46:04.300" style="s2">understand the actual fluctuations in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.410" end="00:46:06.940" style="s2">the trade value of things like fiat</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.300" end="00:46:10.300" style="s2">money or durables in the in the real</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.300" end="00:46:17.080" style="s2">that topic was that in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.890" end="00:46:19.090" style="s2">fluctuations have a way of creating</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.080" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">stabilizing effects because they put</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.090" end="00:46:23.020" style="s2">temporary uncertainties into the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:25.750" style="s2">where they bring actors into the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.020" end="00:46:29.380" style="s2">who would not be there if the sea were</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.750" end="00:46:31.840" style="s2">always flat and so in fact the right way</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.380" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">to look at the long run is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.840" end="00:46:36.970" style="s2">long run it&#39;s not the policing by very</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:38.440" style="s2">weak regulations that stabilize you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.970" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">the fact that the spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.440" end="00:46:42.310" style="s2">fluctuations and the set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:44.290" style="s2">uncertainties that they introduce become</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.310" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">the stabilizing force that take over</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.290" end="00:46:49.180" style="s2">from very weak policing actions in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:51.340" style="s2">long run and one of the chapters in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.180" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">book is a model of the Han paradox</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.340" end="00:46:54.760" style="s2">that&#39;s along those lines so to try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:56.710" style="s2">chip in that it&#39;s a little bit is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.760" end="00:46:59.020" style="s2">essentially saying that we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.710" end="00:47:01.000" style="s2">uncertainty to keep the game going and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.020" end="00:47:02.710" style="s2">if the game became too transparent it</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.000" end="00:47:05.230" style="s2">would stop working I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.710" end="00:47:07.540" style="s2">possible if you don&#39;t mind let me give</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.230" end="00:47:09.670" style="s2">you an analogy that captures the math</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.540" end="00:47:11.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not obviously about money but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.670" end="00:47:13.000" style="s2">comes from evolutionary game theory and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.770" end="00:47:14.470" style="s2">I should tell you there&#39;s a third book</p>

<p begin="00:47:14.470" end="00:47:19.180" style="s2">which is called symmetry and collective</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:27.310" style="s2">order it it&#39;s an institute of physics</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.240" end="00:47:28.870" style="s2">book it&#39;s sort of library only which</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.030" end="00:47:37.450" style="s2">one of these famous games where you can</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.730" end="00:48:35.619" style="s2">correctly in its fully dynamical sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.849" end="00:48:38.230" style="s2">you find that the things that stabilize</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.359" end="00:48:44.799" style="s2">almost more like solar flares they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.990" end="00:48:51.819" style="s2">there&#39;s a new kind of a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.579" end="00:48:54.999" style="s2">stabilization that you need to explain</p>

<p begin="00:49:47.349" end="00:49:51.099" style="s2">never discussed in our work together and</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.770" end="00:50:40.430" style="s2">that I think we could add to Martin&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.970" end="00:51:04.610" style="s2">know gold as a commodity money brings in</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.980" end="00:51:24.020" style="s2">where defacement of coinage came from so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.650" end="00:51:25.610" style="s2">now a functioning monetary system can</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.020" end="00:51:27.500" style="s2">increase the strength of the central</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.200" end="00:51:33.590" style="s2">then you can start to have base metals</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.290" end="00:51:55.700" style="s2">that give money systems more flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.570" end="00:51:57.800" style="s2">there&#39;s still more work to do in that</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.510" end="00:52:05.570" style="s2">done a fair amount of work on monetary</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.560" end="00:53:51.450" style="s2">set off the 2007-2008 problem absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.710" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">let me insert here just for the audience</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.450" end="00:53:56.130" style="s2">you know I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:59.220" style="s2">researching this in the 2008 to 2012</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.130" end="00:54:01.800" style="s2">range and I found one book that did the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.220" end="00:54:04.170" style="s2">best job called slapped by the invisible</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.800" end="00:54:06.060" style="s2">hand yes by Gary Gorton at Yale I</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.170" end="00:54:09.270" style="s2">believe his forensics is the correct one</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.060" end="00:54:10.530" style="s2">if there&#39;s a call out to folks that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.270" end="00:54:12.270" style="s2">might want to do their own reading in</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.530" end="00:54:14.370" style="s2">this Gary Gorton and also Michael</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.270" end="00:54:16.890" style="s2">Woodford those two were two we read</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.370" end="00:54:19.050" style="s2">heavily and in the Journal of economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.890" end="00:54:21.000" style="s2">literature they have some excellent</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.050" end="00:54:23.550" style="s2">articles some of which were collected in</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.000" end="00:54:26.300" style="s2">Gary&#39;s book so yeah super sources on</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.550" end="00:54:28.940" style="s2">both of those so if you look at the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.300" end="00:54:32.580" style="s2">markets for repurchase agreements work</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:35.580" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that if the securities behind</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.580" end="00:54:37.770" style="s2">them are priced using mark-to-market</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.580" end="00:54:39.300" style="s2">methods that system is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.770" end="00:54:41.640" style="s2">unstable</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.300" end="00:54:43.410" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like a classical</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.640" end="00:54:45.360" style="s2">electrical engineering design of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.410" end="00:54:47.490" style="s2">amplifiers you could write it down and</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.490" end="00:54:51.270" style="s2">circle I always wanted to do that never</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.500" end="00:54:52.650" style="s2">got around to it because it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.270" end="00:54:55.350" style="s2">perfect application of Martin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.650" end="00:54:57.090" style="s2">strategic market game formulation but</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.350" end="00:54:58.200" style="s2">after Gary and Michael had written I</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.090" end="00:55:00.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel like there were any new</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.200" end="00:55:02.610" style="s2">problems left for us to solve so it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.120" end="00:55:04.590" style="s2">never a priority to do but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.610" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">interesting thing you can ask is if</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.590" end="00:55:09.090" style="s2">everybody knows it&#39;s unstable why did</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:12.050" style="s2">they go into it or if they know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.090" end="00:55:15.360" style="s2">it&#39;s unstable because mark-to-market</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:17.310" style="s2">intrinsically replaces the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.360" end="00:55:19.080" style="s2">that is the assumption for</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.310" end="00:55:21.300" style="s2">representative agents and stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.080" end="00:55:23.310" style="s2">the economy with a sort of a mechanized</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.300" end="00:55:26.250" style="s2">everybody steps on the same foot at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.310" end="00:55:27.930" style="s2">same time why would they do that well</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.250" end="00:55:29.940" style="s2">they do it because it gives you legal</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.930" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">defensibility you can claim you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.940" end="00:55:34.530" style="s2">best practices when you get sued so this</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.760" end="00:55:36.120" style="s2">was one of Martin&#39;s favorite things when</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.530" end="00:55:39.000" style="s2">you look at something pathological in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.120" end="00:55:42.210" style="s2">the economy look for where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.000" end="00:55:44.010" style="s2">the law as its origin and so the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:46.770" style="s2">interesting question about all of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.010" end="00:55:50.040" style="s2">is how does the legal system create</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.770" end="00:55:52.770" style="s2">homogenize ation in people&#39;s actions by</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.040" end="00:55:55.590" style="s2">replacing their intrinsic diversity with</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.770" end="00:55:58.680" style="s2">algorithmic homogeneity and then how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.590" end="00:56:01.080" style="s2">these institutions like mark-to-market</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.680" end="00:56:03.210" style="s2">interact with the adoption of repurchase</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.080" end="00:56:05.010" style="s2">agreements on very fast turnover markets</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.210" end="00:56:07.020" style="s2">to create a system that has these</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.010" end="00:56:09.210" style="s2">overnight instabilities a huge scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.020" end="00:56:10.560" style="s2">yeah not only the first-order effect but</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.210" end="00:56:12.570" style="s2">I thought what Gorton was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.560" end="00:56:14.760" style="s2">brilliant at was he looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.570" end="00:56:17.160" style="s2">phenomena of rehypothecation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.760" end="00:56:19.530" style="s2">collateral in the repo market which was</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.160" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">a very peculiar thing but turned I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.530" end="00:56:23.730" style="s2">believe and I think Gorton does too was</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.240" end="00:56:26.040" style="s2">the actual spring that imploded and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.730" end="00:56:27.600" style="s2">caused what was a big economic error</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.040" end="00:56:29.370" style="s2">about a trillion dollars worth of bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.600" end="00:56:31.170" style="s2">mortgages into a near collapse of</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.090" end="00:56:36.360" style="s2">they were the one of the biggest players</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.320" end="00:56:38.790" style="s2">in a repo market and they get a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.360" end="00:56:40.770" style="s2">collateralized mortgage obligations in</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.790" end="00:56:43.500" style="s2">the form of a security as collateral for</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.770" end="00:56:46.590" style="s2">their repo they are allowed under US law</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.500" end="00:56:49.650" style="s2">to take 40% of that Andry lend it to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.590" end="00:56:51.450" style="s2">somebody else that person can do 40% etc</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.650" end="00:56:53.010" style="s2">in London it&#39;s a hundred percent so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.450" end="00:56:55.080" style="s2">can essentially have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.010" end="00:56:56.850" style="s2">infinite expansion of the near money</p>

<p begin="00:56:59.610" end="00:57:03.150" style="s2">and when Lehman went down and panic</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.310" end="00:57:06.810" style="s2">ensued</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.150" end="00:57:08.970" style="s2">everybody refused to take we hypothesize</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.810" end="00:57:11.550" style="s2">collateral and this gigantic six</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.970" end="00:57:14.010" style="s2">trillion dollar pseudo money near money</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.550" end="00:57:16.200" style="s2">phenomenon imploded down to about five</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.010" end="00:57:18.090" style="s2">hundred and fifty billions so more than</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:20.940" style="s2">90 percent of it disappeared in two</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.090" end="00:57:22.830" style="s2">weeks and that was the shock wave that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.940" end="00:57:25.260" style="s2">almost brought the house down yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.830" end="00:57:27.330" style="s2">is wonderful it brings up two other</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.260" end="00:57:29.820" style="s2">people that I think we want to call out</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.330" end="00:57:31.800" style="s2">in this conversation one is John Jana</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.820" end="00:57:34.860" style="s2">Capello&#39;s who was interested in haircut</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.800" end="00:57:38.220" style="s2">revaluation but your real point is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.860" end="00:57:39.870" style="s2">the magnitude of the bad death was</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.220" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">absorbable but the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.870" end="00:57:44.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t know where it was was what pulled</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.740" style="s2">down the system and for this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.610" end="00:57:49.290" style="s2">wonderful book Hyman Minsky stabilising</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.740" end="00:57:51.420" style="s2">an unstable economy and I can use your</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.290" end="00:57:53.730" style="s2">podcast to get a term out in circulation</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.420" end="00:57:56.610" style="s2">that I never got to use in a paper I</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.730" end="00:58:01.020" style="s2">want to call that argument Minsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.610" end="00:58:04.290" style="s2">ratchet which is that during stable</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.020" end="00:58:06.240" style="s2">times when you need regulation you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.290" end="00:58:09.540" style="s2">muster the political will to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.240" end="00:58:11.250" style="s2">regulation in the necessary forms and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.540" end="00:58:13.020" style="s2">the quality of credit degrades and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.250" end="00:58:16.740" style="s2">degrades through innovations like</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.020" end="00:58:18.990" style="s2">rehypothecation then when things go bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.740" end="00:58:20.790" style="s2">there&#39;s only one actor who can act on</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.990" end="00:58:22.770" style="s2">the necessary scale and on the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.790" end="00:58:25.260" style="s2">short time frame and that&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.770" end="00:58:27.090" style="s2">bank and the government and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.260" end="00:58:29.460" style="s2">government that will choose not to act</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.090" end="00:58:31.410" style="s2">unless it chooses to collapse its own</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.460" end="00:58:33.030" style="s2">economic system so it almost doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.410" end="00:58:34.800" style="s2">matter who&#39;s in power if you have anyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.030" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">who&#39;s not willing to implode the country</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.800" end="00:58:39.090" style="s2">that actor is gonna bail the system out</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.950" style="s2">everybody&#39;s gonna howl about it but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.090" end="00:58:42.990" style="s2">horse is out of the gate the time when</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.950" end="00:58:45.930" style="s2">you needed regulation is passed</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.990" end="00:58:47.550" style="s2">you can put the regulation on ex-post</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.930" end="00:58:49.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s too much entropy in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.550" end="00:58:51.390" style="s2">system that money has been dispersed</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.230" end="00:58:53.970" style="s2">there&#39;s too much information gone and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.390" end="00:58:56.310" style="s2">you can&#39;t recover it which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.970" end="00:58:57.960" style="s2">saw in the mortgage-backed securities</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.310" end="00:59:01.770" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.960" end="00:59:04.140" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a meta question here how</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.770" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">do we overcome Minsky&#39;s ratchet how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.140" end="00:59:08.760" style="s2">we maintain political and legal</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:11.010" style="s2">vigilance so that it&#39;s active during the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.760" end="00:59:12.990" style="s2">times when it&#39;s needed but people are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.010" end="00:59:14.730" style="s2">comfortable and they&#39;re not good at</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.990" end="00:59:17.910" style="s2">assessing the fragility in the system</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.730" end="00:59:20.099" style="s2">and ideas well this is what the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.910" end="00:59:23.070" style="s2">risk people ought to have good ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.099" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">I have not done original work in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.070" end="00:59:25.830" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">apart from sort of thinking that this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.830" end="00:59:31.410" style="s2">the problem so no I I can&#39;t offer much</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.060" style="s2">that I think has substance in this too</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.410" end="00:59:35.820" style="s2">bad that would have been fun now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.060" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">talk a little bit about money versus its</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.820" end="00:59:40.290" style="s2">substitutes various near monies did you</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:42.089" style="s2">guys look into that any yes a lot one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.290" end="00:59:45.510" style="s2">Martin&#39;s ideas was that money is only</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.089" end="00:59:49.770" style="s2">made effective when it is surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.510" end="00:59:51.630" style="s2">suitable forms of credit that give the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.770" end="00:59:54.060" style="s2">degrees of flexibility that the central</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.630" end="00:59:55.349" style="s2">money system can&#39;t and he was always</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.060" end="00:59:57.450" style="s2">interested in things like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.349" end="00:59:59.240" style="s2">monetization of personal credit concepts</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.450" end="01:00:02.450" style="s2">like the real bills doctrine that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:05.400" style="s2">supported much of mercantil English</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.450" end="01:00:07.080" style="s2">traffic what what did we call it when</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.400" end="01:00:09.570" style="s2">England was the Merchant Marine of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.080" end="01:00:10.290" style="s2">world mercantile capitalism I guess yep</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.570" end="01:00:12.900" style="s2">sounds reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.290" end="01:00:14.940" style="s2">yeah so he was interested in how you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.900" end="01:00:17.550" style="s2">take things like promissory notes that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.940" end="01:00:18.869" style="s2">are generated in a local distributed</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.550" end="01:00:22.650" style="s2">fashion and which are therefore</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.869" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">sensitive to local conditions and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.650" end="01:00:27.660" style="s2">what the bank wants is a credit</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:29.880" style="s2">evaluation feature that will allow it to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.660" end="01:00:33.330" style="s2">pick and choose among these distributed</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.880" end="01:00:35.640" style="s2">instruments monetizing them stabilizing</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.330" end="01:00:36.990" style="s2">them by trading them for things like</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.640" end="01:00:40.530" style="s2">government money or gold</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:00:42.270" style="s2">thus leveraging their flexibility but</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.530" end="01:00:44.220" style="s2">then giving them the stability to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.270" end="01:00:47.490" style="s2">function as money&#39;s on a much larger</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.220" end="01:00:49.650" style="s2">scale the reason Martin was interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.490" end="01:00:51.420" style="s2">in this is that it highlights the need</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.650" end="01:00:53.490" style="s2">for trusts and institutions as the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.420" end="01:00:55.349" style="s2">foundation of money because when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.490" end="01:00:57.780" style="s2">have these near monies or monetized</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.349" end="01:01:00.270" style="s2">credits you can have a many fold</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.780" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">expansion of the volume of trade that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.270" end="01:01:05.099" style="s2">supported but exactly as you say when</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:06.990" style="s2">rehypothecation came to not be trusted</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.099" end="01:01:08.550" style="s2">you can have the collapse of all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.990" end="01:01:10.619" style="s2">these near monies down to sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.550" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">core of trusted money which can be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.619" end="01:01:13.670" style="s2">small fraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:16.290" style="s2">of what the trade-in process had been</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.670" end="01:01:17.790" style="s2">assuming very true when it worked it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.290" end="01:01:19.890" style="s2">worked when it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.790" end="01:01:21.630" style="s2">seems to be the nature of monetary</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.890" end="01:01:23.400" style="s2">systems right and for those who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.630" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">interested in some of this I have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.400" end="01:01:27.360" style="s2">hour-and-a-half video called dividend</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:28.770" style="s2">money might check it out on YouTube this</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.360" end="01:01:30.210" style="s2">has been very interesting on before we</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.770" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">go though on money of course I have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.210" end="01:01:34.380" style="s2">ask you what are your thoughts about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">new alternative currencies the crypto</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.380" end="01:01:38.910" style="s2">currencies etc can they possibly escape</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">their little miniature basins of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.910" end="01:01:42.930" style="s2">attraction and become significant not in</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:44.940" style="s2">the trivializing way that their</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.930" end="01:01:47.100" style="s2">proponents hope there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.940" end="01:01:49.740" style="s2">simplified view of the world that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.100" end="01:01:51.810" style="s2">sees a lot in engineering which comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.740" end="01:01:53.490" style="s2">from knowing one system very well and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.810" end="01:01:55.350" style="s2">imagining that that&#39;s a surrogate for</p>

<p begin="01:04:02.630" end="01:04:05.480" style="s2">a little bit about how you got</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.310" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">there yes the languages have always been</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.260" end="01:04:13.460" style="s2">a joy they&#39;re a thing that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:15.560" style="s2">embedded in we have an enormous amount</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.470" end="01:04:22.730" style="s2">whatever languages surround us and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:24.410" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s a young kid and encounters</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.730" end="01:04:27.980" style="s2">some foreign languages for the first</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.410" end="01:04:29.840" style="s2">time will have experienced this wonder</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.980" end="01:04:32.300" style="s2">that things in a foreign language</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.840" end="01:04:33.710" style="s2">suddenly make sense of things in your</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.300" end="01:04:34.280" style="s2">own language that you never understood</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.710" end="01:04:36.740" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.280" end="01:04:38.390" style="s2">so you know if you grow up as a speaker</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.740" end="01:04:40.520" style="s2">of English you should be perplexed and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.390" end="01:04:42.740" style="s2">appalled that it&#39;s even a pronounceable</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.520" end="01:04:45.050" style="s2">language because it&#39;s rules are so</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.740" end="01:04:46.940" style="s2">Byzantine but then if you encounter</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.050" end="01:04:49.100" style="s2">Italian which is a logical language</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.940" end="01:04:51.020" style="s2">suddenly you realize that half of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.100" end="01:04:53.210" style="s2">English is logical but it&#39;s the logic of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.020" end="01:04:55.250" style="s2">Latin and then the other half you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.210" end="01:04:57.470" style="s2">recognize as logical but it&#39;s the logic</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.250" end="01:04:59.930" style="s2">of German and in English starts to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.470" end="01:05:02.570" style="s2">become comprehensible so when we went to</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.930" end="01:05:04.760" style="s2">SFI and I encountered a group that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.570" end="01:05:06.560" style="s2">seriously working on reconstructing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.760" end="01:05:09.080" style="s2">history of all of the world&#39;s languages</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.560" end="01:05:12.110" style="s2">as a platform from which to understand</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.080" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">language as a phenomenon I thought okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.110" end="01:05:14.780" style="s2">this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:17.780" style="s2">can&#39;t pass this up</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.780" end="01:05:19.310" style="s2">but the thing that&#39;s fascinating is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.780" end="01:05:23.390" style="s2">linguistics is an excessively</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.310" end="01:05:25.610" style="s2">conservative field and they resisted</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.390" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">using modern probability methods much</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.610" end="01:05:30.290" style="s2">longer than they should have they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:31.880" style="s2">starting to do it now but it&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.290" end="01:05:35.540" style="s2">decades later than it should have been</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.880" end="01:05:37.530" style="s2">so at SFI the linguist wanted to engage</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.540" end="01:05:39.180" style="s2">the biologists</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.530" end="01:05:42.450" style="s2">who had been using probability methods</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.180" end="01:05:44.940" style="s2">for genomics for some decades but that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.450" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">was often a frustrating exchange and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.940" end="01:05:50.370" style="s2">was frustrating because of human</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:51.900" style="s2">difficulty the biologists were too</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.370" end="01:05:54.090" style="s2">arrogant thinking they had solved</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.900" end="01:05:55.950" style="s2">problems and too uninterested in</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.090" end="01:05:59.010" style="s2">learning the depth of what linguists</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.950" end="01:06:00.690" style="s2">knew about the structure of language</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.010" end="01:06:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s different from the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.690" end="01:06:06.270" style="s2">genome dynamics and the linguists were</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.320" end="01:06:08.820" style="s2">too stuck in the mud to try to use a</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.270" end="01:06:10.530" style="s2">polite term to be willing to put in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.820" end="01:06:12.210" style="s2">hard work of being students of</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.530" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">probability methods and really taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.210" end="01:06:16.380" style="s2">them on in their modern form and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:18.840" style="s2">remember witnessing these exchanges and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.380" end="01:06:21.750" style="s2">thinking this is insane if either side</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.840" end="01:06:24.060" style="s2">of this would exercise little humility</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.750" end="01:06:26.130" style="s2">and really become a student of the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.060" end="01:06:29.100" style="s2">side we could open up this whole study</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.130" end="01:06:31.860" style="s2">so that of course turned out to be a lot</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.100" end="01:06:34.050" style="s2">harder to do than to complain about and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.860" end="01:06:36.030" style="s2">it took us seven years of work to get</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.050" end="01:06:38.820" style="s2">the manpower to actually do a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.030" end="01:06:40.260" style="s2">simple version of this problem by the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.820" end="01:06:42.180" style="s2">time we got it done and got it published</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.260" end="01:06:44.460" style="s2">the rest of the world was already</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.180" end="01:06:47.010" style="s2">starting to do this at a good level but</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.460" end="01:06:48.660" style="s2">this system is still really gold on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.010" end="01:06:50.850" style="s2">ground for whoever wants to start to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.660" end="01:06:52.560" style="s2">work in this area because we know so</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.850" end="01:06:54.090" style="s2">much about probability methods and we</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.560" end="01:06:56.550" style="s2">know so much about the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.090" end="01:06:59.970" style="s2">language but to really work from whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.550" end="01:07:02.100" style="s2">cloth and make probabilistic models of</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.970" end="01:07:04.530" style="s2">the intrinsic dynamics of language use</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.100" end="01:07:07.140" style="s2">and language change that is yet to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.530" end="01:07:08.760" style="s2">done and some young generation with time</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.140" end="01:07:10.020" style="s2">that wants to pick this up can really</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.760" end="01:07:12.390" style="s2">create a new field</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.020" end="01:07:14.670" style="s2">you mentioned language change I know</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.390" end="01:07:16.530" style="s2">that was a big interest of the SFI group</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.670" end="01:07:18.810" style="s2">working around language what insights</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.530" end="01:07:21.120" style="s2">did you get about how languages evolved</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.810" end="01:07:23.580" style="s2">and change it presents I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.120" end="01:07:25.470" style="s2">answer you as a physicist because I love</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.580" end="01:07:27.390" style="s2">the phenomena in themselves in their</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.470" end="01:07:30.590" style="s2">diversity but I also like the patterns</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.390" end="01:07:33.450" style="s2">that we see they unify the phenomena and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.590" end="01:07:36.900" style="s2">the interesting thing is that with</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.450" end="01:07:38.910" style="s2">genome change we can get a long way by</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.900" end="01:07:40.890" style="s2">looking at changes that are not context</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.910" end="01:07:42.660" style="s2">dependent so you can look at the flips</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.890" end="01:07:45.210" style="s2">of individual bases and how they create</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.660" end="01:07:46.860" style="s2">your properties and organisms or how</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.210" end="01:07:48.020" style="s2">they don&#39;t create new properties so they</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.860" end="01:07:51.310" style="s2">can stay around for long</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.020" end="01:07:53.720" style="s2">time is a signature of population splits</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.310" end="01:07:57.980" style="s2">language only functions because its</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.720" end="01:07:59.360" style="s2">components are a system there&#39;s no magic</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.980" end="01:08:02.270" style="s2">and the fact that I begin the word</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.360" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">language with Allah sound except that</p>

<p begin="01:08:06.770" end="01:08:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what gives it its meaning it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.650" end="01:08:18.680" style="s2">gonna have to do it in all of the places</p>

<p begin="01:08:18.680" end="01:08:22.190" style="s2">time and it&#39;s gonna have to change for</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.870" end="01:08:26.180" style="s2">all the speakers of English at the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.190" end="01:08:29.930" style="s2">time that makes the modeling of language</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.180" end="01:08:31.580" style="s2">change a very different problem than the</p>

<p begin="01:08:40.670" end="01:08:44.660" style="s2">because context discovery remains a hard</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.069" end="01:08:47.630" style="s2">problem it&#39;s one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.660" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">problems in deep learning I would love</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.630" end="01:08:52.730" style="s2">to see the deep learning community which</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:55.100" style="s2">has been so data centric start to take</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.730" end="01:08:57.890" style="s2">more of an interest in grammar discovery</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.100" end="01:08:59.569" style="s2">syntax discovery and things like that to</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.890" end="01:09:02.180" style="s2">which they have been resistant so far</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.569" end="01:09:05.000" style="s2">because I think we will learn more about</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.180" end="01:09:07.609" style="s2">the nature of grammar when we start to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.000" end="01:09:09.680" style="s2">ask deep learning systems to unpack what</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.609" end="01:09:12.020" style="s2">they know about language like the zero</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.680" end="01:09:13.640" style="s2">shot translation so that they can start</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.020" end="01:09:15.560" style="s2">to discover things about grammar and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.640" end="01:09:18.020" style="s2">syntax that we have not yet observed</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.560" end="01:09:19.940" style="s2">makes sense because it is reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.020" end="01:09:21.980" style="s2">close right unfortunately it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.940" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">way that most deep learning people are</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.980" end="01:09:25.130" style="s2">thinking though there are beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:27.109" style="s2">be some people who are willing to think</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.130" end="01:09:28.850" style="s2">about what&#39;s inside the black box and</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.109" end="01:09:30.589" style="s2">how to interpret the black box and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.850" end="01:09:32.240" style="s2">something closer to symbolic terms</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.589" end="01:09:34.339" style="s2">because if there&#39;s anything that</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.240" end="01:09:35.510" style="s2">symbolic its language for sure right</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.339" end="01:09:37.370" style="s2">well it&#39;s a collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.510" end="01:09:39.770" style="s2">I would like to entice somebody in</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.370" end="01:09:41.930" style="s2">because we know that to have deep</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.770" end="01:09:43.970" style="s2">learners unpack their knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.930" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">present it to us an understandable form</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.970" end="01:09:48.560" style="s2">is certainly a thing the deep learning</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:50.120" style="s2">community is interested in and language</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.560" end="01:09:52.819" style="s2">would be a great place to work because</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.120" end="01:09:54.530" style="s2">we have the results on zero shot so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.819" end="01:09:56.840" style="s2">know we have some working black boxes</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.530" end="01:09:58.820" style="s2">and we have a template for the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.840" end="01:10:01.130" style="s2">things to look for because however</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.820" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">incomplete it may be</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.130" end="01:10:06.410" style="s2">understanding of grammar and typology</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:09.740" style="s2">syntax morphology all these components</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.410" end="01:10:11.960" style="s2">is very rich and it&#39;s it&#39;s a good type</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.740" end="01:10:14.330" style="s2">of logical space that&#39;s a collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.960" end="01:10:16.040" style="s2">that we should be pursuing and I hope</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.330" end="01:10:18.380" style="s2">somebody is successful in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.040" end="01:10:20.300" style="s2">grabbing the interest of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.380" end="01:10:22.580" style="s2">are very much in demand on both sides of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.300" end="01:10:24.920" style="s2">this problem very very true one person I</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.580" end="01:10:26.870" style="s2">know working on Salamis Vectis very</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.920" end="01:10:29.690" style="s2">interesting guy who&#39;s looking at doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.870" end="01:10:31.700" style="s2">what he calls grammar induction so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.690" end="01:10:34.100" style="s2">theory is you take a big enough corpus</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.700" end="01:10:36.200" style="s2">of language in the wild and actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.100" end="01:10:38.270" style="s2">induce the grammar in a mechanical way</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.200" end="01:10:40.640" style="s2">he&#39;s not all the way there yet but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.270" end="01:10:42.350" style="s2">making some progress so he&#39;s a person to</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.640" end="01:10:44.390" style="s2">keep an eye on in that space we</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.350" end="01:10:46.130" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t reinvigorate that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.390" end="01:10:47.330" style="s2">and do a workshop at SFI on that</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.130" end="01:10:49.340" style="s2">question I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.330" end="01:10:51.290" style="s2">introduce you to Lennis and see if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.340" end="01:10:53.630" style="s2">guys kind of resonate enough in your</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.290" end="01:10:55.280" style="s2">approaches to maybe you can be the dyad</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.630" end="01:10:57.050" style="s2">that then turns into a workshop I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.280" end="01:10:58.670" style="s2">happy to do the organizational stuff a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.050" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">testify yeah terrific let&#39;s put that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.670" end="01:11:01.880" style="s2">together and keep tunneling in the loop</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.830" style="s2">too because I know he continues to want</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.880" end="01:11:05.420" style="s2">to do this ah that would be great let me</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.830" end="01:11:07.400" style="s2">ask you and a little bit less scientific</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.420" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">questions but more kind of pop questions</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.400" end="01:11:12.260" style="s2">about language and its origins is do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:14.420" style="s2">have a view or do you have any reason to</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.260" end="01:11:17.150" style="s2">have a view about when something like</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.420" end="01:11:18.890" style="s2">our full language came into existence I</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.150" end="01:11:20.420" style="s2">mean there&#39;s some theories that say hey</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.890" end="01:11:22.850" style="s2">we were speaking something pretty close</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.420" end="01:11:24.650" style="s2">to Chomsky in languages 300 thousand</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.850" end="01:11:27.200" style="s2">years ago and then other people say nah</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.650" end="01:11:29.390" style="s2">it was only 40,000 years ago and some</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.200" end="01:11:31.130" style="s2">people even say that it was only 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.390" end="01:11:33.470" style="s2">years ago do you have a dog in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.130" end="01:11:35.180" style="s2">fight no I&#39;m the tourist of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.470" end="01:11:35.570" style="s2">opinions kind of the same way that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.180" end="01:11:38.060" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.570" end="01:11:39.830" style="s2">I read the arguments given for each of</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.060" end="01:11:42.290" style="s2">them but I don&#39;t have anything to add</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.830" end="01:11:43.910" style="s2">that would give me a unique take if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.290" end="01:11:45.890" style="s2">had to pick one what would be your best</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.910" end="01:11:47.540" style="s2">guess I would go in the hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.890" end="01:11:50.120" style="s2">year ballpark in the sense that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.540" end="01:11:53.570" style="s2">seems to be when we get the modern form</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.120" end="01:11:56.240" style="s2">of Y chromosome and the already in place</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.570" end="01:11:59.750" style="s2">modern form of the mitochondrion there</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.240" end="01:12:02.930" style="s2">may be later changes in human genome</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.750" end="01:12:05.570" style="s2">that we don&#39;t easily see but I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.930" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">what would have changed overall brain</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.570" end="01:12:11.130" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:13.110" style="s2">much later than that the question of</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.130" end="01:12:16.040" style="s2">what is the cause of cultural modernity</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.110" end="01:12:18.990" style="s2">the apparent horizon at 40,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.040" end="01:12:20.970" style="s2">remains interesting and compelling I</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.990" end="01:12:23.220" style="s2">agree here&#39;s my contribution to this</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.970" end="01:12:25.710" style="s2">discussion as I say it has to be more</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.220" end="01:12:29.310" style="s2">than 65 thousand years ago and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.710" end="01:12:31.740" style="s2">why the Out of Africa migration that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.310" end="01:12:34.320" style="s2">the one from which almost all non</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.740" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">African people are descended happened</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.320" end="01:12:39.210" style="s2">about 65 thousand years ago and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:41.610" style="s2">almost no genetic backflow to Africa for</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.210" end="01:12:43.500" style="s2">a very long time and yet chomskyan</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.610" end="01:12:46.500" style="s2">language exists in both Africa and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.500" end="01:12:48.810" style="s2">outside Africa therefore the capability</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.500" end="01:12:50.610" style="s2">to have full language had to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.810" end="01:12:52.290" style="s2">existed sixty five thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.610" end="01:12:54.030" style="s2">yeah that sounds right to me I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.290" end="01:12:55.350" style="s2">that seems to be a pretty clean way to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.030" end="01:12:56.730" style="s2">look at anything else you want to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.350" end="01:12:58.740" style="s2">about language before we move on to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.730" end="01:13:00.690" style="s2">sustainability know nothing to know</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.740" end="01:13:02.100" style="s2">though okay that&#39;s cool now this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.690" end="01:13:04.110" style="s2">something that I don&#39;t know to what</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.100" end="01:13:05.610" style="s2">degree you&#39;ve made an academic study of</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.110" end="01:13:08.010" style="s2">it but you and I have talked about it in</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.610" end="01:13:10.140" style="s2">fact I recall when you invited Joel</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.010" end="01:13:12.090" style="s2">Salatin Joel Salatin who as it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.140" end="01:13:14.640" style="s2">is my neighbor and we now know real well</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.090" end="01:13:16.740" style="s2">Eric invited Joel Salatin to talk at an</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.640" end="01:13:19.260" style="s2">SFI event and then you and I talked</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.740" end="01:13:21.390" style="s2">quite a bit about that before and after</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.260" end="01:13:23.790" style="s2">and you clearly have a lot of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.390" end="01:13:25.380" style="s2">about the fact one that we&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.790" end="01:13:26.730" style="s2">we don&#39;t change our ways and two at</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.380" end="01:13:28.470" style="s2">least some thoughts on what that might</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.730" end="01:13:30.330" style="s2">mean so why don&#39;t you give us our</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.470" end="01:13:32.910" style="s2">thoughts on where we&#39;re at with respect</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.330" end="01:13:34.590" style="s2">to ecosystem sustainability and what are</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.910" end="01:13:36.810" style="s2">some of the roads we need to think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.590" end="01:13:38.850" style="s2">going down if we&#39;re gonna actually get</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.810" end="01:13:40.740" style="s2">there yeah the way I entered this</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.850" end="01:13:43.560" style="s2">conversation was through a collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.740" end="01:13:45.420" style="s2">of Agriculture and medicine people of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.560" end="01:13:48.030" style="s2">all kinds that they really are citizens</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.420" end="01:13:50.250" style="s2">in that some of them are researchers</p>

<p begin="01:13:57.060" end="01:14:03.560" style="s2">and the collaboration was formed around</p>

<p begin="01:15:23.010" end="01:15:26.430" style="s2">big and interconnected and there are</p>

<p begin="01:15:30.570" end="01:15:35.010" style="s2">has a lot of weight is that the problems</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.300" end="01:15:36.960" style="s2">were stuck on are complex and the only</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.010" end="01:15:38.790" style="s2">way you solve complex problems is by</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.960" end="01:15:41.820" style="s2">having a very deep local understanding</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.790" end="01:15:44.520" style="s2">that certainly is true and I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:56.100" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">have to coordinate on the large scale</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.540" end="01:16:06.240" style="s2">and a place where I don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:08.850" style="s2">has good solutions is how do we leverage</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.240" end="01:16:10.920" style="s2">that small scale complex understanding</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.850" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">how do we feedback to really support it</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.920" end="01:16:16.230" style="s2">how do we keep local farming on the land</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:17.090" style="s2">at a sophisticated level which it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.230" end="01:16:20.220" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.090" end="01:16:22.770" style="s2">by having it supports for it come from</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.220" end="01:16:26.010" style="s2">the big system but then how do we keep</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.770" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">the big system constrained by feeding</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.010" end="01:16:31.140" style="s2">from and using all of that locally</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:33.420" style="s2">acquired knowledge that&#39;s the big system</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.140" end="01:16:36.179" style="s2">problem and there are lots there lot</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.420" end="01:16:40.050" style="s2">some little movements that are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.179" end="01:16:42.630" style="s2">do this and you know great support them</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.050" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">in any way we can I don&#39;t see them in</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.630" end="01:16:47.850" style="s2">pinching on the big structures that have</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.360" end="01:16:49.800" style="s2">lock in on the industrial farming system</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.850" end="01:16:52.590" style="s2">and on the terrible waste and</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.660" end="01:16:57.449" style="s2">structural change has to happen or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.670" end="01:16:59.190" style="s2">really in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.449" end="01:17:02.010" style="s2">yeah the way I sometimes phrase it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.190" end="01:17:04.350" style="s2">probably the solutions are local but the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.010" end="01:17:06.810" style="s2">system has to close globally right</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.350" end="01:17:08.790" style="s2">either we run into the wall at 120 miles</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.810" end="01:17:12.330" style="s2">an hour and cook the planet and destroy</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.790" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">our soils or we don&#39;t and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.330" end="01:17:17.250" style="s2">we have a real bad collective action</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.360" end="01:17:19.560" style="s2">problem here we have to have behaviors</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.250" end="01:17:21.929" style="s2">locally that are correct but yet they</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.560" end="01:17:24.300" style="s2">have to add up and close algebraically</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.929" end="01:17:26.040" style="s2">arithmetic alii even at a global level a</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.300" end="01:17:27.719" style="s2">real conundrum this is right this goes</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.040" end="01:17:29.460" style="s2">back to where we open the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.719" end="01:17:33.179" style="s2">about herb Simon and systems thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.460" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">and Creek in the central dogma so in</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.179" end="01:17:37.199" style="s2">order to have hierarchical structure you</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:38.790" style="s2">need control systems and that means that</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.199" end="01:17:41.310" style="s2">the controller has to be able to make</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.790" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">the controlled do what it would not do</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.310" end="01:17:45.270" style="s2">on its own otherwise you don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">controller but that opens the problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.270" end="01:17:49.140" style="s2">that the controller is not immediately</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:51.690" style="s2">subject to feedbacks it can be wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.140" end="01:17:54.600" style="s2">it can give wrong instructions maybe for</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.690" end="01:17:57.150" style="s2">a long time so how do we leverage the</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.600" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">benefits of having control systems but</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.150" end="01:18:00.510" style="s2">keep them responsive enough that when</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:01.890" style="s2">they&#39;re giving the wrong instructions</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.510" end="01:18:04.260" style="s2">they can&#39;t continue to do it long enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.890" end="01:18:05.820" style="s2">to crash the system and we see that in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.260" end="01:18:08.070" style="s2">every level we see it in the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.820" end="01:18:10.230" style="s2">business and the theory of the firm we</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.070" end="01:18:12.090" style="s2">see it in the economy we see it in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.230" end="01:18:14.250" style="s2">problems of sustainability of social</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.090" end="01:18:16.530" style="s2">order we see it in the question of what</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.250" end="01:18:19.530" style="s2">is democracy and what is required what</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.530" end="01:18:21.420" style="s2">is the aspiration of democracy what form</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.530" end="01:18:23.610" style="s2">would fulfill it and what do we need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.420" end="01:18:25.679" style="s2">maintain it which is sort of a problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.610" end="01:18:28.140" style="s2">of major urgency around the world right</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:30.690" style="s2">now so I think there&#39;s a meta question</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.140" end="01:18:32.580" style="s2">at the system&#39;s level what is the common</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.690" end="01:18:34.770" style="s2">thing that we are failing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.580" end="01:18:37.590" style="s2">in all of these questions and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.770" end="01:18:39.600" style="s2">how can we do better in bringing ideas</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.590" end="01:18:43.380" style="s2">to that problem yeah it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.600" end="01:18:45.090" style="s2">it&#39;s how do we create hierarchical or at</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.380" end="01:18:46.920" style="s2">least emergent entities that have</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.090" end="01:18:47.280" style="s2">multiple levels it may not be formally</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.920" end="01:18:49.110" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.280" end="01:18:52.080" style="s2">charcoal that nonetheless cohere</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.110" end="01:18:54.690" style="s2">together in real time and we have an</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.080" end="01:18:57.570" style="s2">example of that in the human body right</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.690" end="01:18:59.970" style="s2">we have billions of autonomous agents</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.570" end="01:19:01.860" style="s2">called ourselves right that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.970" end="01:19:03.810" style="s2">least originally free-floating single</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.860" end="01:19:05.660" style="s2">cells way back yonder and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.810" end="01:19:08.550" style="s2">time and yet we have this astounding</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.660" end="01:19:12.060" style="s2">homeostasis binds them all together in</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.550" end="01:19:14.460" style="s2">exchange of gases both bad gas out good</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.060" end="01:19:17.280" style="s2">gas in nutrients and toxins in this</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.460" end="01:19:19.860" style="s2">astounding modulated by a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.280" end="01:19:23.160" style="s2">system and it seems to me that our world</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.860" end="01:19:25.050" style="s2">system needs to learn from that and be</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.160" end="01:19:27.510" style="s2">able to hold itself together coherently</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.050" end="01:19:29.970" style="s2">in approximately real time despite</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.510" end="01:19:32.850" style="s2">operating on multi scale simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.970" end="01:19:34.710" style="s2">yes yeah you know transition from single</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.850" end="01:19:36.900" style="s2">cells to multi cells who it went through</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.710" end="01:19:38.280" style="s2">and what innovations were needed is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.900" end="01:19:40.650" style="s2">topic that a lot of people are looking</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.280" end="01:19:42.540" style="s2">at these days and it&#39;s a wonderful area</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.650" end="01:19:44.220" style="s2">it&#39;ll be interesting to see what we</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.540" end="01:19:45.930" style="s2">learn about the nature of regulation</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.220" end="01:19:47.400" style="s2">from trying to understand that better</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.930" end="01:19:49.770" style="s2">yeah unfortunately we don&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.400" end="01:19:51.540" style="s2">of time it&#39;ll have time for it probably</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.770" end="01:19:53.340" style="s2">for the answer to come from that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.540" end="01:19:56.220" style="s2">basic science seems to me that if we</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.340" end="01:19:58.020" style="s2">don&#39;t reform our ways advanced modern</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.220" end="01:20:00.690" style="s2">society is gonna run into the wall</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.020" end="01:20:02.610" style="s2">probably no later than 2100 so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.690" end="01:20:04.440" style="s2">to essentially innovate at higher levels</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.610" end="01:20:05.970" style="s2">of abstraction I&#39;m afraid rather than</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.440" end="01:20:07.830" style="s2">wait for answers from lower-level</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.970" end="01:20:09.120" style="s2">research yeah that seems right to me too</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.830" end="01:20:11.610" style="s2">have you given any thought at all to</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.120" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">what kind of signalling modalities what</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.610" end="01:20:15.330" style="s2">kind of control systems what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.440" end="01:20:17.130" style="s2">governance might be appropriate in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.330" end="01:20:18.990" style="s2">new world let&#39;s call it we gotta get it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.130" end="01:20:21.420" style="s2">in place by 2050 kind of timeframe</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.990" end="01:20:23.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a book I think by Paul Hawken</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.420" end="01:20:26.010" style="s2">called Blessed unrest and he has a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.880" end="01:20:29.820" style="s2">database behind it or did a few years</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.010" end="01:20:32.700" style="s2">ago which is an attempt to collect all</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.820" end="01:20:36.090" style="s2">of the civil society organizations that</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.700" end="01:20:37.620" style="s2">he could learn about and put them in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.090" end="01:20:40.650" style="s2">place where they can find each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.620" end="01:20:43.920" style="s2">we need a better theory of governance we</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.650" end="01:20:46.980" style="s2">can see governance being hollowed out by</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.920" end="01:20:48.600" style="s2">the sort of takeover of concentrated</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.980" end="01:20:51.510" style="s2">interests that are coming from private</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.600" end="01:20:53.730" style="s2">organizations at this time so government</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.510" end="01:20:55.810" style="s2">has a separate</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.730" end="01:20:59.110" style="s2">representation and organization in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.810" end="01:21:01.990" style="s2">society away from business or wealthy</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.110" end="01:21:03.490" style="s2">individuals or land that is being</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.990" end="01:21:07.240" style="s2">weakened and that needs to be brought</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.490" end="01:21:09.910" style="s2">back but presumably civil society is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.240" end="01:21:12.640" style="s2">other pillar which is the smaller and</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.910" end="01:21:15.190" style="s2">more disaggregated cousin to government</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.640" end="01:21:17.890" style="s2">and I feel like the right conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.190" end="01:21:20.080" style="s2">is going back to the conversation from</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.890" end="01:21:22.120" style="s2">Adam Smith&#39;s time but in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.080" end="01:21:23.260" style="s2">institutional world of today rather than</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.120" end="01:21:25.780" style="s2">the one that he lived in</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.260" end="01:21:27.700" style="s2">we have firms we have markets we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.780" end="01:21:29.980" style="s2">wealth concentrating mechanisms and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.700" end="01:21:31.630" style="s2">have private ownership we for good or</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.980" end="01:21:33.700" style="s2">for ill are going to have massive</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.630" end="01:21:37.750" style="s2">information gathering and control</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.700" end="01:21:41.070" style="s2">mechanisms we have civil society and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.750" end="01:21:43.660" style="s2">have government what is the most stable</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.070" end="01:21:47.320" style="s2">ecosystem of those components that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.660" end="01:21:48.550" style="s2">can foresee and try to design that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.320" end="01:21:50.470" style="s2">way I would put the sort of big picture</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.550" end="01:21:52.330" style="s2">question yeah actually I&#39;m putting a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.470" end="01:21:54.610" style="s2">of my efforts right now what I call the</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.330" end="01:21:57.400" style="s2">mezzo scale it used to be that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.610" end="01:21:59.380" style="s2">what made our lives both doable and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.400" end="01:22:01.630" style="s2">pleasant was from either the family or</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.380" end="01:22:03.670" style="s2">the local face-to-face community but</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.630" end="01:22:05.110" style="s2">over the last two hundred years most of</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.670" end="01:22:07.420" style="s2">that has been ceded to either the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.110" end="01:22:08.710" style="s2">governments or the markets and it seems</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.420" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">to me we need to find a way to</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.710" end="01:22:14.350" style="s2">revitalize a mezzo scale on the order of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:16.000" style="s2">hundreds and a few thousand people some</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.350" end="01:22:17.590" style="s2">people call that civil society but it</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.000" end="01:22:19.930" style="s2">may actually have more structure to it</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.590" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">than unstructured civil society any</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.930" end="01:22:23.920" style="s2">thoughts on whether that&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:25.660" style="s2">scale to be prospecting on my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.920" end="01:22:27.490" style="s2">are that I agree with your sensibility</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.660" end="01:22:29.560" style="s2">but I also think this is where you ought</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.490" end="01:22:33.100" style="s2">to have a good China Scholar in place</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.560" end="01:22:34.390" style="s2">because if I understand correctly some</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.100" end="01:22:37.210" style="s2">of the things that are guiding Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.390" end="01:22:39.730" style="s2">governance right now are kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.210" end="01:22:41.320" style="s2">distrust in the controllability of that</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.730" end="01:22:42.970" style="s2">meso scale which is why they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.320" end="01:22:45.910" style="s2">to weaken that and replace it with</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.970" end="01:22:47.320" style="s2">centralized control it would be really</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.910" end="01:22:50.140" style="s2">interesting to have somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.320" end="01:22:52.660" style="s2">informed and sophisticated in where that</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.140" end="01:22:55.120" style="s2">line of thought comes from on this</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.660" end="01:22:57.100" style="s2">conversation and say why do they</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.120" end="01:22:59.440" style="s2">distrust it to what extent do they</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.100" end="01:23:00.910" style="s2">mistrust it why do they think they can</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.440" end="01:23:03.760" style="s2">live without it if that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.910" end="01:23:06.909" style="s2">think what do they think can replace it</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.760" end="01:23:09.280" style="s2">and sort of what&#39;s the merit of our</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.909" end="01:23:11.320" style="s2">from the evidence we have about what</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.280" end="01:23:13.270" style="s2">problems can be solved by institutions</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.320" end="01:23:15.130" style="s2">at each of these scales I would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.270" end="01:23:16.750" style="s2">really interested to listen to informed</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.130" end="01:23:18.340" style="s2">people have that conversation do you</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.750" end="01:23:20.380" style="s2">have any pointers to people who are</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.340" end="01:23:24.040" style="s2">thinking in this space well there was a</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.380" end="01:23:27.010" style="s2">frontline documentary on AI in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.040" end="01:23:28.510" style="s2">context of Chinese governance today we</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.010" end="01:23:30.670" style="s2">could look to people on there and we</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.510" end="01:23:32.380" style="s2">could start in that as a network of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.670" end="01:23:34.420" style="s2">exploration with some of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.380" end="01:23:35.710" style="s2">appeared in that show either they</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.420" end="01:23:37.150" style="s2">themselves or people they would</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.710" end="01:23:38.860" style="s2">recommend that&#39;s where I would start</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.150" end="01:23:40.330" style="s2">because I&#39;m kind of new to this all</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.860" end="01:23:41.800" style="s2">right that&#39;s great I&#39;m gonna go mine</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.330" end="01:23:43.090" style="s2">that I&#39;ll let you know what I find out</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.800" end="01:23:44.920" style="s2">well we&#39;re getting close to the end of</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.090" end="01:23:46.870" style="s2">our time here this has been as I knew it</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.920" end="01:23:48.850" style="s2">would an unbelievably deep and</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.870" end="01:23:51.250" style="s2">interesting set of conversations about a</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.850" end="01:23:53.170" style="s2">wider range of topics and one could ever</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.250" end="01:23:55.000" style="s2">imagine any one person having in their</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.170" end="01:23:56.830" style="s2">head but before we go could you tell us</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.000" end="01:23:59.290" style="s2">what you&#39;re working on now and what you</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.830" end="01:24:01.510" style="s2">might be working on yeah the work</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.290" end="01:24:04.360" style="s2">continues to be sort of at the interface</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.510" end="01:24:07.929" style="s2">of organized geochemistry and the deep</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.360" end="01:24:10.870" style="s2">origins of biology I&#39;m getting more into</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.929" end="01:24:12.699" style="s2">the domain of folding and the origin of</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.870" end="01:24:14.350" style="s2">biopolymers than I used to because I</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.699" end="01:24:15.639" style="s2">have collaborators at Georgia Tech or</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.350" end="01:24:18.550" style="s2">some of the world experts in that</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.639" end="01:24:21.400" style="s2">problem we are looking again at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.550" end="01:24:23.650" style="s2">genetic code and that&#39;s where some my</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.400" end="01:24:25.300" style="s2">earlier comments when that came from but</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.650" end="01:24:27.790" style="s2">I should say that there&#39;s a a meta</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.300" end="01:24:29.350" style="s2">question that to me is the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.790" end="01:24:33.310" style="s2">question that reps many of these others</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.350" end="01:24:35.320" style="s2">together we often think about biology in</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.310" end="01:24:38.290" style="s2">terms of its extraordinary capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.320" end="01:24:40.540" style="s2">carry information and that capacity only</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.290" end="01:24:43.420" style="s2">exists because biology creates big</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.540" end="01:24:45.010" style="s2">combinatorial state spaces that in</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.420" end="01:24:47.320" style="s2">physics terms we would say are</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.010" end="01:24:49.210" style="s2">relatively flat so there can be big</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.320" end="01:24:51.489" style="s2">genomes where any sequence is really</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.210" end="01:24:54.010" style="s2">available the substrate of the material</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.489" end="01:24:56.320" style="s2">gene doesn&#39;t fight you from making one</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.010" end="01:24:58.120" style="s2">sequence versus another and that means</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.320" end="01:25:00.429" style="s2">that relatively weak forces like</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.120" end="01:25:01.989" style="s2">selection at the individual level can</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.429" end="01:25:04.600" style="s2">cause you to migrate around in that</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.989" end="01:25:07.659" style="s2">genome space and there is a similar</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.600" end="01:25:09.040" style="s2">story to be told for protein catalysts</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.659" end="01:25:10.540" style="s2">where you can kind of make any sequence</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.040" end="01:25:12.940" style="s2">and you can fold lots of them and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.540" end="01:25:15.130" style="s2">can catalyze with lots of them but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.940" end="01:25:18.010" style="s2">think if you&#39;re a physicist and you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.130" end="01:25:20.650" style="s2">how heterogeneous chemistry is you would</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.010" end="01:25:23.290" style="s2">say that these large combatant</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.650" end="01:25:27.040" style="s2">spaces that are physically neutral are</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.290" end="01:25:29.020" style="s2">not typical in a chemical system the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.040" end="01:25:31.390" style="s2">typical thing in the chemical system is</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.020" end="01:25:34.330" style="s2">for configurational heterogeneity to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.390" end="01:25:36.490" style="s2">so big that it just wipes out any kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.330" end="01:25:38.170" style="s2">of combinatorial flatness so if we want</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.490" end="01:25:40.810" style="s2">to understand why biospheres are</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.170" end="01:25:43.630" style="s2">possible we need to understand where</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.810" end="01:25:45.700" style="s2">there are sort of linchpin steps they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.630" end="01:25:48.280" style="s2">not combinatorial in themselves they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.700" end="01:25:50.740" style="s2">often small chemical problems but they</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.280" end="01:25:53.020" style="s2">create narrow bottlenecks anneal those</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.740" end="01:25:55.120" style="s2">bottlenecks reject enough of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.020" end="01:25:57.490" style="s2">configuration entropy of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.120" end="01:25:59.890" style="s2">that the stuff that gets through the</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.490" end="01:26:03.700" style="s2">bottleneck then becomes a combinatorial</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.890" end="01:26:05.860" style="s2">e large and flat space that&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.700" end="01:26:07.420" style="s2">carrying information so that was</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.860" end="01:26:10.150" style="s2">probably a little bit technically higher</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.420" end="01:26:13.240" style="s2">level than you want for your podcast but</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.150" end="01:26:16.630" style="s2">the the sort of soundbite compression of</p>
