<p begin="00:00:00.040" end="00:00:00.640" style="s2">Hi there.</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.720" end="00:00:03.380" style="s2">It&#39;s only about a week before Christmas,</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.380" end="00:00:03.880" style="s2">*singing* &quot;Tis the season to be jolly and joyus! With a burst of pleasure we feel it alright. Fa la la! It&#39;s the season when the saints can employ us. To spread the news about peace and to keep love alive!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.880" end="00:00:09.880" style="s2">and some of you are no doubt scrambling to determine what might make an appropriate Christmas gift.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.280" end="00:00:12.860" style="s2">As you may know, or also may not,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:17.680" style="s2">I have written a book that&#39;s coming out in January - on January 23rd as a matter of fact,</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:21.080" style="s2">called &quot;12 Rules for Life, An Antidote to Chaos&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.080" end="00:00:25.360" style="s2">And it&#39;s possible that some of the people you know might be interested in receiving that as a gift.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">However, a promise to get a book a month later doesn&#39;t make a great Christmas gift, exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.580" end="00:00:38.220" style="s2">So what I&#39;ve done is put together a small package that announces that the book has been ordered,</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.420" end="00:00:44.600" style="s2">that has a short letter in it from me and also that contains the introduction to the book;</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:47.240" style="s2">about 10 pages which I called &quot;Overture&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:53.480" style="s2">You could order the book online from any of the vendors to whom I have provided a link in the description of the video.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.480" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">And you could also download the package I have produced</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.880" end="00:01:03.580" style="s2">and print it out to make the gift more tangible and therefor more, well, solid and appreciated I would say.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.720" end="00:01:09.160" style="s2">And then you could put it in an envelope and you can give that little package as a gift.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.300" end="00:01:15.380" style="s2">And maybe that would be more appropriate than a mere indication that the book is on its way.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.380" end="00:01:22.820" style="s2">So, I hope that&#39;s useful. Thank you all for tuning in over the last year and before that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.900" end="00:01:25.640" style="s2">And for all the support you&#39;ve offered me in the last year.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">And Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.780" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">&quot;Tis the season to be jolly and joyous.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:34.700" style="s2">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.980" end="00:01:38.160" style="s2">&quot;With a burst of pleasure, we feel it all right.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:39.100" style="s2">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">&quot;It&#39;s the season when the saints can employ us.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.160" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">&quot;Fa la la!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">&quot;To spread the news about peace and to keep love alive...&quot;</p>
