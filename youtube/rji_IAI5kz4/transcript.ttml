<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">jeopardy fired by jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">all right all right okay uh obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">should start with 42</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">yes and your turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">well played you got nothing i got</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">zero it was a bluff yeah i guess okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">we will start with a few questions from</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">episode 48</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">and then a question from the discord and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">then move into your questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">last hour before moving into questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">this hour first question from a week ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">can you think of a reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">seemingly universal nature of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">pilgrimages</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">across time and cultures</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">sure yep um yeah i mean i can think of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">uh there&#39;s one in particular i&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">a good deal of time thinking about you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">and i both have</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">the uh pilgrimage of the wee troll</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">people in search of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">peyote they cross mexico to collect</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">peyote</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">uh once a year and in that case i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">that a the population</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">has likely moved over this distance</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">and so a pilgrimage that causes you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">return to some ancestral landscape</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">regularly a keeps you in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">the information about what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">intervening space</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">looks like that is to say it provides a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">regularly updated</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">map that is not just held by a select</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">few</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">right and um so that has</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">um a great deal of potential importance</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">just ecologically speaking maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">that kind of information in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">the we chole and the peyote obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">the peyote is playing a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">tremendous cultural role and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">a necessity to move</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">to another part of the world in order to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">do one&#39;s daily ecological stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">but to maintain contact with the peyote</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">cactus</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">would make sense but anyway i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">point would be there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">reasons a couple of styles of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.000" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">it could be that a journey that causes</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">you to return over some landscape</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">informs you about something that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">ecologically important to know</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">it could be that pilgrimages cause you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">to basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">touch base with something cultural from</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">which too much divergence is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">a danger and so that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">synchronizing aspect that to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">that you keep returning to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">location or return to some location at</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">one point and know that you will at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">point in your life</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">keeps you from dispensing with all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">the architecture that goes along with</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">that cultural tradition has so i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">say it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">spatial conservatism that has probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">preserved</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">populations against too much change</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">great yep i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">uh that&#39;s spot on and you know to which</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">i would just add the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">what i already said the universal value</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">of having an accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">regularly updating map of the area</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">around you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">perhaps just the area that historically</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">your people have lived</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">in or perhaps it&#39;s a area of a watershed</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">you know some some area presumably that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">will change over time is all due</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">some more rapidly than others that would</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">allow you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">to understand what an escape plan might</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">look like what a new kind of move might</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">and that is not um that is not static</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">yeah in terms of a map that was drawn 50</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">years ago and who knows what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">yeah and i guess i would add one more</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">thing um this came up</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">in my uh conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">with christine brophy and scott barry</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">kaufman on</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">unity campfire this week but there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">this sense amongst moderns that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">you are effectively entitled not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">suffer</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">not to struggle and that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">suffering and struggle</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">is taken to be some kind of a an</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">indication of a failure of something</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">and this is utter nonsense right</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">and suffering are inherent to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:45.360" style="s2">accomplishment and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">uh i i have a few rituals that i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">as toughening myself up you know things</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">that i know i find unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">and i do them and my sense is this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">me to be able to face things that i</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily see coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">so you can imagine that a population um</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">choosing a regular struggle um would</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">keep people</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">uh in that frame of mind and actually um</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">uh also fasting could certainly work</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">this way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">you know that a regular like an annual</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">fast uh would cause you to keep in touch</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">with what it&#39;s like to be hungry and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not the end of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">absolutely and and no um no coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">that some form of pilgrimage and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">form of fast exist in many religions</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">yes exactly adults born pre-term</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">have a pre-term behavioral phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">resulting in tippiness and neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">how does being born pre-term impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">other animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">so the first answer to that is i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">know what i&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">that we know because i&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">preterm is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">reliably enough a thing anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s been looked at yeah i would say in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">in general pre-term is going to mean not</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">viable</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">right and so you just you never get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">discovering what the behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">phenotype might look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">right on the other hand um runts</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">are a feature of litters and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">pre-term but it has some of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">characteristics and i would say the runt</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">is going to have uh neuroticism or</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">something like neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">and insecurity because basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">it is an evolutionary attempt</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">in it you know you can imagine if a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">pregnancy starts</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">and then the year turns out spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">than having produced an extra that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">that is denied resources in utero but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">brought to full size is an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">win</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">and so that individual should expect</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">that to the extent that it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">year that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">most likely to perish and maybe to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">abandoned by</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">by the parent and so um you would</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">imagine that neuroticism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">demonstrating strength and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">all of these things that might increase</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">the chances of surviving to adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">would be features of that personality</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">type yeah i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">demonstrating strength it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">would be a feature and yet it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve never heard this</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">pre-term behavioral phenotype term</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">um but timidness and eroticism um</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">strike me as not in in line with</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">demonstrating strength but we do see</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">in rents of litters and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">know humans humans don&#39;t bear litters</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">humans ten</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">the vast majority of human births are</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">singletons uh with twins being a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">small percentage and really more than</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">that um being almost entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">a manifestation of modern technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">please discuss voting as a right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">responsibility vote your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">what effect does not voting have uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">vote shaming topic is this next sentence</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure exactly what that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">love you guys but</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">i i like the the general topic here um</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">is it is it both a right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">well i want to be a little careful</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">because uh i think there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">in which it is irresponsibility and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">wish people took it as one but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">necessarily think</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">a uninformed vote is such a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">so to the extent that voting is your</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">responsibility you should figure out</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">what you should actually be voting for</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:26.639" style="s2">on the other hand so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">if i may uh it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.639" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">voting is there is the entirety of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">responsibility if you&#39;re going to vote</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">you should</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">it should be informed about informed</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">voting should be the responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">you understand yourself to have not</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">merely voting</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">yes but i want to put a giant asterisk</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">on that because</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">i thought that was the asterisk i want</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">to put an asterisk</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">on the asterisk yeah that does sound</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">like you yeah it does but</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">um the thing that we all face in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">voter pamphlets is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">almost impenetrable and you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">informed and who are these judges and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">you know um so the point is to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">extent that there is this temptation</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">to finger wag at people and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">you know those uninformed voters the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">point is well we set them up for failure</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">we set ourselves up for failure</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">and so ideally what you want is a system</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">that gives you the ability to vote on</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">that which you have the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">informed</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">about and delegates where it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">delegate to people who can handle the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">responsibility and of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">what we have is a giant you know corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">entity</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">that stands in place of all this and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">loves to hand us</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">confusing garbage and manipulate us into</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">feeling emotional about it and all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">things that it does</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">but ideally yes you would want people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">you know voting as a privilege and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">and um to treat it very</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">seriously now one thing i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a longer discussion for another</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">time about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">that if you take all of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">don&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">and you separate them into two groups</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">don&#39;t care they&#39;re apathetic they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">they don&#39;t see themselves as having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">stake yeah and then you take</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">you separate them from the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">are frustrated and angry that they never</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">have something</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">they feel good about voting for yep</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">that second group is very large</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">and if you compile them with all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">people who do vote for one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">party candidates</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:39.839" style="s2">there are enough votes in that group</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">to transform civilization and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.839" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">that we are told</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">well first of all we&#39;re fine with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">not voting basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to give you an awful</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">situation and drive you out and people</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">are going to feel good about not voting</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">which in some sense it has become</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">that this causes a collective</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">failure of imagination that is the</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">same way so at some level</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">we have to rescue the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">protest vote from the concept that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">a pointless waste of your power because</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">in fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of power in voting for</p>

<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">other than the major party candidates if</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">it registers somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">the system you know doesn&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">count those votes because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">want there to be power in it it fears</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">that those who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">angry and disaffected will actually rise</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">up against the system and insist on</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">and so what it does is it falsely</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">convinces us</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">that we have no power the only thing we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">can do is choose between</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">evils and if we choose to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">else that&#39;s because we&#39;re naive children</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">who have decided to waste our vote it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">nonsense it&#39;s not a waste of a vote</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful thing now</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">i think of myself at the point you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">what do i know i&#39;ve already lost this</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">i know that my candidate won&#39;t win</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">because my candidate is not running</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not on the ballot right so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">already lost this one</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">does that mean there&#39;s nothing to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">done no i&#39;m voting</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">in the next election right i&#39;m voting in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">in the next election by registering the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">that i don&#39;t accept this lesser evil</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">garbage</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what that means i&#39;m voting</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">in 2020 in the next election i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">know what that sentence means</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">it means that by voting against the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">one registers that there is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">political movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">waiting to be spoken to and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">that that signal is power it is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">power to change things in 2020 but it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">power to change things in the future so</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">if you think about elections</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">you know we are basically convinced to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">think of elections in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">right but it is obviously an iterated</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">game and if this you know if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">analyze them if you were an alien coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">to earth to analyze our elections</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t sit down and think of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">as one-off puzzles you would think of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">them as iterated</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">yep and that affects the game theory so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">think of elections as iterated</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">and it changes what you ought to do no</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually part of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">lesser of two evils argument is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">assumes that you&#39;re always an end game</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">yeah it assumes that you&#39;re always an</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">endgame if you don&#39;t do it now</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">everything will end yep absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">actually the next question the final</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">question from episode 48 is related to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">that last one</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">why does being demanded to vote by</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">celebrities and the media feel like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve always had a strange feeling about</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">i voted stickers</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">and comments like if you don&#39;t vote you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">can&#39;t complain</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">so i feel like we kind of we kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">kind of touched on this but</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">pick up a little bit more well i would i</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">would add one thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">i do think you should vote so that it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">not ambiguous as to whether you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">apathetic or disaffected</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">if you are disaffected you want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">register as disaffected</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">and not as a non-participant right</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">and the way to do that is to vote so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s clear you&#39;re willing to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">effort and frankly it&#39;s not a huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">effort</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">right but you want to register as</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">willing to spend the effort</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">and not up for this [ __ ] right</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the powerful</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">move and so you know i do think if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">didn&#39;t do that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">makes it ambiguous as to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">you have a right to complain uh to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">complain because you might be apathetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">and if you&#39;re apathetic or lazy then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">point is actually it does reduce your</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">right to complain so</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">i sort of believe it now celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">you know unfortunately this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">evolutionary it&#39;s propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">it is propaganda and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">novelty problem the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">because we are exposed to celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.120" style="s2">and we recognize them it sort of feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">like they&#39;re people in our little town</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.120" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;re not yeah right um so</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">my good friend the person i&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">meet tells me i need to vote okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">right exactly yeah exactly</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">vote on which one they want us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">address each week</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">what would be the best steps towards</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">functional level of employment readiness</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">in graduates</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">is there a way we can reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">perceived necessity of higher education</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">and if completeness be restored to a</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">higher education seems off the mark</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">uh teach i i agree teaching towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">higher ed seems off the mark and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">know this</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">there are there&#39;s the school that we met</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">at in high school</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">um and as a as like many other</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">elite private schools are called college</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">prep college preparatory</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that is clearly what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">is that they are doing and yet actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">the school where we met did far far far</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">more than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">and i would say that it did not it also</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">did not make the mistake of what i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">intrinsic to this question which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">employment readiness this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">that we hear from most people who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">saying look the liberal arts have gone</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">off the rails</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not what we need we need to know</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">be ready</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">um to enter the workforce and be</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">and that was more true</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">20 50 and 100 years ago than it is now</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">and even when it was more true because</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">the future then was more predictable and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">looked more like the immediate past</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">it was still not the highest and best</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">the highest and best goal of education</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">helping people realize their full</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">potential so they can live</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">as maximally productive however you</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">and creative and content</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">i guess citizens of the society in which</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">and so that that that liberal arts</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">uh it&#39;s about thinking um can live side</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">by side</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">can exist side by side with the more</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">sort of trades-oriented goals of of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">the the additional problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">training goal right now is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what the future looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what employment looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what jobs look like</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">are going to look like and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">especially current educators are going</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">to be able to train kids</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">for tomorrow&#39;s jobs is laughable</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">i would say yeah it&#39;s laughable on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">other hand i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">today&#39;s educators are well positioned to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">do either job</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">no they&#39;re not um and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">tragedy so</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">i i do think that there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">haunts this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">which is that the choice</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a dichotomy which is false</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">that we could teach for so in other</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:54.559" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this well you know maybe overly</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">um simplistic or idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">idea of you know empowering you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">see the full glory of the human</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">experience right the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">liberal arts thing which you know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">you&#39;re in a position to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">is a great thing if it&#39;s done well which</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">it generally isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">um and it won&#39;t be everyone&#39;s cup of tea</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">or um nor will everyone be in a position</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">they can afford to spend time there well</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">i i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">if it was done well it would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">everybody&#39;s cup of tea because what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">would really be doing is giving you the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">higher order tools in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">figure out what the special puzzles</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">we&#39;re going to play games we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">engage in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">in in sport with an academic bench yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">if what it did was make you um</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">really smart and aware</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">and motivated self-motivated such that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">you could do what you set your mind to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">right then the point is yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">everybody&#39;s cup of tea if you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">in general we don&#39;t think we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">because by the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">students get to a place where it might</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">be done uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">they&#39;re too damaged in general for it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">be done and the teachers just</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t in a position to deliver it less</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.440" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">and less so in some sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">less and less so in part because</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">teaching now like policing has become</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">less and less of a vaunted</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">profession and so people going into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">are less likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">sort of the best at what they do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">said there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">many many many awesome teachers out</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">there who are just hamstrung</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">yes by and you know this is the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">problem i think then that a lot you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">that there are no teachers who can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">the job like no there are plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">teachers who can do the job but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">being prevented from doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">the job precisely because well in part</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">um the teaching towards the test the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">number of days the number of hours in</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">any given school year that devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">prep test prep or test taking and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">the test for the test is about college</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">prep</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">so um you know that&#39;s that doesn&#39;t serve</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">anyone like if if those teachers were</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">allowed</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">to actually teach and uh if the good</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">teachers were allowed some freedom</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">to actually do what they could do then</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">then we might have a better educational</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">i know i&#39;m not really disagreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">you but i do disagree that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">lots of good teachers</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">and in part there aren&#39;t lots of good</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">teachers because</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">the system doesn&#39;t provide enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">freedom if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">a good teacher that means that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">you have effectively been armed with</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">this mindset and then you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.080" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">absolutely bridle against the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">requirements that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">put in your way and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">by massively underpaying so that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">don&#39;t you know reward those who might</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">have a passion for it</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">and then hamstringing teachers basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">driven the talent out and that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">say that there are no good teachers left</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">there are but</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">um it is the exception not the rule</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:02.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s people who have to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">all of these immunities and ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.559" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">see past these stupid structures</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">in order to do anything that feels</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">and i think frankly it&#39;s getting harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">and harder so yeah no it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">getting harder and harder i would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not just the money</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s easy to say and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">believe it to be true</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">and in fact i said the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">well that we don&#39;t you know we don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">enough and that makes it harder to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">attract the best and the brightest</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">that said back when back when we were at</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">evergreen and i was</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">um i was the faculty represented ran a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">faculty representative for the council</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">the idea it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">work out that way um but at one point</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">early on</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">we ended up with uh basically pay sheets</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">and there were</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">representatives from university of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">washington and washington state</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">in the state of washington that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">public uh as opposed to western central</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">eastern and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">and evergreen um which are masters level</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">institutions i think still and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">the pay for faculty at uw and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">at uh washington state and indeed at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">other three</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">um was all sort of as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">expect for faculty and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">somehow were complaining you know there</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">was a legitimate complaint about</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">how low high school teachers pay was</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">because the idea was that if we get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">pipeline better we&#39;d be getting better</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">college students in</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">and when i looked at these numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">what high school teachers were being</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">paid in most parts of the state</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">they were higher than what evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">faculty were being paid</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.600" style="s2">so you know evergreen was famously</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">terrible at paying its faculty right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">this was actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">this was after our pay had climbed a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.559" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">little bit but was still just quite low</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">and yet um what we used to say and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">think you innovated this was we got paid</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">in freedom</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">um so yeah we we made plenty to and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">it was cheap to live in olympia so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">you know we made plenty to live to live</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">nicely but you couldn&#39;t really move</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">on that pay um on on either the coasts</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">and buy a house with the kind of money</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">that we were making for most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">that we were there</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">what we had making less than most high</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">school teachers in the state</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t have almost any of was</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">the freedom to make the decision</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">decisions to think about what we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">to teach what we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">take students where we wanted to all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">these things and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">increasingly the public k-12 system has</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">gives basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">no freedom at all to its teachers so i</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know how you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">even tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">if there are how many good teachers</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">there are left in the system at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">like i can i can say we can speak for</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">about what we actually think about uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">the faculty at evergreen and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">snide comments in the past and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">not what we&#39;re going to do here now</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">because we really know because there was</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">so much freedom that people revealed</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">with what they did and mostly did not do</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">but how would you even tell with regard</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">to the teachers given how</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">constrained they are by all of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">by all of the especially testing</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">protocols that are being handed them</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">well i mean a there&#39;s a sort of stance</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">to reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">criteria if the job pays like crap and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">passion for it but you&#39;re unable to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">deploy that passion because of all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">rules you go do something else yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">also hope that just</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">sort of matches the you know experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">and you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">meet occasionally these subversive</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">teachers who are figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">teach</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">in spite of the rules right um in public</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">yeah in the public schools but um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">i think the answer is just evident so</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">one last thing i want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">the problem is as soon as you get away</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">from a pure liberal arts bent the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">is oh you&#39;re teaching for employers</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">right you&#39;re teaching to what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">employers want there is another category</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">right we could arm you to be good at</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">to be good at thinking to be good at</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">problem solving which means hey</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">you might become an employer we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">trying to please employers we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">to make employers so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">well this is i mean this is what you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">i used to talk about and and teach about</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">actually and present</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">to evergreen people when they would</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">listen when we were still there was</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">we need you know we need a reframing of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">the liberal arts um that does not</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">simply inherit inherit the readings and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">the philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">of a hundred years ago yeah but actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">imagines what it would be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">to be an informed and self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">citizen of the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">yeah and i would add self-motivated</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">do the worst possible job on this front</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">and it means that everybody is waiting</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">for somebody to tell them what to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s a disaster predictably</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">absolutely we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">build self-motivated problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">people which frankly will be happier</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">more effective uh more economically</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">productive people too</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">absolutely hey let&#39;s do that let&#39;s do</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">your people and figuring out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">your people to wake up to the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">nonsense and that it is serving to keep</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">uh but if they can then the point is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a game which is how do you reach</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:08.720" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s difficult to reach what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.720" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">that will cause them to think twice</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">about something they thought they had</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">they had nailed and uh</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">just they can&#39;t hear what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m going to argue</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">john mcwhorter yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">know i mean he&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">done plenty of stuff that you can find</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">um let&#39;s see but i mean the coddling of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">the american</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">mind titan looking on us book from two</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">um and the righteous mind i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">that would be you know anything again</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">that though the righteous mind is sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">of modern context-free just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">sulcinitzen</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">and uh you know and heller and and havel</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about this particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">and i suspect that many people need</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">some particular like some of the context</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">of the particular moment to begin</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">to crack the facade that presumably</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">msnbc is</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">is providing yeah but if you let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">um you read righteous mind and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">what height is doing in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">modern stuff right it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">dismiss him</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">right he&#39;s very very careful very well</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">grounded and i think quite hearable</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">and so you know it unfortunately may be</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">too much homework</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a lot of work but uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">but anyway i think i think it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">potentially a way in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">what&#39;s next do you guys think that it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">possible that the pre-existing medical</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">conditions hit hardest by covid</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">are because the tissue that was used in</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">the gain of function research was tissue</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">from humans with these conditions</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting question i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">it is well within the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">possibility that we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">carefully about what the features are of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">the disease</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">that would have come from uh these</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">serial passage experiments and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">tissues they may have been run in or</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">what creatures they may have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">running and it may have been both</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">so whether these pre-existing conditions</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">you know if you had</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">tumor tissue for example that tumors are</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">on are very poorly epigenetically</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">regulated</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">and that could be causing the very</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">eclectic nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">disease yeah you know that it invades</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">lots of different kinds of tissue</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">um so something like that is possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">whether the individual&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">the very particular pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">i would say it is more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got an unregulated tissue or a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">poorly regulated tissue that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">simulates some of those conditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">rather than the patient that the tissue</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">came from had them</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">yeah i would um</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">i would tend to agree and i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">have a good enough sense of how the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">inner</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">function research is run um to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">to have a lot of insight here but my</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">sentence like if this</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">if the lab original hypothesis is true</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">and it was gain of function research</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">that was happening in chinese labs</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">um then to my mind one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">places i go to when i see this question</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">as well one of the main pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">medical conditions that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">correlated with bad outcomes in covid is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">obesity</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">and my sense is that there is far less</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">obesity</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">in the chinese population than for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">instance in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">western populations in the west</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">um and you know why yeah well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">struggling to think whether there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">reason to think that they would have</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.040" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">used</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">tissue from chinese people well this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">well so i mean it&#39;s in chinese lab so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">where are they getting oh they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">this is just some</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">international source of tissue guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">would be that because</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">you know for valid reasons because you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">want work to be comparable between</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">labs that probably there&#39;s some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">some equivalent of the jack&#39;s lab for</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">human tissue right which</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">could be a vulnerability just as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">jack&#39;s lab is a vulnerability but i</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">yep could also be okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">you know yes it is possible either way</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">people who are deeply ensconced in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">kind of work know the answer off the top</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">of their head but i</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">brett claims a great amount of liberal</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">we decided wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">the public intellectuals i think are far</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">quieter</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">and therefore basically misrepresent</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">what the rest of the people on</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">you know among the liberals who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">given voice because they don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">in you know on op-ed&#39;s pages of papers</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">are actually thinking so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">and me being certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">that there is a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">people it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">that it is the silent majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">on the left who actually are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">scans at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">and you know maybe going along because</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel that dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">or actually beginning to get really</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">antsy about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s a really large number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">people is not the same thing as arguing</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">that it is a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">public voices on the left and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a large</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">number of public voices on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not a large enough number</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">of public voices on the left</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">who are criticizing this on the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">hand so what we did say</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">when we were talking about this last</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">hour was in part</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">when you do start talking about it um</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">you get told you&#39;re on the left and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">get to shut up and you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">platform and you know you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">um that people say about cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">and such are</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">are true uh and so you know that it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">is exactly pushing people into silence</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">when they might not</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">otherwise be silent yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">i want to be a little bit careful the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a majority that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">are just keeping their mouth shut</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">i think people start out knowing better</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">and then they take a step on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">slippery slope and then they convince</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">themselves of this woke nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">um out of self out of an instinct to</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">self present i don&#39;t know what those</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">numbers look like i hope it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">majority</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">but i want to be really sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">pushback here</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">is clean because there was something</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">very bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">about that opinion piece</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">okay okay it literally said you and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">found the same quote and we didn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">about it okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">yeah right where are the liberal voices</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">pushing back we find conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">pushing back</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">where are the liberals right this was</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">written by somebody</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">editorial page could have said well</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">there are some in fact here are several</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">articles that we&#39;ve published</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">clearly would be the page would be aware</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">have expected the page in the editorial</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">process to say actually it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not that bleak right which would</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">have then resulted in a change in that</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">following us so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">how can somebody who is aware of all of</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">we&#39;re liberals this doesn&#39;t track for us</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">could such a person write that sentence</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">and then how could the page</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">sign off on it it&#39;s just well it might</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">maybe we are reading it wrong maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">is to push people to speak up and say no</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">here we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">for god&#39;s sake this we we understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">that this is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">you know there there are a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">to get people to act</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">that are legitimate but not</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">straightforward yeah but this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">this is a newspaper and it&#39;s the wall</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">street journal and it&#39;s a wall street</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">the wall street journal which</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">was farsighted enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">let us write for them and not to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">know sanitize what we wrote so it looked</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">like it came from conservatives so</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">anyway something odd happened i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">think we&#39;re ever going to know what it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">but something odd happened and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have happened because at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">very least if you&#39;re going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">claim</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">there aren&#39;t enough liberals standing up</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">against this which is a fine claim</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">and the answer is there are some but why</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t there more</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">like these folks and then it raises a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">question well what has your experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">experiences i keep getting portrayed as</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">a conservative right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">yeah like so you know anyway something</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">else should have happened yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">next question i think the mostly</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">peaceful argument surrounding riots</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">riots has been debunked why does this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">not work as an argument for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">anti-racists</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">replacing it with society being mostly</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">non-racist</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">yeah so first oh go ahead well no um</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">um in part because um</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">the mostly peaceful stuff was sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">be it started to be on the water like it</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">was all of these media platforms who</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">were making this claim</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">and you know it depends on what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">by mostly it depends what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">peaceful and they all had these</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">different definitions all of which were</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">[ __ ] but they were all defending it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">through these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">um you know anything ranging from</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">dimwitted to nefarious means i would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">compare that to anti-racism is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">specific ideology</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">created by a very specific person</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">ibrahim x kendi</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">and it has a very precise definition</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">which is [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not this amorphous thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">know people who are saying well i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">anti-racist well then you&#39;re racist</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">candy says so and people don&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">to that by saying you know candy says so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">they may not even know that but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">is it does have this thing at base which</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">crazy it&#39;s crackpot it&#39;s nasty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">divisive it&#39;s racist all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">but it is a it is a is a real thing at</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">base that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">is yes the creation of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">fever dream of ibrahim x kendi but boy</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">he&#39;s winning with it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">and it does mean that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">you can go back to and point to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">yeah i mean i think in part there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">enough complexity</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">surrounding racism and enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">amorphousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t track as cleanly and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to know what role we</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">played in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">breaking free of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">you know mostly peaceful nonsense but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">before the mostly peaceful argument</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">broke into a thousand pieces uh we did a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">riff where we were talking about my back</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">of the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">calculations in which the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">motorcade</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">in dallas in 1963 was you know above 99</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">peaceful and so anyway it was the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">peaceful list</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:34.960" style="s2">so the point is there is a way to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to use this mostly</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.960" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">peaceful stuff to reveal</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">that it means nothing right what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">mostly peaceful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">well and i guess um also it also doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">if you yourself have not engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">protest at all it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">and if you&#39;ve only engaged in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">peaceful protest you know like during</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">daylight i don&#39;t really know what it</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">looks like in the other cities but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">know in in portland if it&#39;s during</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s during daytime they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">been actually peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">um and they&#39;re real legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">protesters out there um</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">you can just say without any worry that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">anyone is going to accuse you of having</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">been not peaceful accuse you of having</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">been violent like no that wasn&#39;t me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">not like i know that i participated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">a peaceful protest right whereas this at</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">threat of being accused of being racist</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">has become</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not the first person to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">this but it&#39;s like being accused of</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">being a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">child abuser like you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">this thing like no</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">no i&#39;m not oh my god i&#39;ll do anything at</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">all to avoid being called that</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">and so it is much more easily weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.680" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">um in part because of the fear of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">called it and that works in part because</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">it is a personal accusation</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">really good question it&#39;s a really good</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">i would say there&#39;s reason to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">about this um</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">that there are kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about you know but</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">it&#39;s role modeling right and no matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">no matter how awesome a role model i am</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">for our two children</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">things and habits that i have and to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">also learn from me and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">and not do things and develop habits</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">that i have</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">but in terms of how it is that they will</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">engage with the world as much as you and</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">i have shed</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">more of the gender stereotypes than</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">almost anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">i know you&#39;re their father and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">boys and they&#39;re becoming men</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">comforting to hear it is my claim that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">has been from the beginning i&#39;m sticking</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">all right putative father of those two</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">children um now you are their father</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.880" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">and and you are you are the model to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">which they are they um they should</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">aspire more closely</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">even though um even though there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">little about what we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">um that is at all um</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">sex uh typical no</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">sex mandated yeah yeah so that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just the you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:33.119" style="s2">gonna grow up to be men</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">you need to have a model for that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">you know a model of a relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">you know assuming you&#39;re straight</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a model of you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">what is a woman what is it likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">interact with one so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">stuff that needs to be modeled that said</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">yeah um you know i think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">conversation would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">missing something if it didn&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">the possibility i mean within</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">you know gay culture there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">variation around these</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">gender norms right and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">i think i think what i would say is my</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">personal suspicion is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">that there is not that having two</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">parents who love you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">and a world of examples from which to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">draw</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">is probably way</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">better than um</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">a huge swath of of hetero families</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">right yeah you know or one parent who</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">loves you but is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">stretched so thin by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">economic realities of the situation so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">you know i guess what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s probably some almost being</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">all else being equal there is liable to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">be something um</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">but you know but the ways we damage kids</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">are so many</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">that you know i don&#39;t see it as a big</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">factor relative to all you know to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">allowing advertisers to access your</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">children and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">reschedule how often they&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">right like that&#39;s a no</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">you could even argue that since you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">since gay couples</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">uh inherently have family by choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">they ne they never fell into being in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">relationship with their parents with</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">their child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">other parent and therefore ended up with</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">a family before they wanted to um that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">their greater intentionality may result</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">in greater preparedness and skill</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not i don&#39;t know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">true but i can see an argument in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">regard as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">yes if you&#39;re gay and in a committed</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">relationship it it&#39;s not likely you will</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">accidentally end up with children yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s what i just said that is</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">change uh healing rate and trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.559" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">is remarkable that was my sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.400" style="s2">next up this is a donation to test the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.400" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">by releasing helium from a tank from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">balloon store in the garage</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:35.680" style="s2">not too much boom side note oh so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">helium yeah not hydrogen i said helium</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.680" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">no but no boom i&#39;ve got that yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be a boom because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">helium i didn&#39;t say that that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">sideways in the question side note lots</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">of math squaring here greater than 95</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">but cases are rising fast parenthesis</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">uh so without knowing where you are or</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know my suspicion is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">as people begin spending more time</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">inside with windows closed we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">to get cases rising even if masks are</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">supposedly being worn because</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">masks are imperfect and even people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">are wearing masks sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">aren&#39;t um yes and in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:20.160" style="s2">upgraded model that we have we talked</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">about a couple live streams ago</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.160" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">about aerosolized transmission the masks</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">don&#39;t work if you&#39;re in an environment</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">that saturates</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">with these aerosolized particles because</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">a lot of stuff is going around them and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">basically you breathe it long enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">you&#39;ll get it so</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:37.200" style="s2">yeah paying attention to airflow airflow</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">and saturated environments uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.200" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">masks are good for transient exposures</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">if you walk into a room that&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">coveted you will reduce the likelihood</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">of contracting it yeah and big volume</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">spaces are better than small volume</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">spaces so here&#39;s a place where like</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">vaulted ceilings like you find in</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">grocery stores is actually going to make</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.839" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:58.640" style="s2">spaces probably safer if the hvac is</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.839" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">um doing anything useful at all yep um</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.640" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">as to the first part with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:05.760" style="s2">helium yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">the test of the hypothesis i probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.760" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">should have mentioned it would be to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">balloon helium at a party store and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">bag a camera and put some</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">helium in there and see if we reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">regular drop in signal yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">i haven&#39;t done it for a couple reasons</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:28.480" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">is can&#39;t find a party store i probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.480" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">could find a party store i have one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">these phones</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">from the future that tells you where</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">stuff like that is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">i know um but the other thing is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">takes time for the helium to diffuse</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">out of the mems chip and so you lose</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">access to your device until the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">device wakes back up a few days later</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m just sort of reluctant</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">to do it but yes i probably should do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">i probably should do it</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:55.280" style="s2">we should do it yeah we should do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">test and not you know doing it um in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.280" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">garage</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">you know might if that works on a camera</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:01.839" style="s2">it might make sense to do it in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">garage as a next step just to follow</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.839" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">through but i&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">i mean let&#39;s put it this way the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">prediction is that we will see the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">pattern of failure of the cameras with</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">the regular</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">uh dropped signal and i would say if</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:17.359" style="s2">that happens then the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:19.039" style="s2">it&#39;s helium that did it where did it</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.359" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">come from did it come from the smoke or</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.039" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">did it come from the geology and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">house being buttoned up that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:26.799" style="s2">next question yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">where can evolutionary principles be</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.799" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">applied outside of biology and where are</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:32.480" style="s2">they commonly applied when they</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:32.480" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.280" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">well i would say you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">a problem that comes from the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">we group the sciences together as if</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">right so we group biology with chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">and physics</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">that isn&#39;t correct grouping in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">that they are amenable to scientific</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:56.079" style="s2">but it is not a correct grouping in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">sense that biology has purpose</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.079" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">right uh ultimately maybe it doesn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">a biological creature behaves as if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">has purpose to increase fitness right</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">and the point is those realms in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">there is identifiable purpose</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">and complexity are properly analogized</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:15.359" style="s2">to biology</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">so that is to say psychology</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">engineering economics those are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">places where evolutionary dynamics are</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:25.039" style="s2">mirrored</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">and anthropology um everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.039" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">anything made of anything made of living</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.440" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">critters exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">all of you know anything that might be</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:32.160" style="s2">studied in the humanities or social</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">right on the other hand something like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">hurricane</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">has complexity but no purpose right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">an inappropriate application</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">there but there&#39;s also the question of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">so evolutionary principles so</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">you know selection might be understood</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.599" end="01:04:48.319" style="s2">as an evolutionary principle an</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:49.599" style="s2">adaptation might be understood as an</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">evolutionary principle</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.599" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">and selection as you have very</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">frequently</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">laid out selection can exist with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">tidal action on a beach</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.920" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">arranging rocks in a particular order by</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">size</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s no you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">nothing biotic there it&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">biology but that is selection in action</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no adaptation there yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">adaptation is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">that is going to exist only at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">bottom that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">the right distinction and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:21.119" style="s2">we subsume</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">selection into biology space is wrong so</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">right exactly hence</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">where lee smolen is in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">using principles for the universe</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:32.559" style="s2">basically these are principles that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:32.559" style="s2">upstream of biology</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:37.280" style="s2">okay so where they commonly applied when</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.280" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think that category</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:44.760" style="s2">exists but they are often</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">commonly applied badly or</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.760" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">non-evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">thinking which is cloaked and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">is applied in places where it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">be and hence we get things like social</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:56.400" style="s2">darwinism</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:58.319" style="s2">and eugenics and all sorts of other</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.400" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">really bad [ __ ] crazy thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.319" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">um rides around looking like evolution</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s not yeah now where does it</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">absolutely neces</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">where is it absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">medicine psychology</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">dentistry ophthalmology these are places</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">where it is largely absent and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">the cost to us is absolutely immense</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">yep economics economics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">it&#39;s already there because so evolution</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2">and economics sort of co-invented game</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:25.760" style="s2">theory yeah i mean axelrod and hamilton</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">is right there like at the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.760" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">so in fact in that case i would say a</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">lot has to go the other way</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:33.440" style="s2">right so diminishing returns is invented</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">inside of</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:37.760" style="s2">uh in economics yeah and it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">economic principle</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an evolutionary principle that</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:44.160" style="s2">works in economics and so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:44.640" style="s2">actually pull it out to the higher level</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.160" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">very important that you do yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">hi please respond to social media forces</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:56.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">excuse me social media forces people who</p>

<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:01.280" style="s2">reality in a way they never have and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.920" end="01:07:02.720" style="s2">that scares them</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.280" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">it also allows the same people to</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:10.000" style="s2">true on both fronts i would say um and i</p>

<p begin="01:07:10.000" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">i assume that the person writing the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.200" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">question is using the phrase who never</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">leave the house</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:17.839" style="s2">with some hyperbole you know everyone</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">almost everyone leaves the house a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.839" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">people really do have narrower and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:24.480" style="s2">narrower scopes</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:26.559" style="s2">of experience especially this year you</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.480" end="01:07:30.000" style="s2">know especially since march of this year</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.559" end="01:07:32.079" style="s2">but increasingly people who got</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.000" end="01:07:34.000" style="s2">the number of people i see evidence of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.079" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">on social media</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">who&#39;s you know who are you know fighting</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:39.599" style="s2">the good fight and being woke</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">and saying you know i&#39;m a i&#39;m a dad and</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.599" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">i&#39;m a parent of two and you must be</p>

<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">like i don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.000" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">anywhere have you like you</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">you actually are afraid of the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">the world and you lecturing me</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">about uh eurocentric vision of the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think you actually know what</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">that would even mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">like why don&#39;t you actually go somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">and talk to some people who don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:02.319" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">um maybe even a different language even</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.319" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">if you don&#39;t really speak that language</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">have a beer with them</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:08.720" style="s2">sit down you&#39;ll be able to communicate a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.559" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">lot even without much shared language</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.720" end="01:08:12.799" style="s2">see what that&#39;s like and then get back</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">to me about how we&#39;re all racist</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.799" end="01:08:16.239" style="s2">like seriously let&#39;s let&#39;s talk after</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone out and experienced</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.239" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.799" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not like everything else you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:23.120" style="s2">ever experienced i think most people</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that increasingly more i</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.120" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know most more and more people</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">haven&#39;t managed to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">outside of their own sphere yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">which is less and less incentivized to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">the extent that you can source</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">little bits of uh excitement and what</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">feels like</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:39.759" style="s2">exposure it feels like exposure but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">not because it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.759" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">safe because nothing can reach out and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">shock you or</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">hurt you or surprise you or make like</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.199" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">it&#39;s totally safe</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s totally sanitized so</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">um i think also though implicit in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.839" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">is and i must say i&#39;m involved in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.839" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">private conversation an ongoing one</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to out anybody but there</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">a conjecture in this conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:11.679" style="s2">people who are socially uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:14.960" style="s2">and maybe not especially well skilled</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.679" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">playing a larger and larger role in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.960" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">online interactions with each other yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">and that basically that</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">sensitivity is manifesting in uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">dysfunctional ways that we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:28.319" style="s2">all becoming dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:29.759" style="s2">in the context of these rules that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.319" end="01:09:31.920" style="s2">possibly be adhered to</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.759" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">and and things like this so i do think</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.920" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">there&#39;s interest to it yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s not just that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:42.239" style="s2">being made worse but that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:43.040" style="s2">um what&#39;s driving it is some some subset</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.239" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">of people who</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.040" end="01:09:48.560" style="s2">started out more dysfunctional than most</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">of us yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.560" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">good afternoon to you both what do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">imagine is the evolutionary explanation</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">for fainting goats</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">i own four of them i can&#39;t quite figure</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">out how they survived without human</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:10:00.320" style="s2">intervention</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">thoughts i never quite remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.320" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">what the story is on fainting goats i</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">this is one of these things that it just</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:07.520" style="s2">like it enters my head briefly</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">and it there&#39;s something that seems so</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.520" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">amorphous or not quite real about it to</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:12.640" style="s2">me that i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:14.880" style="s2">what the story is you got it no i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.640" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">more or less the same same boat i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">i think they are domestic goats so</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:19.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve been created by</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.560" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.040" end="01:10:22.480" style="s2">right which basically somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">selected for somehow well we selected</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.480" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">for something and fainting campaign</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why i said somehow yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">selected for something that was</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.159" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">associated with fainting or maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:32.159" style="s2">some yahoo decide to actually select for</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">fainting who knows well it could be you</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.159" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">know you could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.280" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">that a goat you know obviously we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">raise goats for</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">wool but let&#39;s just say that you had an</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:43.760" style="s2">animal like that you could</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">select for sudden passivity right</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.760" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know that well</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:52.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying i don&#39;t i mean fainting</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">is sudden passivity i just hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.560" end="01:10:56.840" style="s2">framed it that way in my sudden</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:11:00.400" style="s2">catastrophic passivity</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.840" end="01:11:02.239" style="s2">right yes i&#39;ve never actually suffered</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.400" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">sudden catastrophic passion certainly</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.239" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">i&#39;d never know you to do so</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll get you the goat salts right</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:09.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">um yeah so anyway there could be</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.520" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">something you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:16.000" style="s2">to select for that would directly reward</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">that there could be something</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.000" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">where you select something that carries</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">it along as a byproduct</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">um but unless it&#39;s wild goats then the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.520" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">question doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:30.960" style="s2">exist on the other hand yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">possums play possibly i just yeah yep um</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.960" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">because it causes animals that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">reluctant to eat</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">uh already dead prey to mess with them</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">so and they do smell actually it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:42.560" style="s2">interesting when you just said that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:45.679" style="s2">occurred to me</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.560" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">um the possums who are the organisms</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.679" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">that play dead as a way of not getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">eaten</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:52.840" style="s2">come pre-smelled so so it&#39;s it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.840" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">behavioral defense than it would be if</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:11:58.719" style="s2">they smelled fresh</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.560" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">and also goats smell goats and</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.719" end="01:12:03.199" style="s2">everything associated with goat&#39;s smell</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:04.000" style="s2">what do they smell like uh there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.199" end="01:12:06.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.000" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">goatee smell that is yeah on you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.320" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">detect in some</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">goat cheese goat milk so are you</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">proposing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re they&#39;re playing dead i am</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">saying that is a hypothesis here that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:20.960" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">predictions i&#39;m not saying i believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.960" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">that&#39;s the case but i believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s if it turns out that wild</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">goats</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">faint ever yeah then that would be the</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:30.800" style="s2">next place i would yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">sure i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on behind</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.800" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">our curtain here but</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">someone is definitely not playing dead</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">yeah something like that yeah okay uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">let&#39;s get a couple more of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">in here uh this</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">is going to be a recommendation of</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.760" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">something to look at jerry pornell</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.360" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">phd&#39;s better political access um</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">oh is that an alternative to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:54.560" style="s2">political compass i guess</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:55.120" style="s2">um so i can&#39;t quite it&#39;s hard for me to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.560" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.120" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t i can&#39;t do it here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:13:01.920" style="s2">in drive and it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">um we&#39;ll take a look okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.920" end="01:13:05.920" style="s2">is the legalization of human vices like</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">gambling prostitution and drugs</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:10.640" style="s2">of net benefit to society as a safe</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">outlet or of net detriment</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.640" end="01:13:16.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s a small question isn&#39;t it um</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:17.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.480" end="01:13:19.199" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.120" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">to all of those yeah i agree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.199" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">different depending upon which one</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s not just human vices but</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">gambling prostitution drugs</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:30.320" style="s2">and you know then within drugs um even</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:33.360" style="s2">even gambling has multiple</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.320" end="01:13:34.159" style="s2">things like you know i feel i feel</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.360" end="01:13:37.840" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.159" end="01:13:39.120" style="s2">about um making it really easy for</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.840" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">people to waste their</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.120" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">their money on computerized slots</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">in gas stations uh than the prospect of</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:51.280" style="s2">you know betting on the outcomes of</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:51.840" style="s2">races for instance yep um it just</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.280" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.840" end="01:13:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s much more at stake you just</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.400" end="01:13:56.880" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.040" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">you just have more skin in the game and</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">you there&#39;s more of a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">structure it&#39;s more of a community</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:01.040" style="s2">possible well there might even be</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:03.040" style="s2">something real</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.040" end="01:14:04.880" style="s2">i mean yeah being able to interpret</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.040" end="01:14:05.920" style="s2">which horse is likely to win under what</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.880" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.920" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">there might be some skill fields right</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:13.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s at least in principle not</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">empty the way a a slot or even worse a</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.199" end="01:14:18.320" style="s2">computerized slot yeah would be yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">again you know poker is real yeah court</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.320" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">cards is even more real</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the underlying card</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:25.360" style="s2">game and then there&#39;s also the human</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:27.920" style="s2">dynamics meeting the people</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">you know who&#39;s bluffing so that could be</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.920" end="01:14:31.360" style="s2">that could have</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">value in it the question poses it as an</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.360" end="01:14:33.679" style="s2">outlet</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve wondered about this with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.679" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">prostitution</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">and on the one hand you would imagine</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:44.159" style="s2">that prostitution probably reduces the</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:47.199" style="s2">amount of</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">rape in the world because uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.199" end="01:14:51.840" style="s2">likely</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.239" end="01:14:54.840" style="s2">you know an outlet on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.840" end="01:14:56.239" style="s2">uh prostitutes are very vulnerable so it</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.840" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">channels</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.239" end="01:14:59.679" style="s2">some of that violence onto a vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.679" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">and that whole conversation is so</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:09.120" style="s2">so damaged right now by the so-called</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.600" end="01:15:11.600" style="s2">sex positivity movement right</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.120" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">which wants us to celebrate all outlets</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.600" end="01:15:16.000" style="s2">of sexuality at all times and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">simply say that sex workers are doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.000" end="01:15:18.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">admirable and amazing work it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.640" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">you can you can simultaneously say</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:25.440" style="s2">that some forms of prostitution probably</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:28.640" style="s2">should be legal</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.440" end="01:15:30.719" style="s2">for the safety of prostitutes frankly</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.640" end="01:15:32.159" style="s2">and also simultaneously be trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.719" end="01:15:35.679" style="s2">absolutely minimize</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.159" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">um 100 percent minimize</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.679" end="01:15:41.920" style="s2">sex work in in the world yep</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">but i would i would also add there is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.920" end="01:15:45.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">about what the effect um on</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.640" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">relationships is yeah in other words to</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">the extent</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">that um the normal situation basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">uh uses sex as an incentive to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">uh you know good relations with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:05.040" style="s2">to the extent that people have an</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:07.520" style="s2">economic outlet to free them</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.040" end="01:16:08.400" style="s2">uh it may be very bad for relationships</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.520" end="01:16:10.719" style="s2">and so absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.400" end="01:16:11.679" style="s2">anyway certainly an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.719" end="01:16:14.960" style="s2">i think you would want</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.679" end="01:16:16.080" style="s2">um you would want systematic study of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.960" end="01:16:19.840" style="s2">what the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.080" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">is you know in similar situations that</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.840" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">have different rules about these things</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:24.640" style="s2">and then you know with regard to drugs</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.800" end="01:16:26.080" style="s2">such as you know there&#39;s drugs isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.640" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">thing right we&#39;ve already we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.080" end="01:16:29.520" style="s2">legal drugs already</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">um and we&#39;ve got a lot of drugs that are</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.520" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">not legal and</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.960" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">um this is a longer conversation</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:38.960" style="s2">but you know at one level at first very</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:42.080" style="s2">broad brush</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.960" end="01:16:43.840" style="s2">pass the drugs that have been</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.080" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">synthesized and enhanced and</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.840" end="01:16:47.280" style="s2">concentrated in lab</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.360" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">and then are taken in high concentration</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">form into the body</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">are um are likely to be the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">are most dangerous and should most 100</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.360" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">percent be kept away from</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:58.719" style="s2">um you know almost anyone knowing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">they&#39;re out there in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.719" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">people are still going to find them</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">but um the question of say legalizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:07.120" style="s2">hallucinogens</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:09.199" style="s2">both strong and weak uh versus uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.120" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">cocaine um are really those</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.199" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2">conversations should be happening in</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">different places well and</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:18.560" style="s2">cocaine versus coca and</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:20.320" style="s2">um heroin versus opium yep</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.560" end="01:17:21.840" style="s2">right these are very different questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.320" end="01:17:22.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s the concentration that makes</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.840" end="01:17:26.000" style="s2">these things lethal</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.880" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">yeah um and that is not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.000" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">molecule itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:33.199" style="s2">yeah what are you planning to do when</p>

<p begin="01:18:30.719" end="01:18:36.000" style="s2">the general election of 2016</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:36.640" style="s2">which at the time seemed uh pointless</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.000" end="01:18:39.280" style="s2">pointless</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.640" end="01:18:40.080" style="s2">and it turned out to be really important</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.280" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.080" end="01:18:44.560" style="s2">yeah i think the the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">reading ourselves with the system that</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.560" end="01:18:48.880" style="s2">keeps giving us</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">unacceptable choices is so great</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.880" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">that uh as much as i understand the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">arguments against doing it</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the only path yeah um the cat is</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:19:01.360" style="s2">blocking my screen</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:01.360" style="s2">oh is he all right there we go</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:07.040" style="s2">do you concede to the possibility of you</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.040" end="01:19:08.159" style="s2">being unable to honestly look into and</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:10.880" style="s2">talk about conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.159" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2">theories either due to lifelong</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.880" end="01:19:14.239" style="s2">mainstream media conditioning or out of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.400" end="01:19:16.080" style="s2">fear for your reputation</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.239" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">are there any conspiracies you believe</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.080" end="01:19:20.560" style="s2">jfk 911</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:22.159" style="s2">so the beginning do you concede to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.560" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">possibility of you being unable to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.159" end="01:19:26.159" style="s2">honestly look into and talk about look</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">into and talk about are different</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.159" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">right um i mean i think i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:33.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the key well look into and talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:35.199" style="s2">about are different and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.280" end="01:19:36.800" style="s2">um lifelong mainstream media</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.199" end="01:19:38.400" style="s2">conditioning or out of fear for your</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.800" end="01:19:39.600" style="s2">reputation are two different possible</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.400" end="01:19:43.120" style="s2">reasons so</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.600" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">um we&#39;ve talked about between ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:47.600" style="s2">an awful lot of things much of which we</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:49.040" style="s2">have not yet shared publicly some of</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.600" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">which we may never</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.040" end="01:19:52.800" style="s2">why why don&#39;t we why don&#39;t we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.440" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">everything that we why don&#39;t we talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.800" end="01:19:54.960" style="s2">publicly about everything that we talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:58.960" style="s2">about privately</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.960" end="01:20:01.199" style="s2">i think the question um</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.960" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">reveals the problem right as soon as you</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.199" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">say conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:08.639" style="s2">my sense is you&#39;re [ __ ] up right</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:09.760" style="s2">not conspiracy theory conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.639" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">if we use the term</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.760" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">theory consistently means a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:16.320" style="s2">hypothesis of conspiracy that has</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:19.600" style="s2">withstood</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.320" end="01:20:22.800" style="s2">test right it is a proven conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.600" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">so conspiracy hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.800" end="01:20:27.199" style="s2">i believe we are in a better position to</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">talk about that than most people because</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:30.800" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">discipline to be had surrounding the uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.800" end="01:20:36.159" style="s2">the underlying logic the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">science that goes into knowing what did</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.159" end="01:20:39.440" style="s2">and did not take place</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">involves advancing hypotheses</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.440" end="01:20:42.880" style="s2">predictions that would tell you if they</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">were true and then testing them so</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.880" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">um anyway i feel at liberty to talk in</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">the context</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:52.560" style="s2">of conspiracy hypotheses i feel</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:54.719" style="s2">jeopardized by the fact that if we talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.560" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">about a conspiracy hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.719" end="01:20:58.320" style="s2">there is this eagerness to immediately</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:20:59.280" style="s2">say ah you&#39;re advancing conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.320" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">theories it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.280" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">i said hypothesis for a reason right so</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:06.400" style="s2">if the world would be better at</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">recognizing the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.400" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">somebody who is talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">in the context of hypothesis where we</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:15.199" style="s2">know what it is that will</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:17.040" style="s2">validate or discount uh any particular</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.199" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">instance then fine then we can have</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.040" end="01:21:20.719" style="s2">great conversations</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to talk as if people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.719" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">entertain conspiracy hypotheses</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">are conspiracy theorists well then now</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:28.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a trap</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a kafka trap and i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.400" end="01:21:32.639" style="s2">play that game so</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.840" end="01:21:34.400" style="s2">anyway let&#39;s do it properly okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.639" end="01:21:35.040" style="s2">do it properly let&#39;s just get a little</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.400" end="01:21:37.360" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.040" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">drill down a little bit more on the idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.360" end="01:21:40.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">um has lifelong mainstream media</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.159" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">conditioning</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">made it impossible for us to even</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.280" end="01:21:50.400" style="s2">some some possible uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">avenues here i don&#39;t i don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.400" end="01:21:54.960" style="s2">think so because</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">well i because i know the extent of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.960" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">things that we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:21:59.840" style="s2">looked into and considered and talked</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">about right and you should be too</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.840" end="01:22:05.520" style="s2">and yet and many of which still wonder</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">you know there&#39;s just the jury is out on</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.520" end="01:22:09.760" style="s2">a lot of these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:11.199" style="s2">and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not worth talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.760" end="01:22:14.480" style="s2">about some of them publicly</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.199" end="01:22:16.719" style="s2">yet maybe ever but um</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.480" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of bat [ __ ] sounding ideas</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.719" end="01:22:20.239" style="s2">that may not actually be untrue well but</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:23.040" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.239" end="01:22:24.880" style="s2">glorious thing about using hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.040" end="01:22:26.560" style="s2">for its intended use is the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.880" end="01:22:28.560" style="s2">one advances a</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.560" end="01:22:29.920" style="s2">hypothesis that involves a conspiracy</p>

<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:23:00.159" style="s2">exactly looking it up would you</p>

<p begin="01:23:16.320" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">i mean at one level this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.920" end="01:23:23.520" style="s2">question like what&#39;s your favorite</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:23.520" style="s2">movie that in the like</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:37.760" style="s2">um so it&#39;s possible i&#39;ll come up with</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">something here but i</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.760" end="01:23:41.840" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure you know i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s framed this way</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.840" end="01:23:46.320" style="s2">i&#39;m not even sure maybe that you know 20</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">minutes after we&#39;re done here it&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="01:23:47.360" end="01:23:52.560" style="s2">but i think in some sense the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.440" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.560" end="01:23:57.440" style="s2">is such that you know a disagreement is</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:24:00.239" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.440" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">trivial and therefore not likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.239" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">long-standing in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:05.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be a topic that keeps</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">recruiting we might not resolve it but</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.199" end="01:24:08.719" style="s2">we move on</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2">right yeah or it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.719" end="01:24:11.280" style="s2">going to take</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.360" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">work to figure out what we actually do</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.280" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">believe and you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.639" end="01:24:16.400" style="s2">there have been plenty of places where i</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">have thought something you have</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.400" end="01:24:21.120" style="s2">thought something inconsistent with it</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:23.760" style="s2">and i know in retrospect you were right</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.120" end="01:24:25.679" style="s2">there are others where i was right and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.760" end="01:24:28.400" style="s2">think the point is</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.679" end="01:24:28.400" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.719" end="01:24:33.120" style="s2">evidence of something being off if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.440" end="01:24:34.639" style="s2">do have lots of long-standing</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.120" end="01:24:36.400" style="s2">disagreements that you do you know is it</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.639" end="01:24:38.320" style="s2">a kind of baggage that accumulates in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.400" end="01:24:40.080" style="s2">relationship and so in fact in effect</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.320" end="01:24:42.080" style="s2">what you want to do is put in the work</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.080" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">to actually figure out who&#39;s right or if</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.080" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not either one of you then</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">what is it that you haven&#39;t figured out</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:49.679" style="s2">about you know what explains</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:51.360" style="s2">some discontinuity well there can be i</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.679" end="01:24:52.719" style="s2">mean i guess there are a number of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.360" end="01:24:55.040" style="s2">ways that one can understand the word</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.719" end="01:24:56.719" style="s2">disagreement right so</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.040" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">no two humans are totally compatible</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:25:00.800" style="s2">with one another we will</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:02.159" style="s2">i found it okay hold on though yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:04.480" style="s2">will uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.159" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">two two humans living closely for</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.480" end="01:25:07.120" style="s2">decades will drive each other crazy in</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:10.639" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.120" end="01:25:12.639" style="s2">no matter what and um those things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.639" end="01:25:13.040" style="s2">will be persistent could be understood</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.639" end="01:25:15.840" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.040" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">a disagreement but more to the point i</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.840" end="01:25:20.080" style="s2">think it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:22.480" style="s2">sort of every now and again like okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.080" end="01:25:25.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to check in like this thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.480" end="01:25:27.440" style="s2">that we already know we aren&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.440" end="01:25:28.000" style="s2">sympatico on is driving me crazy at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.440" end="01:25:30.000" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.000" end="01:25:31.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s where i am and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.000" end="01:25:32.400" style="s2">you need to know that that&#39;s in my head</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.360" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">at the moment so</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.400" end="01:25:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not i don&#39;t i&#39;m not thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:37.199" style="s2">any particular examples but we could</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.600" end="01:25:38.639" style="s2">we could come up with those you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.199" end="01:25:40.159" style="s2">there aren&#39;t any that are you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.639" end="01:25:41.760" style="s2">years old i don&#39;t think or you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.159" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">certainly not decades old</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.760" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">but there&#39;s certainly like repeated</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:48.000" style="s2">types of things just because we are the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">at some level the same people that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.000" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">have been forever so what did you come</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:53.440" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:53.440" style="s2">dark chocolate</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.679" end="01:25:57.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know which way you think</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:25:58.560" style="s2">this goes um</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.040" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">that that i like dark chocolate and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.560" end="01:26:03.199" style="s2">don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:05.600" style="s2">okay i think that that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.199" end="01:26:07.199" style="s2">and you know i have been saying for some</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.600" end="01:26:10.800" style="s2">time that</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.199" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">dark chocolate is objectively inferior</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.800" end="01:26:14.159" style="s2">and that there is a way in which it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:18.480" style="s2">fetishized well i</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.159" end="01:26:18.480" style="s2">i feel like i grant that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.960" end="01:26:25.520" style="s2">but but you do have</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.159" end="01:26:29.120" style="s2">dark chocolate rather than preferring</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.520" end="01:26:30.880" style="s2">milk chocolate so i i batch</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:33.040" style="s2">at the moment instead of sober october</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.880" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">we&#39;re doing sugar-free october so</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.040" end="01:26:36.880" style="s2">there&#39;s i&#39;m buying chocolate for the</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:37.600" style="s2">boys to have and one of our children</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.880" end="01:26:39.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.600" end="01:26:40.880" style="s2">uh like dairy and so he doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.360" end="01:26:42.480" style="s2">milk chocolate and so i get dark</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.880" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">chocolate for him</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.480" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.520" end="01:26:51.120" style="s2">often there are things</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.560" end="01:26:52.480" style="s2">on offer in the dark chocolate area that</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.120" end="01:26:53.840" style="s2">i find more interesting than what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.480" end="01:26:55.679" style="s2">available in the milk chocolate and i</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.840" end="01:26:56.239" style="s2">think in general the quality is higher</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.679" end="01:26:57.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.239" end="01:26:59.360" style="s2">maybe in part because it has been</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.360" end="01:27:00.880" style="s2">fetishized because like if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.360" end="01:27:01.520" style="s2">can afford the slightly higher price</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:03.520" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.520" end="01:27:04.960" style="s2">um and you know if they&#39;re going to put</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.520" end="01:27:07.679" style="s2">dried cherries and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.960" end="01:27:08.320" style="s2">and almonds into the dark chocolate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.679" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.320" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">delicious and the the comparable milk</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">chocolate might be a lower quality</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">chocolate and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to control for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:20.480" style="s2">cacao content and the quality</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.080" end="01:27:22.400" style="s2">simultaneously yeah i agree and there</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.480" end="01:27:24.719" style="s2">are some places where</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:26.400" style="s2">dark chocolate by virtue of its having</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.719" end="01:27:27.199" style="s2">been mixed with something else is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.400" end="01:27:30.639" style="s2">the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.199" end="01:27:33.600" style="s2">yeah but on its own seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.639" end="01:27:34.639" style="s2">no contest ever and you you found an</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.600" end="01:27:36.480" style="s2">essay this year</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.639" end="01:27:37.760" style="s2">and you argued this very forcefully</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.480" end="01:27:40.000" style="s2">which i thought was</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.760" end="01:27:41.440" style="s2">was beautiful but yeah um anyway from</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.000" end="01:27:41.840" style="s2">what it was something about oh maybe it</p>

<p begin="01:28:45.840" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">means i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.199" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">i don&#39;t know either um</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.880" end="01:28:55.440" style="s2">most of that looks looks good to me</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.199" end="01:28:59.280" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing on your list that i</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.440" end="01:29:01.199" style="s2">have a problem with which is um</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.280" end="01:29:02.560" style="s2">no access to abortion no i yeah i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.199" end="01:29:03.840" style="s2">want to say anti-abortion just like i</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.560" end="01:29:05.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.840" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">that would be the pro-life position um</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.760" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">but i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:11.440" style="s2">pro-choice at least for um early term</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.920" end="01:29:13.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.440" end="01:29:14.800" style="s2">and uh evidence throughout the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.440" end="01:29:17.679" style="s2">suggests that uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.800" end="01:29:18.560" style="s2">women who have access to abortion end up</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.679" end="01:29:20.560" style="s2">in society</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.560" end="01:29:22.880" style="s2">in societies where women have access to</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.560" end="01:29:25.760" style="s2">early term abortion those societies</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.880" end="01:29:27.440" style="s2">uh have even just economic measures like</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.760" end="01:29:29.760" style="s2">higher gdp and higher levels of</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:33.120" style="s2">education of both men and women</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.760" end="01:29:35.600" style="s2">lower birth rates obviously maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.120" end="01:29:37.600" style="s2">and just higher levels of productivity</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.600" end="01:29:38.320" style="s2">without necessarily just producing more</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.600" end="01:29:40.800" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.320" end="01:29:41.840" style="s2">so there are a lot of reasons that i am</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.800" end="01:29:44.639" style="s2">i am</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.840" end="01:29:45.840" style="s2">pro-choice but otherwise everything on</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.639" end="01:29:48.000" style="s2">that list seems</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.840" end="01:29:48.960" style="s2">interesting and relevant i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.000" end="01:29:50.719" style="s2">what the final question</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.960" end="01:29:52.080" style="s2">means origin point of political matrix</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.719" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">useful beyond the present</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.080" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">you know what that means i don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">and you know anything about the american</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:29:57.840" style="s2">solidarity party</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:30:00.400" style="s2">no i can&#39;t say that that rings a bell</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.840" end="01:30:02.639" style="s2">not for me either i haven&#39;t heard of it</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.400" end="01:30:04.239" style="s2">next question might humans have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.639" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">predisposition to mate with those of</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.239" end="01:30:07.120" style="s2">different ethnicities</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:08.320" style="s2">it seems mixed-race offspring are better</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.120" end="01:30:09.679" style="s2">looking and more intelligent than</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.320" end="01:30:10.719" style="s2">average as compared to the polar</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.679" end="01:30:13.280" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.719" end="01:30:13.280" style="s2">in breeding</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.920" end="01:30:20.000" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way this is a topic</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.880" end="01:30:23.440" style="s2">that gets ugly pretty</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.000" end="01:30:26.800" style="s2">quick but from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.440" end="01:30:30.560" style="s2">of males looking</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.800" end="01:30:33.679" style="s2">to reproduce without commitment then yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.560" end="01:30:33.679" style="s2">you would expect this</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.760" end="01:30:40.239" style="s2">for reasons of genetic intragression</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.040" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">so there will be many circumstances in</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.239" end="01:30:44.480" style="s2">history that reflect this predisposition</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.600" end="01:30:46.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.480" end="01:30:47.840" style="s2">that necessarily the same predisposition</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.960" end="01:30:49.920" style="s2">will exist</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.840" end="01:30:51.360" style="s2">in the context of high investment</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.920" end="01:30:52.159" style="s2">relationships you would predict a much</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.360" end="01:30:54.320" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.159" end="01:30:58.000" style="s2">complicated pattern for both males and</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.320" end="01:31:00.239" style="s2">females it would depend a lot on</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.000" end="01:31:02.400" style="s2">various costs and benefits which you</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.239" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">could do the analysis but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.400" end="01:31:06.159" style="s2">topic for another time um it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:06.880" style="s2">one but it&#39;s not going to be a simple</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.159" end="01:31:09.120" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.880" end="01:31:10.320" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m going to um drop down i just</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.120" end="01:31:11.280" style="s2">scrolled through there&#39;s actually a lot</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.320" end="01:31:12.480" style="s2">more questions that we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.280" end="01:31:13.360" style="s2">get to we&#39;ll get to some of them next</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.480" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.360" end="01:31:16.639" style="s2">uh this one which is similarly fraught</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:18.719" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.639" end="01:31:20.960" style="s2">related have you read a natural theory</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.719" end="01:31:21.760" style="s2">of rape by randy thornhill and craig t</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.960" end="01:31:22.719" style="s2">palmer</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.760" end="01:31:24.400" style="s2">and do you believe there is some</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.719" end="01:31:26.159" style="s2">credibility that the act of rape was not</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.400" end="01:31:27.760" style="s2">about power but a biological trait for</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.159" end="01:31:29.679" style="s2">primitive non-alpha males to continue</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.760" end="01:31:32.719" style="s2">their genes</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.679" end="01:31:35.840" style="s2">so the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.719" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">modern feminist trope that we are</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.840" end="01:31:39.520" style="s2">expected to accept</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:40.560" style="s2">that rape is just about power is clearly</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.520" end="01:31:42.719" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.560" end="01:31:44.320" style="s2">obviously where did that even come from</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.719" end="01:31:46.159" style="s2">where could that pot like what what what</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.320" end="01:31:49.280" style="s2">would that even mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.159" end="01:31:52.400" style="s2">um was it</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.280" end="01:31:54.080" style="s2">a strategy that worked for some yes is</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.400" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">it a reprehensible and disgusting</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.080" end="01:31:57.840" style="s2">strategy that should be</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.520" end="01:31:59.280" style="s2">criminalized every place all the time</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.840" end="01:32:01.920" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.280" end="01:32:03.600" style="s2">uh yeah um back in the day and i at</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.920" end="01:32:04.000" style="s2">least skimmed it um you know that that</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.600" end="01:32:07.040" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.000" end="01:32:08.159" style="s2">sort of that that book 90s i think so we</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.040" end="01:32:11.199" style="s2">knew randy thornhill</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.159" end="01:32:13.360" style="s2">at the time um i will say</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.199" end="01:32:15.360" style="s2">when that book came came out every</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.360" end="01:32:17.920" style="s2">evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.360" end="01:32:19.199" style="s2">working at the time had the same sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.920" end="01:32:21.920" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.199" end="01:32:24.480" style="s2">well this isn&#39;t exactly news yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.920" end="01:32:28.239" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s an evolutionary strategy</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.480" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">um but that this is making a big splash</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.239" end="01:32:32.000" style="s2">based on taking something that we all</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:34.080" style="s2">understood to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.000" end="01:32:35.600" style="s2">and revealing it as if it was</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.080" end="01:32:39.760" style="s2">provocative</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.600" end="01:32:43.920" style="s2">now is it a low-ranking</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.760" end="01:32:47.600" style="s2">strategy that can be it&#39;s not the only</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.920" end="01:32:49.199" style="s2">context um so anyway what i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.600" end="01:32:52.159" style="s2">war is another context well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.199" end="01:32:55.679" style="s2">thing is this is in large measure how</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.159" end="01:32:56.639" style="s2">war was paid for until uh a certain</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.679" end="01:32:58.480" style="s2">point in history</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.639" end="01:33:00.239" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s lots of stuff and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.480" end="01:33:02.800" style="s2">will find it uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.239" end="01:33:03.920" style="s2">more or less described you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.800" end="01:33:06.960" style="s2">bible there are</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.920" end="01:33:09.199" style="s2">rules moses uh laws of war</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.960" end="01:33:10.320" style="s2">describe things that you would have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.199" end="01:33:13.760" style="s2">take to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.320" end="01:33:14.560" style="s2">rape um and setting out rules for them</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.760" end="01:33:15.920" style="s2">so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.560" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a lot here it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.920" end="01:33:18.400" style="s2">ancient strategy it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.400" end="01:33:25.280" style="s2">but rape is an evolutionary strategy</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:27.600" style="s2">laws against rape are an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.280" end="01:33:29.120" style="s2">strategy right this is more complex than</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.600" end="01:33:30.800" style="s2">we give it credit for so</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.120" end="01:33:32.320" style="s2">the problem with that book was the</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.800" end="01:33:34.639" style="s2">implication of saying</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.320" end="01:33:36.000" style="s2">rape is an evolutionary strategy</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.639" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">suggests that it</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.000" end="01:33:39.360" style="s2">people jump to naturalistic fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:39.840" style="s2">right like oh well then it&#39;s inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.360" end="01:33:41.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.840" end="01:33:43.120" style="s2">what can you do about it like you can do</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.440" end="01:33:44.960" style="s2">a lot about it and you and we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.120" end="01:33:46.159" style="s2">a lot about it and we need to stop it</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.960" end="01:33:47.600" style="s2">right the fact is you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.159" end="01:33:49.199" style="s2">evolutionary strategies that doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:50.000" style="s2">either one of them is any good but our</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.199" end="01:33:53.120" style="s2">values tell us</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.000" end="01:33:53.679" style="s2">one of them is abhorrent and that you</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.120" end="01:33:55.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.679" end="01:33:56.719" style="s2">making it so costly that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.760" end="01:33:59.280" style="s2">engage in it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.719" end="01:34:00.400" style="s2">obviously the right thing to do yep so</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.280" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">there&#39;s just a couple things about</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.400" end="01:34:04.000" style="s2">helium here that maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:05.280" style="s2">stop stop with and the next time we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.000" end="01:34:06.880" style="s2">come back around and get a few of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.280" end="01:34:08.719" style="s2">other ones we didn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.880" end="01:34:10.639" style="s2">uh too much helium might disable the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.719" end="01:34:12.159" style="s2">mems chip outright rather than altering</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.639" end="01:34:14.719" style="s2">the frequency</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.159" end="01:34:16.400" style="s2">um i believe that might be possible</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.719" end="01:34:19.760" style="s2">these mems</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.400" end="01:34:22.639" style="s2">they&#39;re very mysterious little objects</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.760" end="01:34:25.360" style="s2">now my sense is that normal levels of</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.639" end="01:34:28.560" style="s2">helium that might be encountered</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.360" end="01:34:29.280" style="s2">uh diffuse in cause the object very</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.560" end="01:34:31.360" style="s2">frequently</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.280" end="01:34:32.960" style="s2">to be unusable for a period of time as</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.360" end="01:34:34.960" style="s2">if it is dead and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.960" end="01:34:36.239" style="s2">it slowly diffuses out and they revive</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.960" end="01:34:37.360" style="s2">but could you damage the thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.239" end="01:34:39.120" style="s2">permanently</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.360" end="01:34:41.040" style="s2">i believe that is possible at least in</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.120" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">some cases</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.040" end="01:34:44.880" style="s2">okay and please do the helium test on</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:46.719" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.880" end="01:34:48.880" style="s2">on camera recorded not necessarily live</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.719" end="01:34:50.639" style="s2">stream but would be interested to watch</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.880" end="01:34:51.920" style="s2">uh it wouldn&#39;t be fast enough would it i</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.639" end="01:34:53.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know it might be</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.920" end="01:34:56.000" style="s2">okay but it but what you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.520" end="01:34:57.760" style="s2">do is have a process that&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.000" end="01:35:00.400" style="s2">and therefore seems to falsify the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.760" end="01:35:01.119" style="s2">hypothesis that then later on turns out</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.400" end="01:35:05.040" style="s2">to be right so</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.119" end="01:35:07.760" style="s2">yeah it might be that you want to record</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.040" end="01:35:08.480" style="s2">the entire test and then if it takes 10</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.760" end="01:35:10.800" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.480" end="01:35:12.239" style="s2">to trigger it the point is all right</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.800" end="01:35:13.360" style="s2">here&#39;s the place in the test where we</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.239" end="01:35:14.480" style="s2">first see the flaw</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.360" end="01:35:16.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s why they said not live</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.480" end="01:35:20.000" style="s2">stream just oh</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.480" end="01:35:20.000" style="s2">right yes you got it right</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.239" end="01:35:23.920" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just finish with this</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.679" end="01:35:25.280" style="s2">appreciation comment thanks so so much</p>
