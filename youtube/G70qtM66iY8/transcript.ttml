<p begin="00:00:14.850" end="00:00:20.440" style="s2">when there&#39;s increased volatility in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:22.960" style="s2">market there&#39;s more opportunity to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.440" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">more money if you play it right then</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">when the market has less volatility and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:34.570" style="s2">similarly when there&#39;s just increased</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.180" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">volatility and say geopolitics as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.570" end="00:00:38.950" style="s2">whole there&#39;s more ability for more</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">significant grabs of power than there</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.950" end="00:00:46.450" style="s2">are when things are more equilibria and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">so the saying never let a good crisis go</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.450" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">to waste</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">sometimes crises are just completely</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.130" end="00:00:55.810" style="s2">made-up right they&#39;re false flagged</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:58.720" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re not false flagged but</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.810" end="00:01:02.950" style="s2">they are they just naturally emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.720" end="00:01:04.269" style="s2">then some agents are more focused to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.950" end="00:01:07.899" style="s2">how they can advance the agendas they</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.269" end="00:01:09.640" style="s2">already had utilizing the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.899" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">that situation rather than try to fix</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.640" end="00:01:19.540" style="s2">the situation so let&#39;s say for instance</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:23.170" style="s2">that I was one of the many people that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.540" end="00:01:25.330" style="s2">got good intelligence back in early</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.170" end="00:01:29.560" style="s2">January about what was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.330" end="00:01:30.850" style="s2">Wuhan and how many people five to seven</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.560" end="00:01:36.549" style="s2">million people left who hung before</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.850" end="00:01:38.290" style="s2">quarantine and that they got on planes</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.549" end="00:01:42.100" style="s2">not to the rest of China but to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.290" end="00:01:44.500" style="s2">of the world and what was likely to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.100" end="00:01:47.320" style="s2">happen from that so we see some senators</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.500" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">that sold stock in January right but</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.320" end="00:01:53.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a small part like those are</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:56.140" style="s2">formal intelligence briefings to people</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.890" end="00:01:57.729" style="s2">who have classified access but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.140" end="00:01:59.380" style="s2">private intelligence agencies largely</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.729" end="00:02:00.700" style="s2">work for hedge funds and financial</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.380" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">institutions and things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.700" end="00:02:08.470" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at the same information</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">so if I run a hedge fund and I see that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:12.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a situation that could have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:13.959" style="s2">meaningful downturn to the economy but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.579" end="00:02:14.300" style="s2">can make money when the economy goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.959" end="00:02:17.600" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.300" end="00:02:18.980" style="s2">and we&#39;re already at the top of a you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.600" end="00:02:20.510" style="s2">know a stock market that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.980" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">about as high as it can be because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.510" end="00:02:25.910" style="s2">underlying economy is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:27.410" style="s2">unhealthy right the total percent of GDP</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.910" end="00:02:30.680" style="s2">that&#39;s going to debt servicing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.410" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">unsustainably high the wealth inequality</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.680" end="00:02:35.690" style="s2">is unsustainably disparate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:38.330" style="s2">basically a power-law distribution you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.690" end="00:02:39.560" style="s2">have a few companies that make up most</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.330" end="00:02:41.210" style="s2">of the success of the stock market</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.560" end="00:02:43.010" style="s2">because it&#39;s cap-weighted and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.210" end="00:02:47.210" style="s2">almost everything else pretty profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.010" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">lagging you have a totally unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.210" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">amount of total debt and all of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">resulted in the need for ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">quantitative easing and a negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:03:02.180" style="s2">yielding bond market and totally weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:03.860" style="s2">stuff with that right and so the markets</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.180" end="00:03:10.880" style="s2">not going to keep going up and staying</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:12.320" style="s2">that high forever anyways and so being</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.880" end="00:03:13.700" style="s2">able to have that foreknowledge and say</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.320" end="00:03:16.130" style="s2">now is a good time to sell these stocks</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.700" end="00:03:18.470" style="s2">and by the way let&#39;s actually short a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.130" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">bunch of stuff to make money as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.470" end="00:03:23.480" style="s2">market goes excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:27.530" style="s2">to make money as the market goes down</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.480" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">and then the value is gonna get really</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.530" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">low if if airlines can&#39;t fly the price</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">of airlines is gonna get really low but</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:34.670" style="s2">airlines are a real thing the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">gonna need the value of that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.670" end="00:03:38.870" style="s2">kind of evaporate so being able to buy</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:40.330" style="s2">it up at hugely discounted prices before</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.870" end="00:03:43.330" style="s2">it goes back up is pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.330" end="00:03:46.250" style="s2">opportunity to consolidate power and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.330" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">let&#39;s say that I have large pools of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.250" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">liquid capital and I haven&#39;t so I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:53.330" style="s2">family office or sovereign wealth fund</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">it has been hard to deploy that capital</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:57.770" style="s2">very effectively for a while because</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:03:59.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve got negative interest yielding you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.770" end="00:04:03.020" style="s2">know bond markets I can&#39;t just make</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.480" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">interest by sitting on it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.020" end="00:04:06.320" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t been huge volatility of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:08.540" style="s2">type that could be very effective and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.320" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">market stock market prices were high but</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.540" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">now you can deploy that capital very</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:14.630" style="s2">effectively by being able to buy up real</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:18.260" style="s2">valuable utilities at a very discounted</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.630" end="00:04:23.270" style="s2">price also if I am interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.260" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">increased surveillance capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.270" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">increased surveillance state or just</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">concentration of power of any kind when</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">things get worse people become more</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">willing to accept solutions that have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">some consequences and so I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">have to do anything to make it bad I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:46.290" style="s2">simply have to not make it better say</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">we&#39;re working on it and bureaucracies</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.290" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">are slow until we get to the position</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">that we actually have the capability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:56.190" style="s2">do something and so and if I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">advance a geopolitical agenda and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.190" end="00:04:59.010" style="s2">really want an alliance with these</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:01.950" style="s2">countries who are currently allied</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">somewhere else and I can just to help</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.950" end="00:05:06.770" style="s2">the situation break those alliances like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:09.630" style="s2">all of those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.770" end="00:05:11.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying anyone did anything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.630" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">saying that these are reasonable things</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.820" end="00:05:19.550" style="s2">to understand that there&#39;s an incentive</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">landscape for right now someone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.550" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">people who own hedge funds or large</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">pools of capital they had the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">intelligence of what was happening could</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:31.050" style="s2">they if they wanted to maximally help</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">and you know try to start engaging</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.050" end="00:05:35.250" style="s2">solutions and trying to use some of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">money to influence governments to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.250" end="00:05:40.290" style="s2">hey let&#39;s actually put these travel bans</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">on sooner and let&#39;s start getting tests</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:44.640" style="s2">gets rolled out and PPE distributed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:48.090" style="s2">etc of course they could and they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.640" end="00:05:50.970" style="s2">say it&#39;s not their job and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.090" end="00:05:53.790" style="s2">their job right their job is to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.970" end="00:05:55.470" style="s2">return for the assets under management</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.790" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">for their shareholders which they do a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">very good job of do I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:02.280" style="s2">conspiracy do I think they intended the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">virus no but I think that their</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.280" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">incentive is to do predatory opportunism</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">more than it is to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.220" end="00:06:22.790" style="s2">I think the vast majority of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.990" end="00:06:27.660" style="s2">seeing is just predatory opportunism I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.790" end="00:06:31.980" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s all just that and so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.660" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">you think about the power law</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.980" end="00:06:38.010" style="s2">distribution of wealth you have a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:39.960" style="s2">actors who have really just a small</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.010" end="00:06:42.090" style="s2">number like if you look at the House of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.960" end="00:06:44.670" style="s2">Saud and the House of Rothschild and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.090" end="00:06:47.790" style="s2">Putin&#39;s personal wealth it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.670" end="00:06:52.680" style="s2">like way above everybody else&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.790" end="00:06:54.420" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got like a small but</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.680" end="00:06:56.790" style="s2">larger said of a hundred billionaire&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.420" end="00:07:00.150" style="s2">and and then it you know kind of Falls</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.790" end="00:07:01.590" style="s2">deeply in the same way that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.150" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">power-law distribution and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:07.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a power-law distribution in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">geopolitical power and in hybrid warfare</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.290" end="00:07:13.950" style="s2">power and so the few actors that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:15.510" style="s2">the most asymmetric capacity habit by</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:04.029" style="s2">say which group it is but it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.189" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">find out vitamin C is not a placebo</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.029" end="00:10:10.759" style="s2">vitamin C is extremely well established</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:21.379" style="s2">that late stage wouldn&#39;t be effective</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.199" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">anyways so maybe that&#39;s just a dumb</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.379" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">study maybe it&#39;s just a badly designed</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:32.089" style="s2">study but if I wanted to say look Trump</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:33.649" style="s2">was an idiot or I wanted to say see this</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.089" end="00:10:35.179" style="s2">generic drug we can&#39;t make any money on</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.649" end="00:10:35.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so this other drug or</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.520" end="00:10:45.580" style="s2">out looking like science but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.380" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">actually not science because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:34.450" style="s2">that can decide what policy should be or</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.520" end="00:11:36.040" style="s2">control public opinion then the power of</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:52.780" style="s2">no problem seeing this in retrospect</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:56.050" style="s2">right we have no problem seeing the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.780" end="00:12:00.780" style="s2">that priestly Authority during the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.050" end="00:12:04.330" style="s2">Middle Ages was very influenced by the</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:15.640" style="s2">that comes from a religious source or a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.000" end="00:12:17.589" style="s2">science source or a one thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.640" end="00:12:19.420" style="s2">learn about science and this was this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.589" end="00:12:23.709" style="s2">kind of a postmodern of critique but not</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.420" end="00:12:26.740" style="s2">quite because there there&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.709" end="00:12:30.330" style="s2">earnest way to take it the more complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.740" end="00:12:32.830" style="s2">this physical system the easier it is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.330" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">very different answers based on how you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.830" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">set up the study and so the larger the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.810" end="00:12:42.279" style="s2">data set is the easier it is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">cherry-pick data that supports whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.279" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">I want where it&#39;s actually not lying</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just cherry-picked but similarly if</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:50.570" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:53.310" style="s2">something as complex as a cell or a body</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.310" end="00:12:57.990" style="s2">that is relevant to that thing right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.290" end="00:12:59.490" style="s2">I can say well this particular biometric</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.990" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">went up and that&#39;s a measure of health</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.490" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">there might be plenty of other</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">measures of illness or that went down</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">they aren&#39;t even things that we look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.100" end="00:13:16.490" style="s2">in the study and so I can do info</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.490" end="00:13:20.370" style="s2">because I can say what is the thing that</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.269" end="00:13:52.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.339" end="00:13:54.630" style="s2">and as the situation gets more complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.440" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">the more so so basic physical chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.630" end="00:13:59.399" style="s2">inside of a beaker or how a transistor</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:05.850" style="s2">works is very very different than how a</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.010" end="00:15:17.240" style="s2">would have evolved into being in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.450" end="00:15:17.240" style="s2">relationship with bats and other things</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.270" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">do I think that 5g causes coronavirus no</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.230" end="00:15:28.170" style="s2">do I think people who have covin</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.750" end="00:15:33.810" style="s2">symptoms are really some other thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.170" end="00:15:36.150" style="s2">caused by 5g no the lope if you do look</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.810" end="00:15:39.540" style="s2">at a map of the distribution of 5g and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.150" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">map of the distribution of SARS or of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">excuse me of Cove in nineteen they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:48.330" style="s2">match there are areas that have 5g that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:49.770" style="s2">were not terribly hit and their areas</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.330" end="00:15:54.300" style="s2">that were terribly hit that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.770" end="00:15:56.520" style="s2">5g so I saw a number of studies that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.300" end="00:15:58.830" style="s2">rolled out but not studies like memes</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.520" end="00:16:00.570" style="s2">they rolled out that said look here the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.830" end="00:16:02.820" style="s2">places that were hit and these were all</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.570" end="00:16:04.340" style="s2">a month after 5g was installed or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.820" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">first place have typed year whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.340" end="00:16:09.150" style="s2">they were just actually wrong like when</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">I went and looked at it they there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.150" end="00:16:13.650" style="s2">some pretty compelling so I&#39;m like wow</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">if that&#39;s true it was not true and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.650" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">this is just like basic fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.340" end="00:16:27.000" style="s2">do I think that there are companies that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.820" end="00:16:29.190" style="s2">are extremely powerful companies that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.000" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">are extremely focused on rolling 5g out</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.190" end="00:16:36.180" style="s2">yes I think Huawei and Verizon in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:43.460" style="s2">particular some other ones have very</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.180" end="00:16:46.290" style="s2">deep investment in 5g do I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.460" end="00:16:50.460" style="s2">the safety of it is well enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.290" end="00:16:52.850" style="s2">established to roll it out no but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.460" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">think that on some of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.850" end="00:16:57.750" style="s2">wireless communication - and I also</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:01.380" style="s2">think it on the cumulative load of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.750" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">total thing so the fact that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.380" end="00:17:05.100" style="s2">ionizing radiation is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:07.440" style="s2">relevant saying yes that means that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.100" end="00:17:11.430" style="s2">not like acutely causing you cancer like</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.440" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">a microwave but it&#39;s signals</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.790" end="00:17:33.870" style="s2">should it be on the burden of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.230" end="00:17:35.550" style="s2">activists to prove that it&#39;s unsafe or</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.870" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">the burden of the telecom companies to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.550" end="00:17:39.210" style="s2">prove that it&#39;s safe before being rolled</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:43.560" style="s2">out the burden of proof should</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.210" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">absolutely be on proving safety do we</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.560" end="00:17:46.890" style="s2">need it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.190" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">no we don&#39;t need it well we need it for</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.890" end="00:17:53.150" style="s2">the economy to grow know the gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.070" end="00:17:56.750" style="s2">do we need it because we need an IOT</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.150" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">connected smart city world that fast no</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.750" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">do we like fast shit and like we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.020" end="00:18:06.660" style="s2">get to self-driving cars whatever yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:08.520" style="s2">we totally do now is 5g based on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.660" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">frequency bands and everything going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.520" end="00:18:19.290" style="s2">be more dangerous or not than 4G haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:22.230" style="s2">done the studies I haven&#39;t to know I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.290" end="00:18:24.810" style="s2">say that just intuitively I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.230" end="00:18:26.550" style="s2">concerns about it and I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.810" end="00:18:30.090" style="s2">once it&#39;s rolled out it&#39;ll be impossible</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.550" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">to do proper studies because you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:32.940" style="s2">be able to isolate it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:34.230" style="s2">you won&#39;t be able to get to environments</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">where it&#39;s not without changing your</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.230" end="00:18:37.890" style="s2">whole life so much so you&#39;ve changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.650" style="s2">enough other variables that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.890" end="00:18:44.280" style="s2">say like oh yes when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.650" end="00:18:46.770" style="s2">Arctic Circle your health issues change</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.280" end="00:18:48.600" style="s2">but was that because now you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.770" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">pristine environment air wise or water</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.600" end="00:18:57.620" style="s2">wise or different sun or and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">I would much rather that we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.620" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">the right kinds of safety studies up</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:05.880" style="s2">front that weren&#39;t only looking at acute</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:08.250" style="s2">effects but chronic effects this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.880" end="00:19:14.490" style="s2">something that I&#39;m very upset about our</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.250" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">entire medical paradigm is the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.490" end="00:19:21.810" style="s2">toxicity in general and deficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:25.290" style="s2">nutrients and pathogenicity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.810" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">infection we don&#39;t look at chronic</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:34.140" style="s2">so we have a clinical definition of okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:36.420" style="s2">here is you have a you have a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.140" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">vitamin D deficiency right you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.420" end="00:19:39.870" style="s2">got rickets well here&#39;s the level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.760" end="00:19:41.640" style="s2">rickets or you you have a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.870" end="00:19:43.770" style="s2">vitamin C deficiency you have scurvy</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.640" end="00:19:45.630" style="s2">well pretty much nobody gets Kerby right</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.770" end="00:19:47.850" style="s2">like you have to be in some fucked up</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.630" end="00:19:49.650" style="s2">food situation you get scurvy which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.850" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">why there are still a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.650" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">mainstream doctors who say you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:56.660" style="s2">need supplements and nobody really needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:59.040" style="s2">vitamin C or vitamin D or whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.660" end="00:20:01.320" style="s2">but then you have what is the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.040" end="00:20:03.000" style="s2">level for human thriving and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.320" end="00:20:04.500" style="s2">healthiest people with the healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.000" end="00:20:07.580" style="s2">diets and there&#39;s a pretty big range</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.500" end="00:20:11.190" style="s2">between the optimal level and scurvy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.580" end="00:20:13.380" style="s2">if you&#39;re here your Doc&#39;s are gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.190" end="00:20:16.140" style="s2">you&#39;re not deficient but you might</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">actually be and but the deficiency means</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.140" end="00:20:21.300" style="s2">you are now acutely dying right you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:23.630" style="s2">in an acute death process directly</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.300" end="00:20:26.370" style="s2">related to this one identifiable thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.630" end="00:20:28.110" style="s2">but above that you might be in a you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.370" end="00:20:29.850" style="s2">will probably live less long and have</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.110" end="00:20:31.470" style="s2">increased susceptibility to different</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.850" end="00:20:32.940" style="s2">kinds of diseases but you&#39;ll never be</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.470" end="00:20:34.710" style="s2">able to track it to this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.940" end="00:20:37.020" style="s2">your sub clinical level of vitamin C</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.710" end="00:20:38.940" style="s2">plus a vitamin D plus of a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.020" end="00:20:41.580" style="s2">other things plus of toxicities plus of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.940" end="00:20:43.830" style="s2">whatever right is basically just sub</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.380" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">be able to say this was a necessary and</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">just a broken model which is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.770" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">in modern medicine were quite good at</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:08.190" style="s2">solving acute causation things if</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.429" style="s2">like how do we advance new things where</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.540" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">the negative effects might be very</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.429" end="00:22:19.290" style="s2">causally delayed but then this is where</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:21.960" style="s2">we also have to think about risk and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.290" end="00:22:23.640" style="s2">necessity and things like that so do I</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.960" end="00:22:26.250" style="s2">think that the safety studies that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.640" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">done are based on the wrong model of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.250" end="00:22:33.570" style="s2">safety yes I think it&#39;s the wrong model</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">of safety now do I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.570" end="00:22:39.929" style="s2">that 5g is a mind control system to kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:42.450" style="s2">of brown noise everybody&#39;s mind and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.929" end="00:22:45.990" style="s2">activate vaccine implanted nano chips</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.450" end="00:22:49.350" style="s2">and whatever I&#39;ve never I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.990" end="00:22:51.300" style="s2">interesting idea if there was any group</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.350" end="00:22:52.679" style="s2">that was actually that well coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.300" end="00:22:56.040" style="s2">and powerful that would also be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.679" end="00:22:58.470" style="s2">interesting I have never seen any</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.040" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">evidence that is compelling when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.470" end="00:23:02.220" style="s2">followed some of those rabbit holes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.990" style="s2">the evidence that I have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">find is not compelling that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.990" end="00:23:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not true right I&#39;m not closing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.440" style="s2">door on that&#39;s for sure not true maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.160" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">there are reptilians running shit but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.440" end="00:23:16.130" style="s2">have no evidence to believe so and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:16.130" style="s2">seems exceedingly</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.300" end="00:23:30.200" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.930" end="00:23:33.510" style="s2">interesting thing to do is to look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.200" end="00:23:35.460" style="s2">declassified documents of things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.510" end="00:23:36.810" style="s2">were conspiracy theories in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.460" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">now we actually know happen because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.810" end="00:23:44.430" style="s2">documents got Declassified and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:46.590" style="s2">know there were several in the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.430" end="00:23:52.500" style="s2">area the Gulf of Tonkin is a very famous</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.590" end="00:23:53.820" style="s2">one but also the firing torpedoes into</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.500" end="00:23:55.970" style="s2">the water and saying that we had sank</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.820" end="00:24:00.110" style="s2">Vietnamese ships to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.970" end="00:24:04.590" style="s2">escalation for the war and things about</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.110" end="00:24:07.500" style="s2">operation Mockingbird Operation</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:09.740" style="s2">Paperclip COINTELPRO there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.500" end="00:24:11.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of things that are now</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.740" end="00:24:18.360" style="s2">Declassified because those people all</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.670" end="00:24:19.830" style="s2">died and we&#39;re during the time that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.360" end="00:24:21.210" style="s2">was still happening anyone who said</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.830" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">anything about it would be a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.210" end="00:24:29.070" style="s2">nut and so and similarly when when the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">USSR fell there was a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.070" end="00:24:33.000" style="s2">Declassified stuff that came out in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:34.830" style="s2">Baltic States I have a friend that runs</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:36.120" style="s2">a private intelligence company who went</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.830" end="00:24:38.310" style="s2">to Yugoslavia and pulled the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.120" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">intelligence records then and looked at</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.310" end="00:24:45.030" style="s2">the way that the KGB built their system</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:46.290" style="s2">of DSM to be able to classify anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.030" end="00:24:48.990" style="s2">that went against the state as a mental</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.290" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">illness and it was like very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.990" end="00:24:54.390" style="s2">documented how they did it and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:56.520" style="s2">behind it and the whole thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.390" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">way that J Edgar Hoover was targeting</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.520" end="00:24:59.640" style="s2">the Black Panthers not like that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:01.110" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been known except that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.640" end="00:25:06.330" style="s2">know people broke in and found the shit</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.110" end="00:25:10.620" style="s2">right so does that stuff happen yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.330" end="00:25:13.940" style="s2">course it happens and it happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.620" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">public sector meaning government</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.940" end="00:25:19.410" style="s2">intelligence agencies you know military</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.720" style="s2">it also happens in the private sector</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.410" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">right so for when you see the Enron type</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.720" end="00:25:25.110" style="s2">things for every Enron there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:27.090" style="s2">those that happen all the time they just</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.110" end="00:25:29.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t caught and for every Madoff and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.090" end="00:25:29.270" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">that said most of the common conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.500" end="00:25:47.260" style="s2">theories that I see are things that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.010" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">can&#39;t find any good grounding for and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.260" end="00:25:56.830" style="s2">they&#39;re like many of them tend to be far</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:26:00.260" style="s2">more fantastical then just the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.830" end="00:26:02.539" style="s2">typical social science of yes of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.260" end="00:26:04.580" style="s2">groups with really big budgets probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.539" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">have more advanced tech than is publicly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.580" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">known about and yes of course for</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:12.649" style="s2">national security purposes some should</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:15.380" style="s2">is kept secret and they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.649" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">engaged in war and preparation for war</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.380" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">and so and yes like the people that get</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">to the top of power stacks get there by</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:27.110" style="s2">being good at getting to the top of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:28.549" style="s2">power stacks and that means a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.110" end="00:26:31.090" style="s2">things psychologically in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.549" end="00:26:33.380" style="s2">disposition because there will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.090" end="00:26:35.029" style="s2">sociopaths that will want to overturn</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.380" end="00:26:37.010" style="s2">them and they will only not get</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.029" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">overturned by the draconian measures of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.010" end="00:26:40.820" style="s2">the sociopaths if they are better at</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.490" style="s2">being able to play that game than they</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.820" end="00:26:46.279" style="s2">are you know we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.490" end="00:26:48.890" style="s2">conspiracy as a function of the system</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.279" end="00:26:50.809" style="s2">incentives right whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.890" end="00:26:53.390" style="s2">system incentivizes creates a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.809" end="00:26:55.659" style="s2">topology and the people just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.390" end="00:26:58.580" style="s2">move within the shape of that topology</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.659" end="00:27:01.010" style="s2">but then they in turn shape the topology</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.580" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a reinforcing thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.010" end="00:27:06.440" style="s2">and one of the problems is that like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:10.010" style="s2">sociopaths and sadists are a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.440" end="00:27:12.169" style="s2">and people who are not that actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:13.970" style="s2">have a hard time believing that because</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.169" end="00:27:15.470" style="s2">they have empathy and they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.970" end="00:27:17.000" style="s2">empathizing with what it must be like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.470" end="00:27:18.529" style="s2">be someone else so they&#39;re getting wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.000" end="00:27:20.179" style="s2">they have a hard time putting themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.529" end="00:27:22.039" style="s2">in the position of someone who&#39;s inner</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.179" end="00:27:25.490" style="s2">experiences is different from theirs as</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.039" end="00:27:28.490" style="s2">it actually is but you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.490" end="00:27:30.350" style="s2">look at cluster B disorders there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">whole set of disorders that are oriented</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.350" end="00:27:38.149" style="s2">to power and including abuses of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:39.799" style="s2">so there are not one for one and perfect</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.149" end="00:27:40.970" style="s2">not every time but statistical</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.799" end="00:27:43.490" style="s2">correlation with</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.970" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">of high power and psychologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.490" end="00:27:47.240" style="s2">oriented to who want that and that means</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:49.730" style="s2">also differential an asymmetric power</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.240" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">meaning use increased power over others</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.730" end="00:27:57.740" style="s2">to continue to grow and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:59.960" style="s2">asymmetric power it&#39;s funny how easy it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.740" end="00:28:02.169" style="s2">is to see throughout history right like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.960" end="00:28:04.309" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at Genghis Khan or</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.169" end="00:28:06.289" style="s2">Alexander the Great or Napoleon or</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.309" end="00:28:07.490" style="s2">whatever we&#39;re like oh yeah the those</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.289" end="00:28:10.370" style="s2">guys just went and killed fucking</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.490" end="00:28:11.750" style="s2">everybody right and yet then we look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.370" end="00:28:13.429" style="s2">the people who are most powerful today</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.750" end="00:28:17.030" style="s2">they&#39;re genetically the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.429" end="00:28:20.510" style="s2">people who and we have a situation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.030" end="00:28:21.799" style="s2">in some ways seems more civil but also</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.510" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">in some ways just because we hide it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.799" end="00:28:27.710" style="s2">better you know like we had a nice</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.510" style="s2">Democrat and present presidency in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.710" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">US and we drone strike to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.510" end="00:28:43.990" style="s2">civilians and for very questionable</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:43.990" style="s2">actual motives and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.409" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">factory farms are as gruesome as</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.760" end="00:28:52.610" style="s2">anything that was done in the Dark Ages</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:54.770" style="s2">at a massive scale that almost everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.610" end="00:28:58.700" style="s2">watching this is paying to make that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.770" end="00:29:00.980" style="s2">happen right so it&#39;s like oh I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.700" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">kill her I pay the hit man okay you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.980" end="00:29:05.179" style="s2">fucking paid to have the wet works done</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.679" style="s2">well buying something comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.179" end="00:29:08.179" style="s2">factory farm is that right you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.679" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">paying someone else to do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.179" end="00:29:16.520" style="s2">gruesome what works and so the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:18.200" style="s2">say this is because I want to see us</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.520" end="00:29:22.039" style="s2">emerge into the higher angels of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.200" end="00:29:24.440" style="s2">nature but we can only do that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.039" end="00:29:26.179" style="s2">also face the reality of the total set</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.440" end="00:29:29.299" style="s2">of things that the human experience does</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.179" end="00:29:30.980" style="s2">and specifically some of the uglier</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.980" end="00:29:42.679" style="s2">to power that ends up getting and now</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.070" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">one can also take that too far take that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.679" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">as a general set of principles and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:49.419" style="s2">assume that everyone in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:52.890" style="s2">power is a child eating say this</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.419" end="00:29:55.050" style="s2">Satanist which would also be silly</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.890" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">and this is one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.050" end="00:30:01.500" style="s2">find with regard to conspiracy is I find</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:04.170" style="s2">that people have an aesthetic bias where</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.500" end="00:30:07.110" style="s2">anything they hear as a conspiracy they</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.170" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">either just kind of reject it up front</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.110" end="00:30:10.800" style="s2">off fucking tinfoil hat conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:12.420" style="s2">theorists they just automatically</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.800" end="00:30:13.950" style="s2">without studying it even though history</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.420" end="00:30:16.620" style="s2">shows how much people have conspired</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.950" end="00:30:18.270" style="s2">just meaning some people share info with</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.620" end="00:30:19.650" style="s2">each other to advance shared agendas</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.270" end="00:30:22.110" style="s2">without sharing it with the public and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.650" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">sharing some disinfo you can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.110" end="00:30:25.770" style="s2">Sun Tzu and read about this info and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.330" end="00:30:27.980" style="s2">to do this info right like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.770" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">doing that for a thousand years pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.980" end="00:30:35.970" style="s2">intelligently and coordinated Lee and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:38.100" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how easy it is for</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.970" end="00:30:39.390" style="s2">people to reject something as oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.100" end="00:30:42.420" style="s2">dumb conspiracy thinking when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.390" end="00:30:44.160" style="s2">actually study history then on the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.420" end="00:30:45.930" style="s2">hand there are people who if they hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.160" end="00:30:48.030" style="s2">any conspiracy they assume it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.930" end="00:30:50.850" style="s2">true and if they hear that anything came</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.030" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">from a authoritative institution they</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.850" end="00:30:54.660" style="s2">assume it&#39;s probably corrupt and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:55.920" style="s2">also completely silly because if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.660" end="00:30:57.150" style="s2">groups were that corrupt they would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.920" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">overturned like if they were that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.150" end="00:31:02.160" style="s2">completely in whole-cell corrupt or is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:04.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a balance of that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.160" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">evilness that gets them there it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.200" end="00:31:07.770" style="s2">effectiveness at a lot of things right</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.720" style="s2">it is actually the ability to produce</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.770" end="00:31:11.490" style="s2">and manage and do logistics and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.720" end="00:31:14.790" style="s2">ability to win power games it&#39;s a mix of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.490" end="00:31:16.560" style="s2">those things right so is everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.790" end="00:31:18.300" style="s2">coming out of a major university or</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.560" end="00:31:22.410" style="s2">major institution or you know government</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.300" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">regulatory body a lying conspiracy no is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.410" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">a lot of it at least highly influenced</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.920" style="s2">yeah does that mean that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:33.960" style="s2">people who are involved even no no of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.920" end="00:31:38.430" style="s2">course not most of the people involved</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.960" end="00:31:40.200" style="s2">are just doing their job and they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.430" end="00:31:42.180" style="s2">told to research this so they&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">good job of doing honest research on</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.180" end="00:31:44.940" style="s2">this now the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:46.530" style="s2">researching this as opposed to this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.940" end="00:31:48.210" style="s2">that there&#39;s an agenda as to why to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.530" end="00:31:51.500" style="s2">research this as opposed to that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.210" end="00:31:51.500" style="s2">will never even know that that agenda</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.650" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">what this means though is that almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.180" end="00:32:03.330" style="s2">everyone lives in in a topology that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.620" style="s2">you know like what do I do for job</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.330" end="00:32:06.120" style="s2">protection there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.620" end="00:32:06.390" style="s2">like there&#39;s stuff I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.120" end="00:32:07.920" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.390" end="00:32:09.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll lose my job there&#39;s certain stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.920" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">have to say and I have to do to just</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.810" end="00:32:13.080" style="s2">keep my job I got to take care of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:14.850" style="s2">family so whatever it is even if it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.080" end="00:32:16.170" style="s2">seems kind of unethical or asshole ish</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.850" end="00:32:18.360" style="s2">or not the thing I&#39;d most like to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.170" end="00:32:22.920" style="s2">it&#39;s office policy or whatever so just</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.360" end="00:32:26.940" style="s2">for job security and then for promotion</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.920" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">and for ladder climbing I am gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.940" end="00:32:31.260" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s effective within that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:33.510" style="s2">space so basically the incentives and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.260" end="00:32:35.580" style="s2">the disincentives the topology of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.510" end="00:32:39.660" style="s2">space is going to inform my action as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.580" end="00:32:43.050" style="s2">average agent in that space but some</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.660" end="00:32:48.540" style="s2">people have asymmetric influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.050" end="00:32:49.860" style="s2">architecture of those topologies and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.540" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">one of the things that I think most</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.860" end="00:32:54.540" style="s2">people don&#39;t think about enough is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:57.390" style="s2">a relatively small amount of fairly</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.540" end="00:33:00.330" style="s2">sociopathic people can create topologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.390" end="00:33:03.930" style="s2">that lots of otherwise not sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.330" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">people will participate in towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.930" end="00:33:16.040" style="s2">relatively sociopathic results so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:19.110" style="s2">say that profit becomes a motive for war</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.040" end="00:33:21.890" style="s2">if you study history again the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.110" end="00:33:24.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a thing becomes pretty clear and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.890" end="00:33:26.190" style="s2">when you look at the size that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.050" end="00:33:28.050" style="s2">military-industrial complex is out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.190" end="00:33:29.190" style="s2">the total economic bloc and the size of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.050" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">the government contracts it gets</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.190" end="00:33:33.060" style="s2">compared to other areas whenever the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:35.250" style="s2">fact that if the demand went away the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.060" end="00:33:37.830" style="s2">the profit of the supply side would go</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.250" end="00:33:39.810" style="s2">away and it is actually the fiduciary</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.830" end="00:33:44.850" style="s2">responsibility of all business owners to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.810" end="00:33:46.440" style="s2">continue to manufacture demand we can go</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.850" end="00:33:47.970" style="s2">back and historically look at cases</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.440" end="00:33:49.560" style="s2">right we can look at gulf of tonkin or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.970" end="00:33:52.260" style="s2">whatever where there were false flag</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.560" end="00:33:54.090" style="s2">events for whatever motives so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.260" end="00:33:55.920" style="s2">there&#39;s some fucked up motives that some</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.090" end="00:33:57.690" style="s2">very small number of people have that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.920" end="00:33:58.950" style="s2">end up influencing other people and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.690" end="00:34:01.560" style="s2">other people are not necessarily even</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:06.300" style="s2">aware of what those motives are the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.560" end="00:34:08.490" style="s2">soldier who is in the battlefield isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.300" end="00:34:10.169" style="s2">fighting for financial interest who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.490" end="00:34:13.470" style="s2">risking his life and making a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.169" end="00:34:17.790" style="s2">low wage but he still might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.470" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">something that is when he is involved in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.790" end="00:34:21.990" style="s2">the in the bombing or the whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:24.030" style="s2">still might be killing civilians for</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.990" end="00:34:25.260" style="s2">Wars it should never be fought and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.030" end="00:34:28.350" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t even know that right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.260" end="00:34:31.010" style="s2">he&#39;s engaged in an overall in activity</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.350" end="00:34:33.810" style="s2">that we could call sociopathic activity</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.010" end="00:34:36.419" style="s2">for non sociopathic reasons personally</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.810" end="00:34:37.800" style="s2">and we can see the same thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.419" end="00:34:41.540" style="s2">corporate world we can see the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.800" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">thing in all over the place this was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.540" end="00:34:46.859" style="s2">SS troupe who were being tried in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.310" end="00:34:49.020" style="s2">Nuremberg trials and how many of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.859" end="00:34:50.730" style="s2">said no we actually didn&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.020" end="00:34:52.500" style="s2">everything we were doing was good it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.730" end="00:34:53.850" style="s2">started out with some ideological stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.500" end="00:34:54.869" style="s2">and then it got really fucked up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:34:56.909" style="s2">then when they were asked did you tried</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.869" end="00:34:58.650" style="s2">to stop no and they all repeated the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.909" end="00:35:00.170" style="s2">same German phrases that basically said</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.650" end="00:35:04.890" style="s2">officers orders we didn&#39;t have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.170" end="00:35:07.109" style="s2">and so this property by which so yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.890" end="00:35:10.859" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody does a really fucked-up</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.109" end="00:35:12.330" style="s2">thing they don&#39;t even make it obvious or</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.859" end="00:35:14.609" style="s2">they have some fucked-up motives and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.330" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">they create a set of office policies or</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.609" end="00:35:17.850" style="s2">command and control policies or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:19.859" style="s2">it is and everyone else just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.850" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">doing their job and they&#39;re even usually</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.859" end="00:35:23.310" style="s2">told something that what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">is valorous or good right scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.310" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">are told they&#39;re doing this for one</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.130" style="s2">reason and then it is used for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:34.500" style="s2">weaponized purpose inside of military or</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.130" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">whatever and then there&#39;s also that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">one actor is developing a new weapon all</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:40.470" style="s2">the other actors have to develop the new</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">weapon plus counter weapons there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.470" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">arms race side so both of those are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">situations in which bad actors are</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.240" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">capable of effecting a incentive</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:51.480" style="s2">landscape that affects lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:53.550" style="s2">actors one of the things we will need</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.480" end="00:35:56.550" style="s2">for an effective civilization is a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.550" end="00:35:58.410" style="s2">to be able to bind bad actors quickly</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.550" end="00:36:00.300" style="s2">which will require that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.510" style="s2">as opposed to just pendulum dowsing or</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.510" end="00:37:33.620" style="s2">are there certain kinds of processes</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.400" end="00:37:35.210" style="s2">that will give increased certainty to be</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.010" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">absolutely perfect certainty no because</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.260" end="00:37:46.520" style="s2">I can&#39;t rule out unknown unknowns but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:48.050" style="s2">can certainly say I have enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.520" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">certainty to inform right action here</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.050" end="00:37:52.700" style="s2">and so people having a mature</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:54.200" style="s2">relationship with certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.700" end="00:37:57.080" style="s2">uncertainty is that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.200" end="00:37:58.520" style="s2">uncomfortable with either there are a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.080" end="00:38:00.620" style="s2">lot of people who have been trained up</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.520" end="00:38:01.790" style="s2">in more of a postmodernist camp we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.620" end="00:38:06.020" style="s2">actually very uncomfortable with any</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.790" end="00:38:08.750" style="s2">certainties even relative ones and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.020" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">you know the assumption that all</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.750" end="00:38:14.090" style="s2">certainties probably imperialism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:17.030" style="s2">probably someone gonna try and force</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.090" end="00:38:18.710" style="s2">they&#39;re not Universal proof as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.030" end="00:38:21.470" style="s2">Universal under the name of science on</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.710" end="00:38:24.060" style="s2">everybody or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.470" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot we can say with pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.060" end="00:38:28.470" style="s2">high certainty about the molecular</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:31.080" style="s2">properties of water there really just is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">or the speed of sound or a lot a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.080" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">things that are pretty well-established</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:39.619" style="s2">they&#39;re very useful and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:42.810" style="s2">know like Dawkins says here rightly</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.619" end="00:38:45.830" style="s2">planes actually work whether you believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.810" end="00:38:51.480" style="s2">in them or not and there&#39;s a there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.830" end="00:38:57.330" style="s2">reality to the mechanisms in those</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.480" end="00:38:59.880" style="s2">domains so it&#39;s important to be not only</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.330" end="00:39:02.070" style="s2">able to have certainty where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:03.900" style="s2">warranted but to seek it to seek</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.070" end="00:39:06.270" style="s2">basically better and better</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.900" end="00:39:10.410" style="s2">understanding of reality to inform more</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.270" end="00:39:12.510" style="s2">responsible choice making but in order</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.410" end="00:39:13.980" style="s2">to do that I&#39;ve got to ignore I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.510" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">to admit and acknowledge and be</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.980" end="00:39:17.970" style="s2">comfortable with the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:19.859" style="s2">uncertainty that&#39;s there so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.970" end="00:39:21.690" style="s2">assess where I&#39;m currently at and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.859" end="00:39:26.609" style="s2">the appropriate process to come to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.690" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">enough certainty to act is so I see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.609" end="00:39:30.390" style="s2">same weird certainty on both the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:34.190" style="s2">conspiracy theorists and the anti</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.390" end="00:39:37.560" style="s2">conspiracy theorists like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.190" end="00:39:41.099" style="s2">in-group thing where one is it would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.560" end="00:39:44.580" style="s2">so bad for my in-group if I was part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.099" end="00:39:48.780" style="s2">the critical thinking anti conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:51.000" style="s2">camp and I started saying you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.780" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">there really is such and such that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.000" end="00:39:56.210" style="s2">there&#39;s pretty strong incentives other</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">than just clear thinking against it</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.210" end="00:40:00.270" style="s2">there&#39;s also other kinds of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">biases that we can talk about that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.270" end="00:40:10.650" style="s2">actually pretty important aliens I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:13.730" style="s2">fuckin know that I have seen some</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.650" end="00:40:19.859" style="s2">evidence that I find quite compelling of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.730" end="00:40:25.470" style="s2">some things I have seen enough video</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.859" end="00:40:29.910" style="s2">evidence of objects moving and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.470" end="00:40:31.950" style="s2">particularly declassified military stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.910" end="00:40:33.060" style="s2">not just the recent tik-tok but lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.950" end="00:40:36.620" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.060" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">that do acute angles at speed which</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.620" end="00:40:42.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go along with the nurse as we</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:44.280" style="s2">understand it maybe it&#39;s just a hologram</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.020" end="00:40:45.720" style="s2">which would make sense right because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.280" end="00:40:48.060" style="s2">hologram can do that or maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.720" end="00:40:49.740" style="s2">plasma being moved around by e/m field</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.060" end="00:40:51.780" style="s2">or something or some kind of directed</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.740" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">energy weapon thing maybe it is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.780" end="00:40:57.810" style="s2">kind of physical ship maybe I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">but it when you look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.810" end="00:41:03.390" style="s2">the disclosure project and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:05.940" style="s2">military officials very senior rear</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.390" end="00:41:07.740" style="s2">Admirals and four-star generals and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.940" end="00:41:09.660" style="s2">whatever they came forward and described</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.740" end="00:41:11.910" style="s2">the experience that they had with</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.660" end="00:41:14.040" style="s2">unidentified objects objects that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.910" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">couldn&#39;t identify is that compelling</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.040" end="00:41:18.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s totally compelling for me that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:21.030" style="s2">there is that many of them describing</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.360" end="00:41:22.260" style="s2">some kinds of phenomena does that mean I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.030" end="00:41:26.970" style="s2">get to jump to knowing what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.260" end="00:41:28.320" style="s2">phenomena are nope does that mean there</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.970" end="00:41:31.500" style="s2">are aliens or there aren&#39;t aliens I</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.320" end="00:41:34.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know but I I neither feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.500" end="00:41:36.840" style="s2">comfortable saying I for sure have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.200" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">clear sense that it is or I can for sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.840" end="00:41:42.120" style="s2">rule it out I can say that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:45.630" style="s2">people who understand how to read radar</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.120" end="00:41:47.190" style="s2">and who understand as fighter pilots or</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.630" end="00:41:49.590" style="s2">astronauts or whatever how to identify</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.190" end="00:41:51.390" style="s2">the types of man-made objects in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.590" end="00:41:55.020" style="s2">have seen a lot of things they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.390" end="00:42:00.030" style="s2">identify did seem earnest as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.020" end="00:42:01.680" style="s2">just lay dumb people so that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.030" end="00:42:03.420" style="s2">fascinating for me but I&#39;m comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.680" end="00:42:05.130" style="s2">enough with uncertainty to leave it at</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.420" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">fascinating and say if I could figure</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.130" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">out where I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.780" end="00:42:16.080" style="s2">do I think that there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.040" end="00:42:18.330" style="s2">are airing on the side of unfounded</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.080" end="00:42:20.940" style="s2">conspiracy theories and more of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.330" end="00:42:23.310" style="s2">together and with more certain teams yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.940" end="00:42:25.020" style="s2">definitely do I think there are also</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.310" end="00:42:27.230" style="s2">other people airing on the side of being</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.020" end="00:42:30.180" style="s2">comfortable with more authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.230" end="00:42:32.070" style="s2">like the exact opposite side it totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.180" end="00:42:37.170" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be that are actually under</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.070" end="00:42:38.370" style="s2">paranoid about what the true authorities</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.170" end="00:42:40.500" style="s2">are telling them and how they will</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.370" end="00:42:42.060" style="s2">handle things yeah I totally think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:46.860" style="s2">both of those are happening nearly</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.060" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">equally and equally concerning lis no</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.860" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">I&#39;m actually more concerned by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:53.460" style="s2">second one honestly I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:55.530" style="s2">a problem with people saying that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.460" end="00:42:57.390" style="s2">think that there isn&#39;t really a virus</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.530" end="00:43:00.540" style="s2">they can absolutely fuck up endemic up</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.390" end="00:43:04.470" style="s2">of that belief but I think the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.540" end="00:43:06.570" style="s2">people who call for national security</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.470" end="00:43:09.960" style="s2">actions to solve this that leave</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.570" end="00:43:11.670" style="s2">authority states also creates a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.960" end="00:43:13.740" style="s2">that could be worse than the virus I</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.670" end="00:43:17.130" style="s2">think there&#39;s another reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.740" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">are kind of having that increasing sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.130" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2">is that there are a lot of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.250" end="00:43:24.510" style="s2">authoritarian measures happening which</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.070" end="00:43:33.360" style="s2">history and I think a lot of people do</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.950" end="00:43:35.100" style="s2">have the awareness that even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.360" end="00:43:40.170" style="s2">something wasn&#39;t intended as a grand</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.100" end="00:43:43.460" style="s2">plot that opportunism is a thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.170" end="00:43:47.750" style="s2">don&#39;t think that most people think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.460" end="00:43:51.300" style="s2">Facebook and Google want everyone&#39;s data</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.300" end="00:43:55.380" style="s2">good like they they commercialize the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.880" end="00:43:57.510" style="s2">fuck out of that data in ways that do</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.380" end="00:43:59.460" style="s2">not necessarily improve the lives of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.510" end="00:44:00.630" style="s2">people and sometimes like like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.460" end="00:44:07.260" style="s2">actually turning the people into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.630" end="00:44:10.440" style="s2">commodity the other thing is that when</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.260" end="00:44:13.950" style="s2">you see developing nations respond</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.440" end="00:44:16.580" style="s2">better than the US which has happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.950" end="00:44:17.700" style="s2">for a number of them and when you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.580" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.700" end="00:44:23.180" style="s2">when you see Vietnam responding better</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.100" end="00:44:23.180" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.730" end="00:44:31.530" style="s2">some Latin American countries and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:33.900" style="s2">whatever and you see how far ahead we</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.530" end="00:44:35.250" style="s2">knew this was a thing and you see the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.900" end="00:44:36.780" style="s2">intelligence briefings that were there</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.250" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">and the lack of response and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.780" end="00:44:42.599" style="s2">what the logistical capabilities of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:45.480" style="s2">of the US military and DOD that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.599" end="00:44:47.990" style="s2">even have to override anyone&#39;s freedom</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.480" end="00:44:50.339" style="s2">to just offer logistical support our and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:51.569" style="s2">you know how much damage is happening to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.339" end="00:44:52.799" style="s2">the economy and how much cheaper it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.569" end="00:44:54.990" style="s2">would have been to actually do upfront</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.799" end="00:44:57.210" style="s2">work and the fact that there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.990" end="00:44:58.740" style="s2">tests and that by the time we had got</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.210" end="00:45:00.359" style="s2">our first hundred thousand tests out</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.740" end="00:45:01.859" style="s2">Germany had been doing five hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.359" end="00:45:04.950" style="s2">thousand a week for a long time with a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.859" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">tiny percentage of population there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.950" end="00:45:10.859" style="s2">much of that that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:13.710" style="s2">like is that just incompetence like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.859" end="00:45:16.890" style="s2">almost mind-blowing to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.710" end="00:45:18.569" style="s2">that&#39;s just incompetence given that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.890" end="00:45:21.540" style="s2">have so much actual fucking competence</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.569" end="00:45:23.309" style="s2">like the if there&#39;s anything the US</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.540" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2">military is really good at like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.309" end="00:45:31.049" style="s2">really good at logistics and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:32.970" style="s2">have to be deployed in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.049" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">overrides any civil liberties to simply</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.970" end="00:45:36.690" style="s2">be deployed to support stuff to support</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:38.010" style="s2">supply chains and get PPE where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.690" end="00:45:42.030" style="s2">supposed to go and shit why wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.010" end="00:45:45.750" style="s2">why didn&#39;t happen why didn&#39;t we get you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.030" end="00:45:47.849" style="s2">know and when you look at Germany and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.750" end="00:45:49.290" style="s2">its testing or you look at Hong Kong and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.849" end="00:45:50.670" style="s2">the way it shut the borders down you</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.290" end="00:45:52.109" style="s2">look at the way South Korea rolled it</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.670" end="00:45:55.910" style="s2">out as a democracy or you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.109" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">way Iceland did you look at this and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.910" end="00:46:03.059" style="s2">and then when you also look at well why</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:04.859" style="s2">the fuck did Beijing not let anyone fly</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.059" end="00:46:06.420" style="s2">from Wuhan to the rest of China but they</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.859" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">did let them fly from wander the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.420" end="00:46:10.589" style="s2">the world and a number of other very</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:19.020" style="s2">strange things about the flows of PPE</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.589" end="00:46:24.059" style="s2">and stuff like that I think that people</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">will jump to the wrong theory but</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.059" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">sometimes because of a right intuition</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:32.490" style="s2">and the right intuition is there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:35.180" style="s2">some agents benefiting from this and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.490" end="00:46:35.180" style="s2">don&#39;t feel good about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.190" end="00:46:39.060" style="s2">and then a rather than being able to sit</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.270" style="s2">with the uncertainty long enough to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.060" end="00:46:44.040" style="s2">the right kind of research so like did</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.270" end="00:46:46.380" style="s2">Trump get this wrong for a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.040" end="00:46:49.940" style="s2">terms of saying oh there&#39;s no big deal</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.380" end="00:46:52.140" style="s2">we got it handled whatever yes totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.940" end="00:46:54.119" style="s2">does that mean he&#39;s driving the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.140" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">thing for some agenda for himself super</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.119" end="00:46:59.339" style="s2">effectively and it&#39;s really because he</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:01.290" style="s2">owns shares in the hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.339" end="00:47:03.089" style="s2">company and that&#39;s why he said it well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.290" end="00:47:06.990" style="s2">would say that that&#39;s not very good</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.089" end="00:47:10.109" style="s2">conspiracy investigation the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.990" end="00:47:11.430" style="s2">he owns some shares in a financial</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.109" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">services company I think it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.430" end="00:47:14.940" style="s2">mutual fund or something we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:16.530" style="s2">some shares in a company that produces</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:18.030" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine which is a generic</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.530" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">which means that it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.030" end="00:47:21.270" style="s2">patent on and lots of companies can</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:24.420" style="s2">produce it and there&#39;s not much money to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.270" end="00:47:26.099" style="s2">be made on it yeah like you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.420" end="00:47:29.490" style="s2">really good conspiracies for like a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.099" end="00:47:30.780" style="s2">bucks you you could have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.490" end="00:47:33.060" style="s2">do something better than that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.780" end="00:47:35.010" style="s2">just like a follow the money trail but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.060" end="00:47:35.940" style="s2">not not that money trail right that just</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.010" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like a particular good</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.940" end="00:47:40.589" style="s2">money trail so actually the main thing I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">want with conspiracy theorist is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.589" end="00:47:44.310" style="s2">they get better at it did they get</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:47.730" style="s2">better at actually studying history and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.310" end="00:47:49.970" style="s2">settings physiology and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.730" end="00:47:54.470" style="s2">actually check facts and follow</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.970" end="00:47:57.540" style="s2">accounting records and you know go read</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.470" end="00:47:59.780" style="s2">the doctrine of unrestricted warfare to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.540" end="00:48:05.849" style="s2">have some sense of what PLA and CCP</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.780" end="00:48:07.380" style="s2">likely think the whole idea don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.849" end="00:48:09.510" style="s2">explain my malice what can be explained</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.380" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">by incompetence that&#39;s also an important</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.510" end="00:48:16.260" style="s2">rule like slow-moving stupid internally</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:18.329" style="s2">friction filled bureaucracies like</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.260" end="00:48:19.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a real thing and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.329" end="00:48:21.990" style="s2">have a lot of systems that are super</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.740" end="00:48:23.940" style="s2">ossified and are not good at sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.990" end="00:48:25.800" style="s2">making and not agile in their response</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.940" end="00:48:29.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s a real thing so you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.800" end="00:48:29.750" style="s2">certainly ascribe a lot of stuff to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.109" end="00:48:34.560" style="s2">where there are groups it seemed to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.430" end="00:48:36.210" style="s2">good Intel and the agenda capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.560" end="00:48:38.819" style="s2">act and took the wrong actions it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.210" end="00:48:40.380" style="s2">interested you still don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.819" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">know what the motive was and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.380" end="00:48:44.339" style="s2">of the interesting things about like</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:46.380" style="s2">motive is something that is outside of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.339" end="00:48:48.420" style="s2">the domain of the formal methods of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.380" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">science which is why social science</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.420" end="00:48:50.369" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:52.290" style="s2">soft science because I can&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.369" end="00:48:55.190" style="s2">your motive I can&#39;t do a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.290" end="00:48:57.900" style="s2">measure and repetition on that measure</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.190" end="00:48:59.970" style="s2">well but can&#39;t I measure your brain well</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.900" end="00:49:04.140" style="s2">we don&#39;t really have perfect one-for-one</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.970" end="00:49:07.320" style="s2">neural correlates right so I can observe</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.140" end="00:49:10.650" style="s2">your action and then I have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.320" end="00:49:15.000" style="s2">infer motive and belief and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.650" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">inference is a big step now maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.000" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">wrote an email I can find your email and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">you express it or whatever so this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:26.220" style="s2">where people have to be careful if they</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:29.070" style="s2">actually want to try to do sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.220" end="00:49:30.900" style="s2">well to just look at where did I make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.070" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">logical leap and what was my basis to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.900" end="00:49:35.580" style="s2">make that leap and how much how much of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:37.109" style="s2">a what are the different answers that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.580" end="00:49:39.540" style="s2">could be here and let&#39;s run all of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.109" end="00:49:43.380" style="s2">and then how do I say for this</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.540" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">particular premise how how would I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.380" end="00:49:46.920" style="s2">falsify this or verify this or if this</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.840" style="s2">was true what other things would be true</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.920" end="00:49:50.010" style="s2">that I can look for if this was false</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.010" end="00:49:57.869" style="s2">can look for there the certainty of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.099" end="00:50:00.599" style="s2">is just a virus everybody&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.869" end="00:50:02.070" style="s2">best they can the political party I</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.599" end="00:50:05.820" style="s2">don&#39;t like is kind of at fault for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.070" end="00:50:07.349" style="s2">bad response and fuck those guys but we</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.820" end="00:50:08.790" style="s2">just need to band together and kind of</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.770" end="00:50:42.200" style="s2">definitely see people that have a</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.200" end="00:50:48.950" style="s2">that corresponds with their general bias</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.690" end="00:50:55.250" style="s2">oversimplification is a starting place</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.369" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.250" end="00:50:59.910" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna even postulate where this</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.910" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">but again not all the time this this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.670" end="00:51:06.690" style="s2">a pattern that we can observe enough of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.390" style="s2">the time that it&#39;s interesting to look</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.690" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">at the reason I&#39;m careful with saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.390" end="00:51:12.510" style="s2">things like that is because when someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:13.560" style="s2">over norms their patterns that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.510" end="00:51:23.030" style="s2">the places that their sense making</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.560" end="00:51:27.140" style="s2">becomes bad I have seen relatively often</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.030" end="00:51:30.090" style="s2">people who generally think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.140" end="00:51:32.280" style="s2">government bodies are kind of lame and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.090" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">ossified whatever but mostly regulate in</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:38.910" style="s2">trust authorities the universities</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">mostly say true stuff whatever things</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.910" end="00:51:43.140" style="s2">those people the generous authorities</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">also generally have a frame that things</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.140" end="00:51:48.420" style="s2">are mostly getting better in the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:50.600" style="s2">right now a lot less people have that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.420" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">frame but in general that frame and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.600" end="00:51:59.000" style="s2">generally not always those people did</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:52:02.250" style="s2">better in childhood like at school in</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.000" end="00:52:03.630" style="s2">sports they&#39;re oftentimes their parents</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.250" end="00:52:05.609" style="s2">were either more success or they did</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.630" end="00:52:06.900" style="s2">better relative to them so they had this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.609" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">experience that the system actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.900" end="00:52:11.400" style="s2">works for me and that the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:16.500" style="s2">are are actually trustworthy and I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.400" end="00:52:18.540" style="s2">a good relationship with him and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.500" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">creates a kind of intuitive felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.540" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">so it&#39;s so kind of like the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.730" style="s2">grounding felt sense where then even if</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:25.109" style="s2">they&#39;re in another environment where</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.730" end="00:52:26.340" style="s2">that&#39;s not true and it was true in the</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.340" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">childhood that&#39;s still the felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.230" end="00:52:33.750" style="s2">and then they sometimes will keep that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:36.600" style="s2">forever or they have to be disabused of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.750" end="00:52:39.240" style="s2">it somewhat painfully at some point now</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.600" end="00:52:40.500" style="s2">other people who have the general sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.240" end="00:52:46.010" style="s2">that most authorities are probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.500" end="00:52:48.869" style="s2">corrupt and probably abusing power and</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.270" end="00:53:10.700" style="s2">and often times had authorities</p>

<p begin="00:54:32.660" end="00:54:46.250" style="s2">hold a strong view on the topic so hey</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.850" end="00:54:47.840" style="s2">the only way to get through this is herd</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.250" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">immunity that&#39;s the way that respiratory</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.410" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">outside it&#39;ll be fine there won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.390" end="00:54:56.420" style="s2">that many deaths because it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.559" end="00:55:39.609" style="s2">there good evidence that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.329" end="00:55:43.000" style="s2">showing cleared are getting reinfected</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.609" end="00:55:47.369" style="s2">is that reinfected or is it a resurgence</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.000" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">or was it a false test does it seem like</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.369" end="00:55:53.260" style="s2">in the studies coming out of China that</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">older people are producing 3 to 5x the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.260" end="00:55:56.710" style="s2">antibodies of younger people which seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:58.029" style="s2">to be the opposite of what we&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.710" end="00:56:00.309" style="s2">which makes us question what those</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.029" end="00:56:02.950" style="s2">antibodies will do will they will they</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.309" end="00:56:04.869" style="s2">protect against getting it again where</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.950" end="00:56:06.730" style="s2">you won&#39;t get it at all will they</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.730" end="00:56:10.359" style="s2">less severe or might they actually prime</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.529" end="00:56:14.349" style="s2">a more severe response that happens with</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.359" end="00:56:15.940" style="s2">some things like thank-you fever given</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.349" end="00:56:17.309" style="s2">that people who die are actually dying</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.940" end="00:56:20.410" style="s2">of excessive immune response right</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.309" end="00:56:24.279" style="s2">cytokine storm responses or that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.410" end="00:56:25.390" style="s2">of evidence of that if the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.279" end="00:56:32.829" style="s2">are conferred how long will they last</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.390" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">and given the decay rate on them and how</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.829" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">much can we infer from other</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:41.609" style="s2">coronaviruses about this which is a</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:51.010" style="s2">anywhere near as fast as influenza and</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.010" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">dynamics it&#39;s probably if we come up</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.589" style="s2">it&#39;ll be against it&#39;ll be good and then</p>
