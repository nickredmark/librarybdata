<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:50.050" style="s2">fed into this and then I made the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">argument that it is probably at some</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.619" end="00:01:13.810" style="s2">to do is two things we need to try and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.259" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">give a naturalistic account of this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.810" end="00:01:19.659" style="s2">then show if we have naturalized this</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:23.049" style="s2">can we then use it in an elegant manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.659" end="00:01:28.570" style="s2">to explain a lot of the central features</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.049" end="00:01:31.000" style="s2">of human spirituality and I already</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.430" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">has to do with the very nature of</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.400" end="00:03:18.010" style="s2">realization now we&#39;ve gone a long way</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.750" end="00:03:21.239" style="s2">towards doing that because we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.010" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">got this worked out in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:33.790" style="s2">could we see them potentially realized</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.790" end="00:03:44.169" style="s2">to advertise for the brain I understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.730" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">why people want to resist the urge of</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.590" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a very bad way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.329" end="00:03:52.359" style="s2">that&#39;s like saying it a table there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.379" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">the atoms the way those that structural</p>

<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:06.370" style="s2">simplistic reductionism should</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.109" style="s2">definitely be questioned on the other</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.180" end="00:04:30.460" style="s2">you can one aspect of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">realization the aspect that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.460" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">with trading between being able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">generalize and specialize as I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:40.630" style="s2">is a system going through compression</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">remember that&#39;s something like what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.630" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">with line of the best fit and particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:50.290" style="s2">ization when your function is more</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">tightly fitted to the contextually</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:55.540" style="s2">specific data set and again this gives</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">you efficiency this gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.540" end="00:04:59.080" style="s2">resiliency this tends to integrate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">assimilate this tends to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.080" end="00:05:02.680" style="s2">never accommodate okay so try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">that on mine now what I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.680" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2">do is argue that there is suggestive</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:11.830" style="s2">it&#39;s by no means definitive and I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.420" end="00:05:15.130" style="s2">it clearly understood that I am not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:17.650" style="s2">proposing to prove anything here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:20.500" style="s2">not my endeavor my endeavor is to show</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.650" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">that there is suggestive evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.500" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">something and all I need is that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:30.910" style="s2">makes it plausible that there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:36.430" style="s2">way to empirically explain relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.910" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">realization so let&#39;s talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.430" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">this looks like</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s increasing evidence that when</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:46.690" style="s2">neurons fire in synchrony together</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:50.130" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something like compression</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.690" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">so if you give for example somebody a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.130" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">picture that they can&#39;t quite make out</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:58.780" style="s2">in your looking how the brain is firing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:06:00.070" style="s2">the areas of the visual cortex for</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.780" end="00:06:01.960" style="s2">example if it&#39;s a visual picture are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.070" end="00:06:04.630" style="s2">firing sort of asynchronously and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.960" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">when the person gets in though AHA you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.630" end="00:06:07.990" style="s2">get large areas that fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.090" style="s2">synchrony together interestingly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.990" end="00:06:13.030" style="s2">even increasing evidence that when human</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.090" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2">beings are cooperating in joint</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.030" end="00:06:16.510" style="s2">attention and joint activity their</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">brains are getting in to patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.510" end="00:06:20.950" style="s2">synchrony so that opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:23.770" style="s2">possibility for a very serious account</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.950" end="00:06:28.900" style="s2">of distributed cognition I&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.770" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">to that much later now what we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.900" end="00:06:33.340" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the cortex right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:35.310" style="s2">this is the point that&#39;s very I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.340" end="00:06:37.810" style="s2">very important this is scale invariant</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.310" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">which what that means is that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.810" end="00:06:42.280" style="s2">levels of analysis you will see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:44.320" style="s2">process happening why is that important</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.280" end="00:06:45.760" style="s2">well if you remember relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.320" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">realization has to be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.760" end="00:06:50.260" style="s2">happening very locally very globally it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">has to be happening pervasively</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.260" end="00:06:53.410" style="s2">throughout all of your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.150" end="00:06:56.650" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.410" end="00:06:58.360" style="s2">so the fact that this this process I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.650" end="00:07:00.520" style="s2">describing is also Skellington variant</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.360" end="00:07:04.020" style="s2">in the brain is suggestive that it can</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:09.670" style="s2">be implementing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.020" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">okay now what happens is at many levels</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.670" end="00:07:15.730" style="s2">of analysis what you have is right you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">have this pattern where neurons are</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.730" end="00:07:19.570" style="s2">firing in synchrony and then they become</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.010" style="s2">asynchronous and then they fire in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.570" end="00:07:22.570" style="s2">synchrony and then they become</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.410" end="00:07:59.790" style="s2">relevance realization okay so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.900" end="00:08:01.070" style="s2">a little bit about this first and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.790" end="00:08:04.890" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to its particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.070" end="00:08:07.370" style="s2">implement instantiation in the brain so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.890" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">self-organizing criticality this goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.370" end="00:08:14.940" style="s2">originally back to the work of per Bock</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">and so let&#39;s say you have grains of sand</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.940" end="00:08:22.740" style="s2">falling like in an hourglass and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">initially it&#39;s random well random and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.740" end="00:08:28.440" style="s2">from our point of view of we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">within a zone a individual grains will</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.440" end="00:08:31.140" style="s2">end up somewhere in that zone we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:33.539" style="s2">know where cuz they&#39;ll bounce and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.140" end="00:08:35.820" style="s2">but over time what happens because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.539" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">there&#39;s a virtual engine there friction</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.820" end="00:08:41.190" style="s2">and gravity but also the bounce right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.729" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">the bouncing introduces variation the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.190" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">friction and you know the gravity put</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:49.110" style="s2">constraint and what happens is the sand</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:52.470" style="s2">grains self-organized there&#39;s no little</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.110" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">elf that runs in and shapes the sand</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.470" end="00:08:59.940" style="s2">into a mold itself organizes into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:03.350" style="s2">mound like that and it keeps doing this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.940" end="00:09:07.550" style="s2">and keeps doing this now at some point</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:11.940" style="s2">right it enters a critical phase</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.550" end="00:09:15.060" style="s2">criticality means the system is close to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.940" end="00:09:17.970" style="s2">right is potentially breaking down see</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.970" end="00:09:24.960" style="s2">it demonstrates a high degree of order</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.630" end="00:09:28.650" style="s2">order means that as this mound takes</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.650" end="00:09:33.150" style="s2">sand gives me a lot of information about</p>

<p begin="00:09:33.150" end="00:09:36.300" style="s2">because they&#39;re so tightly organized</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:39.510" style="s2">it&#39;s highly ordered but then what</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.300" end="00:09:41.640" style="s2">happens is that order breaks down right</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.510" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">and you get an avalanche it avalanches</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.640" end="00:09:45.510" style="s2">down and it&#39;s just and if and if this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:48.210" style="s2">too great if the criticality becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.510" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">great this system will collapse and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.210" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">there are people that argue that</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.529" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">the following the sand spreads out due</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.559" end="00:10:18.930" style="s2">to the Avalanche and then that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:20.309" style="s2">introduces variation important changes</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.379" style="s2">now what happens is right there is a</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.379" end="00:10:34.050" style="s2">new mound forms and it can go much</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.129" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">higher than the previous mound it has an</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:41.939" style="s2">the previous system and then it cycles</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.230" end="00:11:38.429" style="s2">doing data compression and then it does</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.249" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">highly plausible that self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.619" end="00:15:07.299" style="s2">criticality is functional in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:09.639" style="s2">in a fundamental way and that lines up</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.299" end="00:15:13.209" style="s2">it&#39;s convergent with this so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.639" end="00:15:18.040" style="s2">got is the possibility I mean I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.209" end="00:15:21.100" style="s2">this this carries with it from so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:22.809" style="s2">hesitant here because I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.100" end="00:15:24.429" style="s2">want to buy by drawing out the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.809" end="00:15:26.379" style="s2">implications I don&#39;t want to thereby say</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.429" end="00:15:28.809" style="s2">that this has been proven I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.379" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">that but so remember the if but if this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.809" end="00:15:34.089" style="s2">is right this has important implications</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:36.699" style="s2">it says that we may be able to move from</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.089" end="00:15:39.489" style="s2">psychometric measures of intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.699" end="00:15:41.669" style="s2">direct measures in the brain much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.489" end="00:15:44.529" style="s2">in that sense objective measures</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.669" end="00:15:47.439" style="s2">secondly if this is on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.529" end="00:15:50.220" style="s2">it will feed member this a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.439" end="00:15:53.110" style="s2">ideas were derived from sort of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.220" end="00:15:55.169" style="s2">features of artificial intelligence if</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.110" end="00:15:59.169" style="s2">this is right it may help in feedback</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.169" end="00:16:02.379" style="s2">into this and help develop artificial</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.169" end="00:16:05.980" style="s2">intelligence so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.379" end="00:16:10.239" style="s2">potential here unfortunately for both</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:12.129" style="s2">good or ill I&#39;m hoping if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.239" end="00:16:15.399" style="s2">me a brief aside I&#39;m hoping by this</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.399" end="00:16:19.179" style="s2">much as I can and the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.439" end="00:16:21.209" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work with can and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.179" end="00:16:24.669" style="s2">lab and my colleagues linked this</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.209" end="00:16:27.970" style="s2">emergent scientific understanding very</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.669" end="00:16:29.589" style="s2">tightly to the spiritual project of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.970" end="00:16:32.829" style="s2">addressing the meaning crisis rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.589" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">than letting it just run rampant</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.829" end="00:16:38.980" style="s2">willy-nilly all right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:42.370" style="s2">me that&#39;s a way in which we could give a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.980" end="00:16:45.160" style="s2">naturalistic account of our our in terms</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.370" end="00:16:50.110" style="s2">of how neurons are firing there these</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.160" end="00:16:52.360" style="s2">are firing patterns now I need another</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.110" end="00:16:55.779" style="s2">scale-invariant thing but I need it to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.360" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">deal with not how neurons are firing but</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.779" end="00:17:03.699" style="s2">how their wiring what kinds of networks</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:06.339" style="s2">they&#39;re forming I&#39;m not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.699" end="00:17:07.959" style="s2">happy with the wiring metaphor but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.339" end="00:17:10.419" style="s2">has become pervasive in our culture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.959" end="00:17:17.110" style="s2">it&#39;s mnemonic ly useful because firing</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.419" end="00:17:20.250" style="s2">and wiring rhyme together so again there</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.110" end="00:17:22.659" style="s2">is a sort of a new way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.250" end="00:17:25.659" style="s2">how we can look at Network it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.659" end="00:17:27.429" style="s2">graph theory or network theory it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.659" end="00:17:29.950" style="s2">gotten very complex in a very short</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.429" end="00:17:31.990" style="s2">amount of time so I want to do just sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.950" end="00:17:38.710" style="s2">of the core basic idea with you that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.990" end="00:17:41.169" style="s2">there&#39;s three kinds of networks right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.710" end="00:17:43.030" style="s2">this is a neutral all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.169" end="00:17:46.179" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t mean just networks in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.030" end="00:17:49.179" style="s2">brain it can mean networks like how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.179" end="00:17:52.659" style="s2">Internet is a network it could mean how</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.179" end="00:17:55.179" style="s2">an airline is a network a rail railway</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.659" end="00:17:56.950" style="s2">system etc this analysis this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.179" end="00:17:58.870" style="s2">theoretical machinery is applicable to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.950" end="00:18:00.669" style="s2">all kinds of networks which is part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.870" end="00:18:02.110" style="s2">its power so you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.669" end="00:18:03.880" style="s2">nodes these are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.110" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">connected and then you have connections</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.880" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2">so these I&#39;m drawing two connections</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:12.100" style="s2">here this isn&#39;t a single thick one these</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">are two individual ones okay two</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.100" end="00:18:20.580" style="s2">individual connections here so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:24.150" style="s2">sort of the same number right of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.580" end="00:18:26.980" style="s2">connections and nodes for each network</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.150" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">so there&#39;s are three kinds of network so</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.980" end="00:18:31.390" style="s2">this is called a regular network it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:34.809" style="s2">regular because all of the connections</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.390" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">are short distance connections okay and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.809" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:41.830" style="s2">redundancy in this network everything is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:45.460" style="s2">double connected okay this is called a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.830" end="00:18:48.430" style="s2">random or a chaotic Network right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.460" end="00:18:51.820" style="s2">mixture of short and long</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.430" end="00:18:54.220" style="s2">connections and then this is called a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.820" end="00:18:56.050" style="s2">small world network this comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.220" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">Disney song it&#39;s a small world after all</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.050" end="00:19:01.450" style="s2">because this was originally sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.950" style="s2">discovered by Milgram when he was</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:04.930" style="s2">studying patterns of social</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.950" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">connectedness and it&#39;s a small world</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.930" end="00:19:12.550" style="s2">after all all right now again these now</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:13.750" style="s2">originally people were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.550" end="00:19:15.580" style="s2">about these it&#39;s now understood that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.750" end="00:19:18.130" style="s2">these are just these are names for broad</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.580" end="00:19:19.960" style="s2">families of different kinds of networks</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.130" end="00:19:21.670" style="s2">that can be analyzed in too many</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.960" end="00:19:24.610" style="s2">different subspecies and I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.670" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">into that detail because I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.610" end="00:19:32.560" style="s2">to make an overarching core argument so</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">remember I said that this network has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.560" end="00:19:37.480" style="s2">lot of redundancy in it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:41.850" style="s2">really important because that means that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.480" end="00:19:44.500" style="s2">this network is terrifically resilient I</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.850" end="00:19:47.230" style="s2">can do a lot of damage to this network</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.500" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">and no node gets isolated nothing falls</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.230" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">out of communication it has tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:54.940" style="s2">it&#39;s tremendously resilient very</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:56.620" style="s2">resilient but you pay a price for that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.940" end="00:19:58.750" style="s2">all that redundancy this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.620" end="00:20:00.100" style="s2">very inefficient network now your brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.750" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">might tricky because that looks so well</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.100" end="00:20:04.420" style="s2">ordered it looks like a nice clean room</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:06.550" style="s2">right and clean rooms look like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.420" end="00:20:07.810" style="s2">really highly ordered and that&#39;s oh this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.550" end="00:20:09.700" style="s2">is must be the most efficient because</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.810" end="00:20:11.470" style="s2">cleanliness is orderliness and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.700" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">orderliness is efficiency and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.470" end="00:20:16.300" style="s2">let that mislead you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:17.830" style="s2">measure how efficient the network is by</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.300" end="00:20:20.170" style="s2">calculating what&#39;s called its mean path</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.830" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">distance I calculate the number of steps</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.170" end="00:20:24.070" style="s2">between Eenie between all the pairs so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:25.480" style="s2">how many how many steps do I have to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.070" end="00:20:27.070" style="s2">through to get from here to here one two</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.480" end="00:20:29.260" style="s2">how many do I have to go to go from here</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.070" end="00:20:30.790" style="s2">to here one two three four I do that for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.260" end="00:20:33.460" style="s2">all the pairs and then I get an average</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.790" end="00:20:35.380" style="s2">of it and the mean path distance</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.460" end="00:20:38.970" style="s2">measures how efficient your network is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.380" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">at basically communicating information</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.970" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">these have a very very high mean path</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:49.750" style="s2">distance so they&#39;re very inefficient you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">pay a price for all that redundancy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.750" end="00:20:52.750" style="s2">that&#39;s of course because we&#39;re done to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.980" end="00:20:56.560" style="s2">see inefficiency or in a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.750" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">relationship now this and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.560" end="00:21:01.510" style="s2">your Dania Bryn&#39;s gonna look this is so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.390" end="00:21:01.870" style="s2">messy right this is so messy well it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.510" end="00:21:05.950" style="s2">turns</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.870" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">this is actually efficient all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.950" end="00:21:09.820" style="s2">it&#39;s right it&#39;s actually very efficient</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">because it has so many long-distance</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.820" end="00:21:14.920" style="s2">connections it&#39;s very very efficient it</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">has a very low mean path distance but</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.920" end="00:21:20.190" style="s2">because they&#39;re in a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:20.190" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s it&#39;s not resilient</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.300" end="00:21:33.370" style="s2">very poor and resiliency right so notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:36.780" style="s2">what we&#39;re getting here these networks</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.370" end="00:21:40.150" style="s2">are being constrained in their</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.780" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">functionality by the trade-off in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.150" end="00:21:48.220" style="s2">bio economics of efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:50.230" style="s2">resiliency Marcus breed as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.220" end="00:21:55.630" style="s2">mathematical proofs about this in his</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.230" end="00:21:57.190" style="s2">work on network configuration now what</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.630" end="00:22:01.420" style="s2">about this one the small world network</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.190" end="00:22:04.150" style="s2">well it&#39;s more efficient than the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.420" end="00:22:06.160" style="s2">regular network but less efficient than</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.150" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">the random network but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.160" end="00:22:13.210" style="s2">resilient than the random network but</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:16.270" style="s2">less resilient than the regular Network</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.549" end="00:31:09.129" style="s2">this has to do with the work of cut</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.129" end="00:31:15.489" style="s2">work was in 2004 so they did what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:17.980" style="s2">called a binocular rivalry experiment</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.489" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">basically you present two images to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.980" end="00:31:23.499" style="s2">somebody and they&#39;re positioned in such</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:24.909" style="s2">a way that they right they are going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.499" end="00:31:26.739" style="s2">the different visual fields and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.909" end="00:31:28.869" style="s2">compete with each other because of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.739" end="00:31:30.759" style="s2">design and then so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.869" end="00:31:33.489" style="s2">people&#39;s visual experience is they let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.759" end="00:31:35.230" style="s2">say it&#39;s a triangle and a cross that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.489" end="00:31:36.970" style="s2">what they&#39;ll have experientially is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.230" end="00:31:38.289" style="s2">seeing across oh now I&#39;m seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.970" end="00:31:39.909" style="s2">triangle I&#39;m seeing the cross and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.289" end="00:31:43.690" style="s2">seeing a triangle and and don&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.909" end="00:31:50.259" style="s2">that but that&#39;s not obscure to you right</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.690" end="00:31:53.580" style="s2">so you know the Necker cube right when</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.259" end="00:31:56.440" style="s2">you watch the nectar cube it flips right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.580" end="00:32:01.059" style="s2">so this can be the front and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.440" end="00:32:05.369" style="s2">back this way right or you can flip and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.059" end="00:32:08.679" style="s2">you can see it the other way and so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.369" end="00:32:12.789" style="s2">are even doing bar napkin or this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.679" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">front and it goes that way right so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.789" end="00:32:16.600" style="s2">are constantly flipping between these</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:17.799" style="s2">and you can&#39;t see them both at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.600" end="00:32:19.899" style="s2">time so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.799" end="00:32:21.309" style="s2">that&#39;s what binocular rivalry is and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.899" end="00:32:22.809" style="s2">what you have though is you do this a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.309" end="00:32:24.340" style="s2">little bit more controlled you present</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.809" end="00:32:26.019" style="s2">it to two different visual fields so</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.340" end="00:32:27.639" style="s2">different areas of the brain and so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.019" end="00:32:31.119" style="s2">you can see is what happens when the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.639" end="00:32:33.669" style="s2">person is seeing the triangle well one</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.119" end="00:32:37.330" style="s2">part of the brain goes into synchrony</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.669" end="00:32:38.950" style="s2">and then as soon as the triangle that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.330" end="00:32:40.690" style="s2">goes asynchronous and the other part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.950" end="00:32:42.909" style="s2">the brain that&#39;s picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.690" end="00:32:44.619" style="s2">plusses right because that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.909" end="00:32:46.779" style="s2">area the brain gets more basic right</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.619" end="00:32:49.179" style="s2">that goes into synchrony and what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.779" end="00:32:51.220" style="s2">can see is as the person flips back and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.179" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">forth in experience different areas of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.220" end="00:32:56.619" style="s2">the brain are going into synchrony or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:58.359" style="s2">synchrony so that is suggestive of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.619" end="00:33:01.119" style="s2">relationship between consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.359" end="00:33:04.269" style="s2">self-organizing criticality again</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.119" end="00:33:06.249" style="s2">suggestive but we&#39;ve already got</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.269" end="00:33:07.809" style="s2">independent evidence meaning a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.249" end="00:33:09.730" style="s2">convergent evidence that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.809" end="00:33:12.130" style="s2">functionality of consciousness is to do</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.130" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s strong correlation via working</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:23.580" style="s2">intelligence and so and we knew we know</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">that this is plausibly associated with</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.580" end="00:33:28.870" style="s2">self-organizing criticality so again</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:34.660" style="s2">convincing no suggestively convergent</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.870" end="00:33:50.140" style="s2">yes there&#39;s another set of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.660" end="00:33:51.160" style="s2">done by Monte Adel in 2013 and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.140" end="00:33:54.760" style="s2">you&#39;re basically doing is you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.160" end="00:33:56.800" style="s2">people a general anaesthetic and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.760" end="00:33:58.930" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re observing their brain as</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.800" end="00:34:01.390" style="s2">they pass out of consciousness and back</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.930" end="00:34:04.990" style="s2">into consciousness and what did they</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.390" end="00:34:09.250" style="s2">find they found that as the brain passes</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.990" end="00:34:11.409" style="s2">out of consciousness it loses its</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:13.240" style="s2">overall structure as a small world</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.409" end="00:34:15.720" style="s2">network and breaks down into more local</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.240" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">networks and then as it returns into</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.720" end="00:34:21.610" style="s2">consciousness it goes into a small</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">network small world of network formation</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.610" end="00:34:29.290" style="s2">again so that consciousness seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:33.429" style="s2">strongly associated with the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.290" end="00:34:36.730" style="s2">which the brain is wiring as a small</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.429" end="00:34:38.530" style="s2">world network now I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.730" end="00:34:40.360" style="s2">bring these together in a more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.530" end="00:34:46.179" style="s2">instance where you can see the</p>

<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:55.960" style="s2">that work I want to bring it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.250" end="00:35:00.970" style="s2">machinery of insight the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.960" end="00:35:02.890" style="s2">insight so if you remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.970" end="00:35:04.810" style="s2">about this because we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.890" end="00:35:06.460" style="s2">use of disruptive strategies and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.810" end="00:35:08.850" style="s2">talked about the work of Stefan and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.460" end="00:35:08.850" style="s2">Dixon</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.840" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">do you remember that what they found was</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.340" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">they kind of way a very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.850" style="s2">way but nevertheless a very reliable way</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.630" end="00:35:32.290" style="s2">of measuring how much entropy is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.850" end="00:35:33.850" style="s2">people&#39;s processing when they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.290" end="00:35:35.530" style="s2">to solve the inside problem remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.850" end="00:35:37.600" style="s2">they were tracing through the gear</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.530" end="00:35:40.450" style="s2">figures and what they found is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.600" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">entropy goes up right before the insight</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.450" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">and then it drops in the brain becomes</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:45.880" style="s2">even right that sorry the behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:51.610" style="s2">was a mistake on my part the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.880" end="00:35:54.790" style="s2">becomes even more organized right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.610" end="00:35:56.290" style="s2">that&#39;s plausibly and they suggested</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.790" end="00:35:58.360" style="s2">that&#39;s plausibly an instance of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.290" end="00:36:01.090" style="s2">self-organizing criticality that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.360" end="00:36:03.340" style="s2">happening is you&#39;re getting right the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.090" end="00:36:06.610" style="s2">neural Avalanche it&#39;s breaking up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.340" end="00:36:08.380" style="s2">then that allows a restructuring which</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.610" end="00:36:10.810" style="s2">goes with the restructuring of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.380" end="00:36:13.690" style="s2">problem remember so you&#39;re breaking</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.810" end="00:36:15.730" style="s2">frame with the neural Avalanche and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.690" end="00:36:19.590" style="s2">you&#39;re making frame like the new round</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.730" end="00:36:22.690" style="s2">right as you restructure right your</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.590" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">problem framing and you get the insight</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.690" end="00:36:32.820" style="s2">and you get a solution to your problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">now interestingly enough Schilling has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.820" end="00:36:38.500" style="s2">Malthus is linking insight to Salk very</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">clearly Shelley has a mathematical model</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.500" end="00:36:47.860" style="s2">from 2005 linking insight to small world</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:49.690" style="s2">networks she argues quite persuasively</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.860" end="00:36:51.970" style="s2">that&#39;s what this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.690" end="00:36:54.940" style="s2">since what you can see happening in an</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.970" end="00:36:58.780" style="s2">insight is that people&#39;s information is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.940" end="00:37:00.010" style="s2">initially organized like in a regular</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.780" end="00:37:03.100" style="s2">Network just think about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.010" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">intuitively like so my information is</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.100" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">sort of integrated here right local</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:11.080" style="s2">organization a regular network local</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.630" style="s2">organization right so the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.080" end="00:37:17.620" style="s2">right right all I&#39;ve got is a regular</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:21.910" style="s2">Network but what can happen right is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.620" end="00:37:25.180" style="s2">here&#39;s my right my regular network I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.910" end="00:37:28.570" style="s2">make that a little more clear here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.180" end="00:37:31.530" style="s2">regular network right and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.570" end="00:37:31.530" style="s2">is right</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.950" end="00:37:39.859" style="s2">one of these I get a long-distance</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.869" end="00:37:43.609" style="s2">connection that forms so my my regular</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.859" end="00:37:47.000" style="s2">network suddenly is altered into a small</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.609" end="00:37:50.060" style="s2">world network which means right I lose</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.000" end="00:37:51.770" style="s2">some resiliency right listen resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.060" end="00:37:54.349" style="s2">but I gained a massive spike in</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.770" end="00:37:58.550" style="s2">efficiency I suddenly get more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.349" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">so insight is when a small sort of when</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.550" end="00:38:08.510" style="s2">a regular network is being converted</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:11.380" style="s2">into a small world network because that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.510" end="00:38:13.790" style="s2">means this is a process of optimization</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.380" end="00:38:17.780" style="s2">right because remember this is more</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.790" end="00:38:19.790" style="s2">optimal than this and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.780" end="00:38:21.470" style="s2">in how people&#39;s information is organized</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.790" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">in an insight they take two domains</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.470" end="00:38:26.060" style="s2">here&#39;s right think about how metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">affords insight you take two domains Sam</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.060" end="00:38:29.780" style="s2">as a pig and you get suddenly this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:32.330" style="s2">connection between it and those two</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.780" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">regular networks are now coalesced into</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.330" end="00:38:40.820" style="s2">a small world network okay that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2">so in some of the work I&#39;ve done with</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.820" end="00:38:45.349" style="s2">other people I&#39;ve been suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.200" end="00:38:47.990" style="s2">because of this the following that what</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.349" end="00:38:49.820" style="s2">happens in insight Allah Steven and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.990" end="00:38:52.010" style="s2">Stefan in Dixon is you get herself you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.820" end="00:38:54.770" style="s2">get self-organizing criticality and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.010" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">self-organizing criticality right breaks</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.770" end="00:39:04.040" style="s2">up a regular network and converts it</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:06.410" style="s2">into a small world network so what</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.040" end="00:39:09.470" style="s2">you&#39;re getting is suddenly sudden a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:11.150" style="s2">sudden enhancement increase the</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.190" end="00:39:47.130" style="s2">trying to give you stuff that is makes</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.410" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what I need right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.850" end="00:39:59.720" style="s2">what I&#39;ve tried to show you is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:02.130" style="s2">progressive the project is of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.720" end="00:40:04.230" style="s2">naturalizing this and how so much is</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.080" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">it plausible that there&#39;s a deep</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.920" end="00:40:53.820" style="s2">okay so remember how relevance</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.690" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">realization is happening at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.820" end="00:41:02.700" style="s2">interacting levels so we can think about</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.700" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">getting features that are getting picked</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:12.090" style="s2">up remember the multiple object tracking</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:15.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no this is this this so basic</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.090" end="00:41:18.150" style="s2">salience assignment right and then this</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.630" end="00:41:20.820" style="s2">is Bob based on work originally from</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.150" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">Mason in 1976 his book on sentience as</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.820" end="00:41:24.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned that before and then some</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:26.190" style="s2">work that I did with Jeff Marshman and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.090" end="00:41:28.020" style="s2">Steve Pierce and then later work that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.190" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">did with Anderson Todd and Richard woo</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.020" end="00:41:35.030" style="s2">the feature ization is also feeding up</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:39.180" style="s2">into for grounding and feeding back</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.030" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">alright so a bunch of there this this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.180" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">all these features and then presumably</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:46.680" style="s2">I&#39;m for grounded and other stuff is back</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:49.860" style="s2">rounded right</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.680" end="00:41:52.540" style="s2">this then feeds up in configuration</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.860" end="00:41:54.630" style="s2">you&#39;re configuring me together and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.540" end="00:41:56.950" style="s2">figuring me out think of that language</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.630" end="00:41:58.990" style="s2">right so that I have a structural</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.870" end="00:42:08.170" style="s2">there&#39;s feedback down to here and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.870" end="00:42:09.970" style="s2">that of course feeds back to and up to</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.970" end="00:42:13.900" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked a lot about that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.590" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">that feeds back right so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.900" end="00:42:20.230" style="s2">right this happening and it&#39;s giving you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:22.900" style="s2">this very dynamic and textured salience</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.230" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">landscape and then you have to you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.900" end="00:42:31.300" style="s2">to think about how that&#39;s the the core</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.300" end="00:42:36.550" style="s2">right notice notice what I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:38.950" style="s2">to you here you&#39;ve got the relevance</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.229" end="00:43:48.999" style="s2">this is how people are trying to wrestle</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:20.619" style="s2">just just as one example among many okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.549" end="00:44:23.079" style="s2">so this is feeding up and what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.619" end="00:44:28.569" style="s2">basically giving you is affordance</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.079" end="00:44:33.239" style="s2">aviation certain affordances are be are</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.420" end="00:44:38.469" style="s2">that of course is going to be the basis</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.469" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">to interact okay and I think there might</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.109" end="00:44:49.329" style="s2">be a way in which that more directly</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:50.769" style="s2">interacts here maybe through kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.769" end="00:44:57.940" style="s2">go into that we&#39;ll come back later and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.289" end="00:45:01.890" style="s2">to how propositional knowing relates to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.940" end="00:45:06.460" style="s2">all of this okay I&#39;m putting it aside</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.890" end="00:45:09.069" style="s2">because this is where we do most of our</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.069" end="00:45:12.910" style="s2">with this I think at the core the</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.910" end="00:45:18.609" style="s2">perspective of knowing that&#39;s grounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.549" end="00:45:20.710" style="s2">in our participatory knowing and it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.710" end="00:45:25.869" style="s2">to a tional awareness that obviates</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.990" end="00:45:27.880" style="s2">affordances is what you need in order to</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.880" end="00:45:32.500" style="s2">your skills and and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.089" style="s2">consciousness is about doing this higher</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:12.130" style="s2">but this has to do with the way</p>
