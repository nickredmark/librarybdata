<p begin="00:00:04.840" end="00:00:10.120" style="s2">I hate both phrases toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.410" end="00:00:12.610" style="s2">and toxic femininity and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.120" end="00:00:14.710" style="s2">piece that I wrote for Colette I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.610" end="00:00:17.710" style="s2">was called on toxic femininity to to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.710" end="00:00:19.689" style="s2">make the point right up front you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.710" end="00:00:22.660" style="s2">before I got into it in the piece that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.689" end="00:00:24.279" style="s2">this that this was going to be that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.660" end="00:00:26.050" style="s2">conversation or at least a very small</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.279" end="00:00:32.410" style="s2">part of it actually there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.050" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">to say about it which is that and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.410" end="00:00:39.309" style="s2">guess I would also there&#39;s a lot more to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:42.460" style="s2">be said and I would want to really</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.309" end="00:00:46.030" style="s2">separate out over in toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.460" end="00:00:49.780" style="s2">space the stuff that a subset of men do</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.030" end="00:00:52.300" style="s2">that is actually toxic to use this sport</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.780" end="00:00:54.790" style="s2">that is problematic is also problematic</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.300" end="00:00:56.410" style="s2">word now and the things that men are</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.790" end="00:01:00.100" style="s2">more likely to do and that some people</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.410" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">don&#39;t like it but but deal with it right</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.100" end="00:01:05.740" style="s2">so you know being more likely to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:08.289" style="s2">interrupt in a conversation being more</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.740" end="00:01:11.560" style="s2">likely to take risks this is a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.289" end="00:01:13.959" style="s2">masculine way of being on average and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.560" end="00:01:16.149" style="s2">don&#39;t poison us in school boisterous is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.959" end="00:01:17.560" style="s2">also medicated out the boys right very</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.149" end="00:01:19.420" style="s2">much so so that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.560" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">conversation but absolutely the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.420" end="00:01:24.069" style="s2">that the schools are designed for girl</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:25.630" style="s2">ways of learning the schools mostly are</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.069" end="00:01:27.789" style="s2">not designed for boy ways of learning</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.630" end="00:01:29.440" style="s2">and so boys get slapped and corralled</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.789" end="00:01:30.670" style="s2">and told to sit in straight rows and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.440" end="00:01:32.500" style="s2">look forward at the teacher and take</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.670" end="00:01:33.880" style="s2">nice notes what they&#39;re probably closer</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.500" end="00:01:38.500" style="s2">to illegible handwriting than the girls</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.880" end="00:01:43.240" style="s2">have that&#39;s not doing boys any any any</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.500" end="00:01:44.410" style="s2">good so you know the actual toxic male</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.240" end="00:01:47.289" style="s2">behavior so I would say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.410" end="00:01:48.670" style="s2">most men on average will display some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.289" end="00:01:50.470" style="s2">the stuff that most men tell you will</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.670" end="00:01:57.880" style="s2">are more like to be boisterous than most</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.470" end="00:01:59.860" style="s2">women and all of this but but aggressing</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.880" end="00:02:03.429" style="s2">you know being violent aggressing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.860" end="00:02:07.539" style="s2">pushing oh in the sexual sphere this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.429" end="00:02:09.069" style="s2">what toxic masculinity should mean right</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.539" end="00:02:12.909" style="s2">like this this is what that should refer</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.069" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">to so if that&#39;s true then over in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.909" end="00:02:18.460" style="s2">toxic femininity sphere what what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:22.300" style="s2">of things are on average when</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.460" end="00:02:24.370" style="s2">more likely to do but this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.300" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">more feminine a more female way of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.370" end="00:02:30.310" style="s2">they&#39;re more likely to to be in groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">same-sex groups and talk as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.310" end="00:02:33.100" style="s2">do like men are more likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:35.290" style="s2">together and do and women are more</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.100" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">likely to get together and talk I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.290" end="00:02:38.830" style="s2">on average and maybe they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">something at the same time you know some</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.830" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">some kind of craft or or eating together</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:45.700" style="s2">and men are more like like go out and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:46.630" style="s2">play game or build something or fix a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.700" end="00:02:52.150" style="s2">car and that&#39;s you know very</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.630" end="00:02:54.820" style="s2">stereotypical but it&#39;s also true so in</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.150" end="00:02:56.470" style="s2">that talking there is the building of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.820" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">relationship and there is also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.470" end="00:03:00.570" style="s2">building of kind of storytelling some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:04.270" style="s2">which is true and some of which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.570" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">and so people will complain about sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.270" end="00:03:08.260" style="s2">of women tending to be gossipy the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:10.150" style="s2">that will complain about men not sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.260" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">their feelings and I would say those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.150" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">sort of equivalent in terms of like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:14.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just like actually somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:18.190" style="s2">stereotypical feminine or masculine ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.950" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">of being and there we are like we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">continue to talk about it but toxic no</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:25.090" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:27.900" style="s2">by comparison so men are on average</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.090" end="00:03:29.950" style="s2">bigger and stronger and so when they go</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">toxic when they go off the rails they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.950" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">are more likely to go physical and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:42.070" style="s2">society-wide it is easier to point out</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.140" end="00:03:46.540" style="s2">and to make rules against physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.070" end="00:03:49.900" style="s2">violence and so toxic masculinity actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.540" end="00:03:52.690" style="s2">like violence is relatively easy to call</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.900" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">out and you know what the me2 movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.690" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">could have been was a empowering of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.640" end="00:04:07.240" style="s2">people to actually call out real</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">harassment and worse when it happens me</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.240" end="00:04:08.980" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:12.670" style="s2">went off the rails when it could have</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.980" end="00:04:15.910" style="s2">done good in part because of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.670" end="00:04:19.390" style="s2">actually can be toxic in women the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.910" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2">way men can go violent few of them do</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.390" end="00:04:25.030" style="s2">but it&#39;s bad women are much less likely</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">to go physically violent or an average</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.030" end="00:04:28.780" style="s2">smaller and not as strong of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:31.070" style="s2">we&#39;re not as likely to have used</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.780" end="00:04:33.710" style="s2">physical violence as our</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.070" end="00:04:35.180" style="s2">and right men are more likely to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.710" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">used physical violence as their weapon</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.180" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">when they went violent women are much</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:44.300" style="s2">more likely to use wiles and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:48.620" style="s2">because especially for young women that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.300" end="00:04:52.820" style="s2">is where their power is and young women</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:54.620" style="s2">have such vast power over basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.820" end="00:04:57.230" style="s2">every other demographic at least in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.620" end="00:04:58.670" style="s2">American culture in in some cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.230" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">you know in the Far East where elders</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.670" end="00:05:03.200" style="s2">are respected more this is not this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:08.030" style="s2">not going to be the same kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.200" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">but in a culture that has a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.030" end="00:05:16.220" style="s2">amount of freedom to express yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.260" end="00:05:18.680" style="s2">and your identity how you want to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.220" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">who is any young woman who is at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.680" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">close to the beauty norms for her</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:26.990" style="s2">culture and that is it&#39;s probably less</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.020" end="00:05:29.990" style="s2">true than it used to be but it used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.990" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">be most women from you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.990" end="00:05:36.410" style="s2">the ages of fifteen to thirty something</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:39.020" style="s2">like that and you know our diet and Big</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.410" end="00:05:46.340" style="s2">Pharma and such of messed with that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.020" end="00:05:49.760" style="s2">some degree but most young women have</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.340" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">had the revelation sort of whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.760" end="00:05:57.170" style="s2">waking up one day or emerging over</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">several months of I now have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.170" end="00:06:00.860" style="s2">moving around in the world and of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:05.930" style="s2">controlling people that I never had</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.860" end="00:06:07.250" style="s2">before and wow that is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.930" end="00:06:12.620" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what to do with that as</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.250" end="00:06:14.390" style="s2">a power and most women figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.620" end="00:06:16.610" style="s2">deal with it I think and you know make</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.390" end="00:06:19.490" style="s2">some mistakes along the way and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.610" end="00:06:21.110" style="s2">hurt some people but you know it all</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.490" end="00:06:23.320" style="s2">works out in the end people hurt each</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.110" end="00:06:27.800" style="s2">other in relationship with one another</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.320" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">but there is a particular kind of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.800" end="00:06:33.850" style="s2">going to be as explicitly sexual as I</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:36.740" style="s2">possibly can be and then cry foul when</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.850" end="00:06:40.730" style="s2">anyone but perhaps might intend to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.740" end="00:06:43.220" style="s2">target or maybe even anyone says</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.730" end="00:06:44.870" style="s2">anything to me that reveals the truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.220" end="00:06:47.090" style="s2">that we all know which is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.870" end="00:06:49.670" style="s2">you are explicitly sending sexual</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.090" end="00:06:51.110" style="s2">messages constantly and drawing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.670" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">attention of all the straight men in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.110" end="00:06:56.570" style="s2">room and affecting what everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:58.910" style="s2">can do why are we not allowed to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:00.740" style="s2">this it&#39;s you in any room where there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:03.830" style="s2">a beautiful young woman</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:06.950" style="s2">who is actively exposing her sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.830" end="00:07:09.230" style="s2">either through you know phenotype or</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.950" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">behaviorally or usually both it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.230" end="00:07:14.390" style="s2">elephant in the room you never talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:15.860" style="s2">about it never ever it would be rude oh</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.360" end="00:08:02.260" style="s2">point that women do have sexual power</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.300" end="00:08:05.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve had people say it&#39;s not possible</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.420" end="00:08:11.240" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have power and I thought</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.040" end="00:08:21.830" style="s2">and you know the yes rape is older than</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.430" end="00:09:29.090" style="s2">you know Jordan Peterson got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.340" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">flack for his comment in a different New</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.090" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">York Times article about enforced</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:38.690" style="s2">monogamy right and I read that article</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:42.890" style="s2">in forced monogamy that&#39;s really not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.690" end="00:09:44.750" style="s2">term we use much but it is a term over</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.890" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">in evolutionary biology and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.750" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2">concept in evolutionary biology which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">to say monogamy is enforced by women</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:56.570" style="s2">monogamy when it emerges as a social</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:59.030" style="s2">system as a mating system as it has in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.570" end="00:10:00.350" style="s2">not very many mammals lots of birds for</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.030" end="00:10:03.650" style="s2">reasons that we won&#39;t get into here but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.350" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">I find fascinating anyway when mock</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.650" end="00:10:07.460" style="s2">monogamy emerges usually out of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">polygynous system that is in which a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.460" end="00:10:10.250" style="s2">single male mates with multiple females</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:11.690" style="s2">and therefore there are a lot of males</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.250" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">who don&#39;t have any meeting opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.690" end="00:10:17.590" style="s2">at all when monogamy emerges out of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:19.910" style="s2">pledge in a system it is almost always</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.590" end="00:10:21.410" style="s2">when we can figure it out when the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.910" end="00:10:26.390" style="s2">animal behaviors can go in and figure it</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.410" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">out the women who are enforcing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.390" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">monogamy who are preferring a world in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">which there are pair bonds and when one</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:36.440" style="s2">partners and therefore you know help</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:40.130" style="s2">with child care and just having you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.440" end="00:10:41.900" style="s2">partners for everything going forward to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.130" end="00:10:43.970" style="s2">the degree that enforced monogamy is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.900" end="00:10:47.000" style="s2">thing it&#39;s enforced by women it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.970" end="00:10:48.140" style="s2">enforced by men and I know for sure I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.000" end="00:10:50.089" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked with him about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:54.380" style="s2">know for sure that that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.089" end="00:10:56.600" style="s2">Jordan meant by that as well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.380" end="00:10:59.000" style="s2">interesting side effects of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.600" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">conversation not being had in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.000" end="00:11:03.260" style="s2">mainstream and so many things being off</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">topic for the mainstream is that and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.260" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really aware of this until</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">started doing films about sexual</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:10.790" style="s2">dynamics and men and women after me too</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">and some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.790" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">topics that we&#39;ve covered this huge oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:19.940" style="s2">this huge group online sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:22.910" style="s2">different kind of you can say Macau</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.940" end="00:11:24.410" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists like the center</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.910" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">of gravity online especially on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.410" end="00:11:28.280" style="s2">is it is very different from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">mainstream conversation and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.280" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">that because that conversation is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:32.990" style="s2">allowed to be had the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">around some women&#39;s sexual power for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.990" end="00:11:38.900" style="s2">example the only place that exists is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:42.230" style="s2">online and it often goes very toxic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.900" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">not women can behave in these ways women</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.230" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">are people too it becomes women always</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:48.830" style="s2">behave you yeah women always behave in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:51.260" style="s2">these ways women will always look for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.830" end="00:11:53.540" style="s2">man who&#39;s better than you etc etc and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.260" end="00:11:55.400" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating it&#39;s like if this</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.540" end="00:11:58.520" style="s2">because this conversation is not in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.400" end="00:12:00.620" style="s2">in the sunlight it often goes toxic and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.520" end="00:12:02.570" style="s2">then goes really septic it seems oh I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.620" end="00:12:05.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s exactly right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.570" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">that&#39;s very much what&#39;s happening over</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.390" end="00:12:11.540" style="s2">you know so on the on the extreme right</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people making population</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.540" end="00:12:15.290" style="s2">level claims about women and on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:16.820" style="s2">extreme left you have people making</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.290" end="00:12:19.820" style="s2">population level claims about all men</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.820" end="00:12:23.570" style="s2">and both of them are wrong and not to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.820" end="00:12:27.140" style="s2">say that you know all men aren&#39;t more</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.570" end="00:12:28.580" style="s2">likely to display the horrors that some</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.140" end="00:12:29.840" style="s2">men display than they would be to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.580" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">display the horrors that some women</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.840" end="00:12:36.590" style="s2">display while still being very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:40.790" style="s2">unlikely to do so but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.590" end="00:12:43.610" style="s2">this is this is why this is why I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.790" end="00:12:46.250" style="s2">even though I hate the terms this is why</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.610" end="00:12:48.530" style="s2">I wanted to make you know help make sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.250" end="00:12:51.170" style="s2">that there was a term to mirror the one</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.530" end="00:12:53.930" style="s2">that is being paraded around on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.170" end="00:12:55.430" style="s2">if toxic masculinity then okay toxic</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.930" end="00:12:57.230" style="s2">feminine and II and you know what in</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.430" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">both cases hoping that they cancel each</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.230" end="00:13:00.680" style="s2">other out right yeah can can the eight</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">of you over here on the eight of you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.680" end="00:13:04.580" style="s2">over there just you know get together do</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:06.200" style="s2">your awful thing to each other can we</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.580" end="00:13:07.730" style="s2">lock you in a box together and then open</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.200" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">the door in two years and either you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.730" end="00:13:16.190" style="s2">better or you&#39;re dead I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:18.980" style="s2">something but it&#39;s not it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.190" end="00:13:22.580" style="s2">not everyone and it&#39;s not a majority in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.980" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">either group and the mistake is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.580" end="00:13:25.690" style="s2">imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:27.890" style="s2">you know just to take to take the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.690" end="00:13:32.660" style="s2">masculine side for the moment we can do</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.450" end="00:21:37.970" style="s2">a bit off topic but you know as as a as</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.280" end="00:21:40.970" style="s2">a happily married person myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.970" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">just easier it&#39;s it&#39;s far easier to walk</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:45.500" style="s2">into relationships with with with new</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">men like okay I know that whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.500" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">doing there&#39;s we don&#39;t have to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">like is is it this other thing well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:53.150" style="s2">not like you guys like you&#39;re here in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.770" end="00:21:54.560" style="s2">home with my husband and like you talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.150" end="00:21:57.410" style="s2">to him first like that&#39;s that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.560" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">are that&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.410" end="00:22:01.850" style="s2">can have a relationship that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">is you know a bit more like it might</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.850" end="00:22:05.180" style="s2">have been between two women or two men</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.530" end="00:22:07.040" style="s2">but because we&#39;re not actually the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.180" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">sex maybe we can actually do it without</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.040" end="00:22:11.270" style="s2">the compatible combative stuff like more</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:14.180" style="s2">easily maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.270" end="00:22:17.090" style="s2">then two men could or two women could</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.180" end="00:22:19.700" style="s2">whereas we should expect that men are</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.090" end="00:22:21.530" style="s2">you know always sizing each other up to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.700" end="00:22:25.640" style="s2">some degree and women are always sizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.530" end="00:22:27.980" style="s2">each other up to some degree but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.640" end="00:22:30.860" style="s2">should it should be a different less</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.980" end="00:22:33.890" style="s2">fraught set of interactions between men</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.860" end="00:22:36.170" style="s2">and women in some regards you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.890" end="00:22:38.120" style="s2">that we used to have hierarchies male</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.170" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">hierarchies and female hierarchies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.120" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">is or are a lot of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.990" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing at the moment a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:46.730" style="s2">difficulties the results of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.990" end="00:22:49.130" style="s2">those hierarchies together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:52.100" style="s2">can you explain yeah no I mean this this</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.130" end="00:22:54.110" style="s2">is you know I wouldn&#39;t go back and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.100" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">know I&#39;ve taught I&#39;ve talked with some</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.110" end="00:22:58.340" style="s2">very earnest actually young people looks</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:01.790" style="s2">like we just go back to the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:06.950" style="s2">roles it&#39;s like god no like I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.790" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">certainly love for us to to once again</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.950" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">celebrate mother full time motherhood if</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:15.020" style="s2">that&#39;s your choice</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:16.730" style="s2">which seems to many young women seem to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.020" end="00:23:20.510" style="s2">not imagine that that&#39;s even on offer</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:22.670" style="s2">for them but it&#39;s never have been what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.510" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">would have wanted and the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.670" end="00:23:25.220" style="s2">should go back to a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:28.370" style="s2">prescribed in that way that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.220" end="00:23:33.040" style="s2">circumscribed for women in the domestic</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.370" end="00:23:35.330" style="s2">sphere sounds sounds confining at best</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.040" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">so I&#39;m extraordinarily grateful and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.330" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">that&#39;s very new but it came with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:45.410" style="s2">of chaos it came with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:47.540" style="s2">destruction of of sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.410" end="00:23:49.580" style="s2">understanding of okay there are many</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.540" end="00:23:51.020" style="s2">spheres and women&#39;s spheres and women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.580" end="00:23:52.160" style="s2">spheres weren&#39;t entirely domestic there</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.020" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">was plenty of you know there was plenty</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.160" end="00:23:59.570" style="s2">of empowerment but having men and women</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:24:03.010" style="s2">do mostly separate work kept relations</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:08.200" style="s2">between the genders much simpler I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.010" end="00:24:12.830" style="s2">and so this is this is an unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.200" end="00:24:17.660" style="s2">effect of maybe first wave a second wave</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.830" end="00:24:22.190" style="s2">feminism most of the effects for which</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.660" end="00:24:22.940" style="s2">I&#39;m grateful this is a mess and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.190" end="00:24:25.490" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.940" end="00:24:27.800" style="s2">how to carefully get out of it although</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.490" end="00:24:30.820" style="s2">it is clear that those extremes on both</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.800" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">sides are not the right way wherein you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.820" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">demonize an entire population and try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:38.210" style="s2">get them to subjugate themselves to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">and your whims or else they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.210" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">keep yelling at them that&#39;s not going to</p>
