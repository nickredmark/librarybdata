<p begin="00:02:05.390" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">Renaissance the website would have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">filtering system that allowed people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">find groups solving problems they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">most interested in yeah that&#39;d be great</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.870" end="00:02:29.879" style="s2">because right now all the introverts or</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.879" end="00:02:34.739" style="s2">to communicate that video chat is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">way to connect with people because</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.739" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">introverts don&#39;t know that it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">workload on a few people but yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:15.419" style="s2">someone has a job that isn&#39;t remote a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">bowl that would have a little time yeah</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">part of the agenda we can go over those</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.650" end="00:04:39.099" style="s2">and just make sure that that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:41.409" style="s2">and then the right priority order yeah</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a mental health app it is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.640" end="00:06:54.690" style="s2">when it&#39;s working because part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.710" end="00:06:56.970" style="s2">you&#39;re doing courses and you find a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.690" end="00:06:58.260" style="s2">group to communicate about the course so</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.970" end="00:07:00.180" style="s2">you&#39;re put into a group and how they</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.260" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">have the group work is they have Monday</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.180" end="00:07:03.930" style="s2">Tuesday Wednesday Friday and if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:05.190" style="s2">click on one neither says there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.930" end="00:07:07.410" style="s2">one available or there is one available</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.190" end="00:07:08.520" style="s2">they gives it to you in your time right</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.410" end="00:07:10.500" style="s2">so 9:00 a.m. your time there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.520" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">available if they&#39;re none of them work</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.500" end="00:07:14.580" style="s2">for you then you can of course create</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">your own or you can just create your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.580" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">if you if you&#39;d like to I don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not working it wouldn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">let me put myself in a group I have no</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.340" end="00:07:25.980" style="s2">idea what that group looks like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.810" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">know like how they connect via video</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.980" end="00:07:31.770" style="s2">chat but that system of having a problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:34.410" style="s2">or something or a club right a book club</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.770" end="00:07:37.050" style="s2">something and then being able to does</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.410" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">that work there&#39;s something there about</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:41.430" style="s2">having it be just instead of you putting</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:43.560" style="s2">in your entire schedule and having to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.430" end="00:07:45.930" style="s2">match you up which is hard putting in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:48.750" style="s2">topic for either a one-off conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.930" end="00:07:50.610" style="s2">or an ongoing conversation and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.750" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">you can look at any conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.610" end="00:07:58.020" style="s2">going on in this business this specific</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">time or a topic and then you if they</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.020" end="00:08:02.880" style="s2">don&#39;t match up for you you can create</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:04.830" style="s2">another one within that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">and is that more simple then what I had</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.830" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">done on the video</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:15.030" style="s2">I didn&#39;t quite parse that well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.090" end="00:08:17.310" style="s2">he&#39;s saying that sorry he did a five</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.030" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">minute spiel and I realized I wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.310" end="00:08:20.490" style="s2">trying to read something else it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">amazing how the one in the in the app</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.490" end="00:08:25.470" style="s2">worked was just that they had it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:26.640" style="s2">even that great because I had to click</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.470" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">on Monday to see if there&#39;s one on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.640" end="00:08:30.690" style="s2">Monday then Tuesday Tuesday but then it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">would show me a time in my own time zone</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.690" end="00:08:35.520" style="s2">and so I could join that group or I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.050" style="s2">could start my own and so having instead</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.520" end="00:08:39.240" style="s2">of me having to put in my schedule and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.050" end="00:08:42.140" style="s2">then it figuring out people for me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">talk to I can start a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.140" end="00:08:46.410" style="s2">invite people and if people can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.820" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">the comment can&#39;t make the time that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.410" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">have suggested they can start a new time</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:52.830" style="s2">so anyone can either find conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.420" end="00:08:55.530" style="s2">that are happening at the time that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.830" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">they&#39;re available and can either choose</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.530" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">to be part of any of those or start</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:02.970" style="s2">their own or can choose the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s heiner table or a topic you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:06.750" style="s2">can either set a topic and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.280" style="s2">conversation and start that process or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.750" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">find one that&#39;s already it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.280" end="00:09:14.450" style="s2">there because all you need is a topic</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.190" end="00:09:16.710" style="s2">ongoing or one-off and then a time I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.450" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">still kind of prefer the idea of putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.710" end="00:09:23.490" style="s2">in some general availability getting a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:26.460" style="s2">notice when two people&#39;s availabilities</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.490" end="00:09:28.860" style="s2">when they share a topic and their</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.460" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">availabilities overlap and then they</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.860" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">could say whether they&#39;re available for</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:37.050" style="s2">those or anytime in that overlap i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:40.830" style="s2">started to build something a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.050" end="00:09:42.930" style="s2">that in NASH she&#39;s sort of build a proof</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.830" end="00:09:44.310" style="s2">of concept where you can have your</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.930" end="00:09:47.280" style="s2">project you can sort of list what sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.310" end="00:09:49.050" style="s2">of help you need the end goal is to sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.280" end="00:09:50.520" style="s2">of try to build in like this the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.050" end="00:09:51.990" style="s2">solution raising is almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.520" end="00:09:53.100" style="s2">earliest age where you can say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.990" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">the solutions that came out of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.100" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2">here&#39;s the other solutions that we know</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">about just like from projects right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:00.420" style="s2">like here&#39;s the the solution that reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:03.030" style="s2">score is doing here&#39;s the the solution</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.420" end="00:10:04.740" style="s2">that wiki election is doing and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.030" end="00:10:08.280" style="s2">here&#39;s a solution on food that no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.740" end="00:10:09.660" style="s2">tackling yet and then part of it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.280" end="00:10:11.550" style="s2">the projects could sort of say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.660" end="00:10:15.060" style="s2">who&#39;s involved here&#39;s the the help we</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.550" end="00:10:19.320" style="s2">need and then members can go and see</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.060" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">what people need help with is that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.320" end="00:10:23.100" style="s2">that of a thing to do with a scheduling</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:24.180" style="s2">issue or is that just wool so for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.100" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">scheduling part</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.180" end="00:10:28.460" style="s2">I kind of think in like the MVP version</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:31.170" style="s2">we aren&#39;t it like there isn&#39;t gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.460" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">availability there it won&#39;t even be</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.170" end="00:10:35.640" style="s2">smart enough for time zones you&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:38.100" style="s2">say like here&#39;s the session that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.640" end="00:10:39.960" style="s2">doing with how knack works because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.100" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">very sort of like just a database with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.960" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">very simple and then I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.450" style="s2">picturing like different fields that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.029" style="s2">would pick like here&#39;s the time in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.450" end="00:10:50.940" style="s2">Pacific here&#39;s the time and you know UTC</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.029" end="00:10:53.070" style="s2">here&#39;s the time in Australia like in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.940" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">certain Australian time zone just so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.070" end="00:10:56.279" style="s2">that like if you&#39;re use you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.870" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">live in North America</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.279" end="00:11:00.029" style="s2">you&#39;re probably relatively used to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">translating from PST so aureus from</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.029" end="00:11:02.490" style="s2">Pacific time so you might be okay with</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:04.020" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.490" end="00:11:06.170" style="s2">even though it would be ideal for you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.020" end="00:11:08.100" style="s2">put it your own time</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.170" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">put your availability and have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.100" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">translate that to me seems sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:14.430" style="s2">a down the road a nice to have I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:17.310" style="s2">translate time zones quite well in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.430" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">head personally so I think for one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.310" end="00:11:23.339" style="s2">hoping other people can as well so but</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:25.260" style="s2">that would still be one are you expected</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.339" end="00:11:27.480" style="s2">people put in their availability or are</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.260" end="00:11:30.300" style="s2">you suggesting people put in times to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.480" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">have a meeting so the first one did this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.300" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">would sort the thing that I&#39;m building</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">is more project-based right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:38.970" style="s2">we&#39;re having these meetings for this</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2">project right so together tech might</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.970" end="00:11:43.500" style="s2">have this meeting it might have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:45.060" style="s2">project raisins wiki election won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.500" end="00:11:48.150" style="s2">the the live streams that I do on</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.060" end="00:11:50.640" style="s2">Saturdays if you if you do anything sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.150" end="00:11:53.100" style="s2">of on an a recurring basis for four</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.640" end="00:11:55.140" style="s2">reasons core you can put that and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.100" end="00:11:57.480" style="s2">people can go and see a list of either</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">all of the possible sessions or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.480" end="00:12:00.510" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in reason score and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:02.550" style="s2">you&#39;re reading up on it and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.510" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2">you know what recent score needs help</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.550" end="00:12:07.529" style="s2">with and what and maybe what content is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.100" end="00:12:09.450" style="s2">available you can also see hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.529" end="00:12:16.680" style="s2">the regular sessions if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.450" end="00:12:21.029" style="s2">interested in attending those so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:23.130" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that solves the I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.029" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of narrow down the use case</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.130" end="00:12:28.140" style="s2">because we&#39;re kind of conflating the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:30.660" style="s2">team scheduling app with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.140" end="00:12:32.790" style="s2">project raising and this is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.660" end="00:12:34.740" style="s2">raising this project and project raising</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.790" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2">we&#39;re not this this will help with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.740" end="00:12:37.379" style="s2">project raising but starts initial focus</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.839" end="00:12:42.089" style="s2">is my</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.379" end="00:12:44.939" style="s2">understanding what my initial catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.089" end="00:12:46.649" style="s2">for doing it right now was the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.939" end="00:12:49.079" style="s2">was like okay all these people are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.649" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">inside if we have this scheduling what a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.079" end="00:12:52.559" style="s2">great time for people to come on board</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:12:57.449" style="s2">and be able to get to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.559" end="00:12:59.189" style="s2">powerful video is video chat that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.449" end="00:13:01.169" style="s2">experiencing but the outside world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.189" end="00:13:03.059" style="s2">it it&#39;s like its own project in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.169" end="00:13:04.709" style="s2">project so once we have that it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.059" end="00:13:06.029" style="s2">easier to meet on things like hey I need</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.709" end="00:13:07.919" style="s2">help put together tech and finding</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.029" end="00:13:12.239" style="s2">people finding a time that works for</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.919" end="00:13:15.419" style="s2">your team or doing but the use case is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.239" end="00:13:19.559" style="s2">as an individual finding people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.419" end="00:13:24.119" style="s2">connect with by a video chat on topics</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.559" end="00:13:28.919" style="s2">that are important to you and so having</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.119" end="00:13:31.499" style="s2">it be a scheduler that that matches you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.919" end="00:13:32.879" style="s2">up on topics and a schedule that works</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.499" end="00:13:34.679" style="s2">for both of you so whether that means</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.879" end="00:13:37.229" style="s2">like I was saying and I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.679" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">video having individuals put in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.229" end="00:13:41.929" style="s2">schedule and having the match you up or</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:44.669" style="s2">I can put in hey I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.929" end="00:13:46.649" style="s2">climate change at 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.669" end="00:13:47.699" style="s2">and if someone&#39;s like oh yeah climate</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.649" end="00:13:48.809" style="s2">change I want to talk about that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.699" end="00:13:50.549" style="s2">they&#39;re not available at 3:00 p.m. on</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.809" end="00:13:52.289" style="s2">Tuesday because if they are let&#39;s join</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.549" end="00:13:53.759" style="s2">me but if they aren&#39;t they can add it to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.289" end="00:13:56.359" style="s2">they can have a different time on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.759" end="00:14:00.029" style="s2">day or at the same time different day or</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.359" end="00:14:03.499" style="s2">you know and any of the above I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.029" end="00:14:03.499" style="s2">functionally though that&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.949" end="00:14:10.709" style="s2">function except the ones for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.169" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">date rather than maybe repeating because</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.709" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">whether you put in one hour or you put</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:17.039" style="s2">in thirty hours of availability it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:19.709" style="s2">it&#39;s still you&#39;re putting in a time span</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.039" end="00:14:23.459" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I&#39;d like to meet on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.709" end="00:14:26.069" style="s2">topic so functionally I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.459" end="00:14:29.399" style="s2">pretty much similar development efforts</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.069" end="00:14:30.899" style="s2">the issue is if let&#39;s say I put in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.399" end="00:14:32.339" style="s2">schedule and everyone puts in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.899" end="00:14:34.799" style="s2">schedule we want to talk about climate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.339" end="00:14:36.809" style="s2">change then it says okay look there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.799" end="00:14:38.549" style="s2">six of you who have the same schedule</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.809" end="00:14:40.739" style="s2">the same time you can all meet at 2:00</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.549" end="00:14:42.539" style="s2">p.m. on Thursday and then it has to send</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.739" end="00:14:44.699" style="s2">out an invite and people have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.539" end="00:14:47.369" style="s2">and then you create it so it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.699" end="00:14:48.629" style="s2">because we&#39;re not Facebook it has to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.369" end="00:14:50.110" style="s2">email you name me like they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.629" end="00:14:53.080" style="s2">to be checking on it so they gonna know</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.110" end="00:14:55.090" style="s2">if you put in hey I have this one</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.080" end="00:14:57.280" style="s2">blocked off conversation that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.090" end="00:14:59.380" style="s2">have it&#39;s a lot easier to see like is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.280" end="00:15:02.790" style="s2">there zero people or a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.380" end="00:15:05.230" style="s2">who want anything to be part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.790" end="00:15:07.240" style="s2">or did it generate other times right</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.230" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">then I can go back in and be like oh no</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.240" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">one signed up for mine but there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:14.680" style="s2">people who are interested can I sign up</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:16.300" style="s2">for one of theirs and possibly recombine</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.680" end="00:15:17.590" style="s2">right like it that it sees that okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.300" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">leaving this one and going to this one</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.590" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">am I wrong in that that&#39;s an easier app</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:27.210" style="s2">than the one where we put in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:27.210" style="s2">schedules and then it matches us up I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.130" end="00:15:35.200" style="s2">have to hurry adjust my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.750" end="00:15:37.330" style="s2">I think the same like I could pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.200" end="00:15:38.650" style="s2">easily repurpose the scheduling for</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.330" end="00:15:40.750" style="s2">projects to make the project part</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.650" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">optional and to even have like a topic</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.750" end="00:15:46.990" style="s2">or something I guess my point of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:49.240" style="s2">was the first version of this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:50.770" style="s2">think you put your your availability I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.240" end="00:15:52.180" style="s2">think eventually you would because</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.770" end="00:15:54.190" style="s2">that&#39;s important but in version one</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.180" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">where you just need to be able to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.190" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">listings and like have a list of topics</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.950" end="00:16:01.150" style="s2">that people want to meet on and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:02.710" style="s2">proposed time and then people can sign</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.150" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">up for it and sort of say like yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.710" end="00:16:10.360" style="s2">be interested in that I think if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking for I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.360" end="00:16:14.410" style="s2">we need an app I mean I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">do that in an Excel spreadsheet or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.410" end="00:16:22.210" style="s2">Google sheets true yeah which personally</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">I think is how we should start anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.210" end="00:16:25.930" style="s2">right a almost any time that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.540" style="s2">talking about coding something if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.930" end="00:16:30.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have like a live mock-up with at</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.540" end="00:16:33.670" style="s2">least ten users we shouldn&#39;t code</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.280" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">anything well there are some things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.670" end="00:16:39.400" style="s2">that that that you can&#39;t bootstrap that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:42.130" style="s2">way like if if you wanted it to choose</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.400" end="00:16:45.370" style="s2">for people I guess you could write some</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.130" end="00:16:46.960" style="s2">code on them to have a search but having</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.370" end="00:16:49.630" style="s2">an availability and having a find</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.960" end="00:16:51.760" style="s2">availability isn&#39;t something I would do</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">in Google sheets but if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.760" end="00:16:57.700" style="s2">moving into certain times of the product</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.700" end="00:17:01.210" style="s2">think that is in the coded version the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:02.990" style="s2">spreadsheet doesn&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.210" end="00:17:04.579" style="s2">features the spreadsheet just starts</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.990" end="00:17:06.230" style="s2">to collect the people love them saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.579" end="00:17:08.510" style="s2">that there are some minimum viable</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.230" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">products that you cannot do in a goggle</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.510" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">sheet that&#39;s alright okay okay but</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:16.189" style="s2">because some of the other stuff we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:17.809" style="s2">throwing around I can&#39;t imagine how</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.189" end="00:17:19.970" style="s2">you&#39;d do that first to negotiate but if</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.809" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">you&#39;re just putting in dates and times</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.970" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">and topics then we might be able to find</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:25.400" style="s2">a way to organize that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">think of how it would be organized</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.400" end="00:17:29.929" style="s2">though because it could just be you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:33.400" style="s2">a list of topics and then people could</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.929" end="00:17:35.870" style="s2">search and then put in their times yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.400" end="00:17:37.700" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff in the comments sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.870" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">saying like why do you need scheduling I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.700" end="00:17:41.870" style="s2">think once we have a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">theoretically yet you don&#39;t you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.870" end="00:17:44.630" style="s2">scheduling if there&#39;s a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:46.040" style="s2">on the site all looking at different</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.630" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2">topics odds are you&#39;re gonna have you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:49.580" style="s2">know five to ten people interested</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:50.990" style="s2">making just jump into a room but when</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.580" end="00:17:52.550" style="s2">you&#39;re starting with like ten or twenty</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.990" end="00:17:54.070" style="s2">people in order to actually gain</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.550" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">traction and start to have meetings</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.070" end="00:17:57.770" style="s2">especially if we&#39;re across time zones I</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">think you&#39;d still need scheduling</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.770" end="00:18:02.270" style="s2">someone needs to write like this meeting</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:03.620" style="s2">is happening because we scheduled it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.270" end="00:18:07.070" style="s2">the people who are hosting it were able</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.620" end="00:18:08.929" style="s2">to schedule around it no one to join and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.070" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">I think you would need to do that at</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.929" end="00:18:13.010" style="s2">least at the start to get people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">on board to say okay can we all meet at</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.010" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">this time regularly great let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:18.550" style="s2">meeting then and then once that has</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">dealt enough of an audience</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.550" end="00:18:24.890" style="s2">theoretically you can start meeting</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:26.780" style="s2">without a schedule sort of like how you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.890" end="00:18:28.340" style="s2">know people may have some people might</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.780" end="00:18:30.020" style="s2">be watching this or maybe watching</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.340" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">certain live streams just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.020" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">on Facebook and because they saw they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:33.860" style="s2">like oh neat</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:36.830" style="s2">but that&#39;s cos Facebook has so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">people it has that as an option yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.830" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">we we already have an open game be zoom</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">room right and people use that for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.210" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">while but from after a while you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:54.350" style="s2">go there because no one would be there</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to sit on it with it open</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.350" end="00:18:58.040" style="s2">on your computer all the time so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:01.550" style="s2">without scheduling you&#39;re still gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.040" end="00:19:03.500" style="s2">have a very very low you know even with</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.550" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">tens of thousands of people I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know that I would still go there</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:10.580" style="s2">and say okay I want to talk now but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">rather do you know something coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.580" end="00:19:14.630" style="s2">through like so what we tried to do in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:14.780" style="s2">game B in the very beginning right but</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.630" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.780" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">and then you&#39;d go in and no one would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:19.310" style="s2">there but when someone was there it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:22.630" style="s2">really awesome and it was really cool</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.310" end="00:19:25.370" style="s2">for like a week or two having a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.630" end="00:19:27.170" style="s2">scheduling app that just concentrates on</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.370" end="00:19:29.660" style="s2">that so the idea is having a zoom room</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.170" end="00:19:31.430" style="s2">that&#39;s paid for having multiple zoom</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:34.670" style="s2">rooms and then having people vote on</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.430" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">what topic is most relevant or you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.670" end="00:19:39.110" style="s2">like which rooms talking about which</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">which sorry 15 things coming through</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.110" end="00:19:42.650" style="s2">ones having a calendar for each room</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:44.510" style="s2">where someone can say hey this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.650" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">topic that we&#39;re talking about at this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.510" end="00:19:48.110" style="s2">time so come and join and if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:50.120" style="s2">then you might want to have that same</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.110" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">conversation somewhere else right like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.120" end="00:19:53.570" style="s2">at a different time but oh and then if</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2">there&#39;s two happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.570" end="00:19:56.810" style="s2">that&#39;s when you want a second zoom</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:19:58.730" style="s2">account or there&#39;s two conversations</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.810" end="00:20:00.050" style="s2">happy yeah two conversations having</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.730" end="00:20:02.390" style="s2">simultaneous they&#39;re more than 100</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.050" end="00:20:04.870" style="s2">people kazuma can can coordinate a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.390" end="00:20:04.870" style="s2">hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.890" end="00:20:18.250" style="s2">than also potentially reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.620" end="00:20:21.010" style="s2">other communities that could really use</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.250" end="00:20:23.800" style="s2">connection in the in the pandemic to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.010" end="00:20:25.180" style="s2">hey this space is for parents right to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.800" end="00:20:27.430" style="s2">come and talk about parenting during</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.180" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">this time once your kids are in bed cuz</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.430" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">time is all around the world right at</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.380" end="00:20:37.290" style="s2">any different any given time</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:42.190" style="s2">I didn&#39;t or yeah having limits to groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.290" end="00:20:45.400" style="s2">so I know you&#39;re afraid to think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.190" end="00:20:47.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I so he mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.400" end="00:20:49.990" style="s2">that five to ten people group so yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:53.020" style="s2">are hoping to limit each group to four</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.990" end="00:20:55.480" style="s2">right Julie or I mean that number may</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.020" end="00:20:57.610" style="s2">vary but our initial plan is like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.480" end="00:20:59.380" style="s2">know I would really like numbers so</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.610" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">limited to four like even the Omega</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.380" end="00:21:03.910" style="s2">Group this the one that Eric&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:05.320" style="s2">grow there were like seven people that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.910" end="00:21:07.270" style="s2">are this week and it doesn&#39;t work for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.320" end="00:21:09.490" style="s2">I need to have four people having a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.270" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">conversation maximum not all the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.490" end="00:21:12.040" style="s2">said half the people aren&#39;t talking and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just watching they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.040" end="00:21:14.860" style="s2">getting their voice heard I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:16.810" style="s2">heard because I feel like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.860" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">monopolize even a quarter of the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.810" end="00:21:19.540" style="s2">and I want to be able to feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:21.880" style="s2">could invoke once a quarter of the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.540" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">like it just for me it doesn&#39;t but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.880" end="00:21:26.350" style="s2">don&#39;t but at the same time you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.330" style="s2">want to split like six is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.350" end="00:21:29.530" style="s2">splitting point right so you if you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.330" end="00:21:31.570" style="s2">five people okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.530" end="00:21:35.470" style="s2">if you know six people you split into</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.570" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">groups of three and zoom can do that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.470" end="00:21:39.700" style="s2">doing a very beta scheduling app where</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:41.500" style="s2">people can log in because the whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.700" end="00:21:43.210" style="s2">point also is if we&#39;re doing it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.500" end="00:21:44.680" style="s2">with in-game B I feel like we would have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.210" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">gained traction already with the amount</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.680" end="00:21:48.910" style="s2">of things and I put out there that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:51.490" style="s2">very like this right like crickets</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.910" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">so like this isn&#39;t going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.490" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">internal game B thing it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.920" style="s2">that is like for Humanity while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.180" end="00:21:59.710" style="s2">stuck inside during a pandemic to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.920" end="00:22:03.910" style="s2">connect them on topics of interest and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.710" end="00:22:05.650" style="s2">so having it be a very beta youth login</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.910" end="00:22:07.930" style="s2">so you&#39;re not showing up naked and being</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.650" end="00:22:09.370" style="s2">a troll maybe there&#39;s a nudity one I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.930" end="00:22:11.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough people who want</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.370" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">clothing optional options great but like</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.620" end="00:22:14.290" style="s2">you know that it we&#39;re not having the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.360" style="s2">same problems a lot of the stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.290" end="00:22:20.260" style="s2">have an actual account that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.360" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">logging into and then then it it helps</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.260" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">you schedule the conversations right</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">which zoom room am I in as there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">problem with one</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">can we you know buy a new one and add it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">in can someone donate one for six hours</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:34.919" style="s2">per day like all the different um pieces</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.059" end="00:22:36.780" style="s2">but it also didn&#39;t get traction there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.919" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">no one besides this person who was like</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.780" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">yes I can I can create this so maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2">will contact Sam and who is the person</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:56.130" style="s2">from there oh I see ADA went to go get</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:59.490" style="s2">her a package she said and so like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.130" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">just think this is like an a time where</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.490" end="00:23:02.970" style="s2">society can bear you get much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:05.549" style="s2">divided as we already are with toilet</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.970" end="00:23:07.380" style="s2">paper being short and people blaming</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.549" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">everyone else like like I&#39;m healthy so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.380" end="00:23:12.360" style="s2">can get it and like just societies in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:14.700" style="s2">the process of going crazy and so to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:17.480" style="s2">able to offer it some kind of glimmer of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.700" end="00:23:21.809" style="s2">hope that&#39;s available to everyone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.480" end="00:23:25.260" style="s2">not about not about game B but very game</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.809" end="00:23:27.390" style="s2">B I think if you can connect over video</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.260" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">and then it like if it&#39;s simple enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:30.600" style="s2">that anyone can add a zoom right that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:32.429" style="s2">when you have a community when you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.600" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">something that we&#39;re not discussing we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.429" end="00:23:37.620" style="s2">can have the ones that are more um</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:39.240" style="s2">what&#39;s the word like concrete likes</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.620" end="00:23:40.860" style="s2">people want to discuss climate change we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.240" end="00:23:43.289" style="s2">want to discuss parenting people wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.860" end="00:23:46.169" style="s2">to discuss sporting events I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.289" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">having four or five or and then as they</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.169" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">don&#39;t register at that you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:53.789" style="s2">and wants to use them having having them</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:55.830" style="s2">rotating what that topic is right well</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.789" end="00:23:58.710" style="s2">the sports people really do like talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.830" end="00:23:59.850" style="s2">and they show up constantly but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.710" end="00:24:04.169" style="s2">know exactly what that would look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.850" end="00:24:07.530" style="s2">if we&#39;re using it to facilitate a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.169" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">room a cafe but so we can just know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.530" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in which you remote</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:16.860" style="s2">what time and as an individual I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:19.409" style="s2">suggest something or and or join so a to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.860" end="00:24:23.490" style="s2">pass one to put in your availability one</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.409" end="00:24:25.530" style="s2">to just put in a date a time and for</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.490" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">availability I&#39;m thinking it might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.530" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">easiest this may or may not work is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:32.220" style="s2">to say you know for these days of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.120" end="00:24:36.059" style="s2">week for these hours I tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.220" end="00:24:38.370" style="s2">available so that make a rather simpler</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.059" end="00:24:39.270" style="s2">interface rather than having all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.370" end="00:24:41.610" style="s2">options repeat</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.270" end="00:24:43.710" style="s2">monthly days and stuff like that because</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.610" end="00:24:48.690" style="s2">most people have some sort of regular</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.710" end="00:24:49.680" style="s2">weekly schedule but not everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.690" end="00:24:51.900" style="s2">you&#39;re right then we still need a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.680" end="00:24:55.290" style="s2">notification system the other option is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.900" end="00:24:59.250" style="s2">yeah just some place that to list that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.290" end="00:25:02.670" style="s2">you have times and you have dates and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.250" end="00:25:05.730" style="s2">times and topics and then people can</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.670" end="00:25:08.670" style="s2">search and and express interest in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.730" end="00:25:11.040" style="s2">date and time and topic yes - what</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.670" end="00:25:14.040" style="s2">Enrico said yes the idea is anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.040" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">start a group but whatever the beta</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.040" end="00:25:19.470" style="s2">version is is gonna limit that we only</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:21.810" style="s2">have four rooms if we only have light we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.470" end="00:25:23.040" style="s2">need to choose ones that are more that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.810" end="00:25:26.700" style="s2">of a higher threshold of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.040" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">interested yeah although I I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.700" end="00:25:34.740" style="s2">we&#39;re I mean I still don&#39;t think like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">the the feature and zoom of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.740" end="00:25:37.950" style="s2">large group of people and splitting it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.990" style="s2">up into smaller things it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.950" end="00:25:44.820" style="s2">much of a thing the problem is people</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.990" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know when to be together so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.820" end="00:25:47.430" style="s2">guess that does become a problem if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.670" style="s2">get a lot of people but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.430" end="00:25:52.980" style="s2">bigger issue is finding the time to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.670" end="00:25:58.860" style="s2">together rather than splitting up a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.980" end="00:26:01.320" style="s2">large group so I mean even if yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.860" end="00:26:02.730" style="s2">coordinate that but sorry what do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.320" end="00:26:04.140" style="s2">mean by finding the time to be together</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.730" end="00:26:06.810" style="s2">you mean like the scheduling part of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.140" end="00:26:08.010" style="s2">like finding a time that for people I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.810" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how often you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.010" end="00:26:12.690" style="s2">gonna really have four people more than</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:14.750" style="s2">four people who found a time and in just</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.690" end="00:26:20.250" style="s2">any one of them you know someone just</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.750" end="00:26:22.410" style="s2">chooses to create a free zoom account</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.250" end="00:26:28.140" style="s2">and start a room with four people you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.410" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">have 45 minutes on the free version or</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.140" end="00:26:32.370" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re using a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">then the top four people do a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.370" end="00:26:38.460" style="s2">and the fifth person you know goes gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">a free zoom accountant puts in a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.460" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">link into the spreadsheet right</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:49.830" style="s2">it&#39;s just handled by convention is there</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">a way to do this on spreadsheet and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:54.179" style="s2">Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:57.330" style="s2">so that anyone can theoretically join</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.179" end="00:27:01.320" style="s2">the Facebook group to get access to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.330" end="00:27:02.549" style="s2">spreadsheet and can possibly post like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.320" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t want everyone posting I might</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.549" end="00:27:05.250" style="s2">have a conversation this time in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:06.690" style="s2">day that&#39;s not sure we totally do in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.250" end="00:27:08.039" style="s2">beginning but once we have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.690" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">people we don&#39;t want a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.039" end="00:27:11.640" style="s2">posting what they want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:14.190" style="s2">conversation about and it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.640" end="00:27:22.980" style="s2">connect them but having a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.190" end="00:27:24.090" style="s2">that is topic dating time and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.980" end="00:27:26.100" style="s2">gonna have to feel like it&#39;ll be always</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.090" end="00:27:27.809" style="s2">in Pacific Standard Time or always in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.100" end="00:27:29.820" style="s2">GMT time which one you can make the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.809" end="00:27:34.429" style="s2">sense they stopping it in the GMT time</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.820" end="00:27:34.429" style="s2">and then you get to switch it for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.240" end="00:27:40.919" style="s2">so having the time and then you sign up</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.270" end="00:27:42.299" style="s2">for that and then you put the link in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.919" end="00:27:44.130" style="s2">but you want to know people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.299" end="00:27:47.190" style="s2">show up that&#39;s part of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.130" end="00:27:48.780" style="s2">like I put out things that are hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.190" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2">talk about this at this time and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.780" end="00:27:51.960" style="s2">one person might want to I&#39;m not looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:55.049" style="s2">to have a one-on-one conversation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.960" end="00:27:56.190" style="s2">looking to have like it&#39;s which to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.049" end="00:28:00.419" style="s2">this work I would have a one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.190" end="00:28:02.130" style="s2">conversation no problem but the constant</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.419" end="00:28:03.480" style="s2">you&#39;re the only one who shows up and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.130" end="00:28:05.220" style="s2">nobody else shows up and it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.480" end="00:28:05.940" style="s2">constantly just being two of you when</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.220" end="00:28:09.630" style="s2">you&#39;re wanting to have a group</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.940" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">conversation he&#39;s a problem but is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.630" end="00:28:14.370" style="s2">I&#39;m in rambling on is there a way to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:16.919" style="s2">this with a spreadsheet and they so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.370" end="00:28:18.870" style="s2">think you could create a spreadsheet the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.919" end="00:28:23.460" style="s2">first column would be topic second</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.870" end="00:28:28.049" style="s2">column would be dating time and in GMT</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.460" end="00:28:30.690" style="s2">or a Zulu time and and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.049" end="00:28:33.270" style="s2">that third fourth and fifth and six</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.690" end="00:28:36.929" style="s2">columns would be someone marking that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.270" end="00:28:40.679" style="s2">they have an interest right tabs would</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.929" end="00:28:42.990" style="s2">be for date that seems weird or topic</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.679" end="00:28:47.400" style="s2">having four different topics and having</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.990" end="00:28:53.190" style="s2">it be I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see a reason and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.400" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2">breaking it down into tabs just having</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.190" end="00:28:57.929" style="s2">like one tab for topics and then one tab</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">for people who want to sign up and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.929" end="00:29:01.110" style="s2">you can start to get like account for</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:02.520" style="s2">purpose of the could sign up for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.110" end="00:29:03.659" style="s2">same top important ones you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.520" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">hundred people sign up for the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.659" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">topic if you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.580" style="s2">so that&#39;s more than but how are they</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">getting and finding when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.580" end="00:29:13.110" style="s2">available the point is to have a topic</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:14.850" style="s2">and the time there is no way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.110" end="00:29:16.170" style="s2">say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t make this time in</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.850" end="00:29:18.300" style="s2">this topic but I could make any of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.170" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">times you can put out a second one right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.300" end="00:29:21.630" style="s2">I can&#39;t make that but I could make this</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:25.110" style="s2">time and put out a second one but you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.630" end="00:29:26.520" style="s2">can&#39;t really put out a like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.110" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">coordinating people to get together and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.520" end="00:29:30.059" style="s2">have no conversation I have enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:32.040" style="s2">enough going on it&#39;s hard enough to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.059" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">coordinate me having those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.040" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">around my schedule but so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:40.650" style="s2">spreadsheet because what what we would</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:43.080" style="s2">want from the spreadsheet is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:44.910" style="s2">communication that something has</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.080" end="00:29:46.650" style="s2">happened in this topic this time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.910" end="00:29:49.920" style="s2">then how many people are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.650" end="00:29:56.870" style="s2">that how many people are actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.920" end="00:29:56.870" style="s2">show up and be part of it and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.770" end="00:30:02.040" style="s2">because like Facebook becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.059" end="00:30:03.720" style="s2">unmanageable very fast like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.040" end="00:30:05.100" style="s2">people having regular conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.720" end="00:30:07.830" style="s2">almost too much for a spreadsheet to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.100" end="00:30:10.890" style="s2">handle but that&#39;s a good problem to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.830" end="00:30:12.870" style="s2">right when it gets too big for for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.890" end="00:30:16.260" style="s2">but I just like I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.870" end="00:30:19.170" style="s2">offer the world this option even if this</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.260" end="00:30:20.820" style="s2">option is start your own Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.170" end="00:30:22.679" style="s2">around a topic and figure out a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.820" end="00:30:24.540" style="s2">room write about something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.679" end="00:30:28.020" style="s2">important to you that this is an option</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.540" end="00:30:29.670" style="s2">and then creating the parallel platform</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.020" end="00:30:31.110" style="s2">that helps everyone come on to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.670" end="00:30:33.929" style="s2">platform so that everyone can access</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.110" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">this and maybe Facebook takes it on no</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.929" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">something like that which I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">but there&#39;s a post about a question</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:50.130" style="s2">about donation pools and know there&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:52.610" style="s2">the game be group someone&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.130" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">making a generic kind of game be</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.610" end="00:30:58.050" style="s2">crowdfunding platform but we could also</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:31:00.390" style="s2">you know if we wanted to write out a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.050" end="00:31:07.410" style="s2">specification and do a quick video we</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.390" end="00:31:09.210" style="s2">could do a gosh what&#39;s the crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.410" end="00:31:11.390" style="s2">site that they don&#39;t really care what</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.210" end="00:31:11.390" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.050" end="00:31:32.870" style="s2">needs to figure out but we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.670" end="00:31:35.810" style="s2">there yet because we don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.870" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">who are looking to fund us but maybe we</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.750" end="00:32:08.600" style="s2">works I probably first name would would</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:10.430" style="s2">do this once we get past four we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.600" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">because if we have five then we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.430" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">split into groups if we have six we</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">split into groups of three if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.340" end="00:32:17.150" style="s2">like yeah why we hang up to a hundred I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:19.250" style="s2">mean that won&#39;t be a problem I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.150" end="00:32:20.900" style="s2">delete the columns to the right and say</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.250" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">you know once it fills up to four people</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.900" end="00:32:24.740" style="s2">you just stop and the call has and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:26.930" style="s2">just say if there&#39;s not four people</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.740" end="00:32:28.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna have a call or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.930" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">could say three to four or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.040" end="00:32:31.070" style="s2">like that and bring out the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.330" end="00:32:35.000" style="s2">column or you can go to five or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.070" end="00:32:37.220" style="s2">but a good option part of the issue</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.000" end="00:32:38.990" style="s2">though with anyone can post on it can</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.220" end="00:32:41.090" style="s2">say yes there&#39;s the zoom link here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.990" end="00:32:43.280" style="s2">topic here&#39;s the time and I&#39;m a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.090" end="00:32:46.210" style="s2">person coming on or emini coming on</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.280" end="00:32:48.410" style="s2">after people have posted how do I find</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.210" end="00:32:50.870" style="s2">like they&#39;re not in an order that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.410" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">helping me is there a way to export a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.870" end="00:32:56.120" style="s2">spreadsheet to a calendar my guess is no</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:58.310" style="s2">or whatever ago you would sort you would</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:00.830" style="s2">sort by the the columns and the order so</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.310" end="00:33:03.110" style="s2">it&#39;s sort by topic so first you&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.830" end="00:33:04.340" style="s2">look you&#39;d control F to find the topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.110" end="00:33:07.670" style="s2">if you kind of know what the wording is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.340" end="00:33:09.860" style="s2">or you could browse and then you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.670" end="00:33:11.390" style="s2">you know and then didn&#39;t it everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.860" end="00:33:12.920" style="s2">under that topic would be listed I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.390" end="00:33:16.280" style="s2">imagine there&#39;d be more than you know a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.920" end="00:33:18.530" style="s2">page worth of events on any topic and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">then when you&#39;re done or the date passes</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.530" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">you would delete that row</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.990" end="00:33:29.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s also like everything chicken</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.330" style="s2">and eggs like if we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.320" end="00:33:32.830" style="s2">people to try it out then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.330" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">viable like the three of us know when</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.830" end="00:33:35.950" style="s2">we&#39;re having the conversation we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.650" style="s2">need it for the three of us need it for</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.950" end="00:33:40.450" style="s2">like humanity but we don&#39;t need it for</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.650" end="00:33:42.070" style="s2">Humanity because we can&#39;t do it for</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.450" end="00:33:43.210" style="s2">Humanity so like a hundred people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.070" end="00:33:46.059" style="s2">are lonely and want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.210" end="00:33:47.559" style="s2">conversation trained and I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.059" end="00:33:49.750" style="s2">know how to do that that marketing piece</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.559" end="00:33:51.400" style="s2">is broken for every one of the ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.750" end="00:33:54.580" style="s2">have like getting people to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.400" end="00:33:56.230" style="s2">seems to be very very not my talent I</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.580" end="00:33:57.700" style="s2">think you guys mentioned it earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.230" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">the idea of having a Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.700" end="00:34:01.270" style="s2">where just somebody posts and says I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:03.850" style="s2">want to talk about this topic and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.270" end="00:34:05.620" style="s2">that post becomes the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.850" end="00:34:07.540" style="s2">around ok who&#39;s interested in what times</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.620" end="00:34:09.550" style="s2">do we want and blah blah blah and use</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.540" end="00:34:11.020" style="s2">that you know until you get like 10 20</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.550" end="00:34:13.240" style="s2">people and then you can start to figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.020" end="00:34:14.889" style="s2">out ok now with these 10 20 people how</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.240" end="00:34:16.570" style="s2">do we do a spreadsheet right and 10 20</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.889" end="00:34:18.850" style="s2">month might be too low if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.570" end="00:34:20.860" style="s2">bunch of topics but if there&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.850" end="00:34:22.690" style="s2">that seem to resonate especially strong</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.860" end="00:34:23.950" style="s2">that might be fine there&#39;s ten topics</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:25.419" style="s2">you probably won&#39;t like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.950" end="00:34:27.070" style="s2">because you want like a decent size in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.419" end="00:34:29.080" style="s2">each group and then and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.070" end="00:34:30.490" style="s2">start at that point probably build up</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.080" end="00:34:32.080" style="s2">the spreadsheet when you figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.490" end="00:34:33.550" style="s2">people are using it how the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.080" end="00:34:34.990" style="s2">conversations go where they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.550" end="00:34:37.210" style="s2">arrange their time and how often people</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.990" end="00:34:38.590" style="s2">tend to you know oh look at this time</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.210" end="00:34:39.220" style="s2">spot has 20 people so I had its foot</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.590" end="00:34:40.810" style="s2">into groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.220" end="00:34:41.950" style="s2">this time spot there&#39;s been two of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.810" end="00:34:43.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve been trying to meet for four</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.950" end="00:34:48.669" style="s2">weeks what can we do to help those two</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.840" end="00:34:50.859" style="s2">cases so is the idea here to have not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.669" end="00:34:53.560" style="s2">one-off conversation but a weekly</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.859" end="00:34:57.400" style="s2">conversation or a bi-weekly conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.560" end="00:34:59.890" style="s2">I think your original topic was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.400" end="00:35:02.050" style="s2">one-off conversation right but it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:05.740" style="s2">both it was I mean the truth is is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.050" end="00:35:07.510" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for people to jump on board</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.740" end="00:35:08.440" style="s2">to a one-off conversation there don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.510" end="00:35:10.390" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re committing to anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.440" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">at the same time tool to create</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.390" end="00:35:15.310" style="s2">community within the pandemic multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:18.580" style="s2">conversations over a course of time is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.310" end="00:35:21.430" style="s2">going to be much more valuable to people</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.580" end="00:35:22.869" style="s2">but again do they know that poor thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.430" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">are they coming on boards the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.869" end="00:35:30.760" style="s2">both that you do have in fact I like</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:32.020" style="s2">weakly better or bi-weekly like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.760" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">often are you meeting and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.020" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">first one and then you know how many are</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.280" style="s2">there and are you still open right</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">because if you have enough people like</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.280" end="00:35:39.770" style="s2">you have 12 people and we break into</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:41.570" style="s2">groups of four every</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.770" end="00:35:43.730" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want more people right are</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.570" end="00:35:45.170" style="s2">you open to get if you&#39;re not open to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.730" end="00:35:48.619" style="s2">have any people then that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.170" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">delete it off of there well I mean once</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.619" end="00:35:52.430" style="s2">you have the first meeting you could say</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">repeating I think you should take it off</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.430" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">the spreadsheet because you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:58.580" style="s2">any more people but you might be like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.410" style="s2">there might be especially if you&#39;re have</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.580" end="00:36:02.750" style="s2">a paid some account you might be willing</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.410" end="00:36:04.280" style="s2">to have up to 100 people but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.750" end="00:36:05.990" style="s2">going to create the intimate community</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.280" end="00:36:08.540" style="s2">so I like the idea like at the Omega on</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.990" end="00:36:10.130" style="s2">Tuesday getting 1215 people and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.540" end="00:36:12.080" style="s2">breaking off into groups so I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.130" end="00:36:14.180" style="s2">talking to the same community of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.080" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">but not the same people all the time if</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.180" end="00:36:18.050" style="s2">that make sense so I&#39;m not talking to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:21.860" style="s2">the same three or four people but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.050" end="00:36:24.170" style="s2">talking to the same 50 people yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.860" end="00:36:25.400" style="s2">yeah I just I just think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.170" end="00:36:26.750" style="s2">already having trouble of not having</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:28.790" style="s2">enough people in general and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.750" end="00:36:33.410" style="s2">now you&#39;re limiting it down to one hour</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.790" end="00:36:36.950" style="s2">a week and trying to get more people I</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.410" end="00:36:38.930" style="s2">think it&#39;d be better if the system it if</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.950" end="00:36:41.150" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t you know breaking people up</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.930" end="00:36:43.340" style="s2">after they get to the same point of time</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.150" end="00:36:45.550" style="s2">but breaking people up on all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.340" end="00:36:51.260" style="s2">different potential times that they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.550" end="00:36:54.980" style="s2">is it worth it to make this only a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.260" end="00:36:56.090" style="s2">solution raising type cafe so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.980" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">gonna solve all of the problems for</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.090" end="00:36:59.150" style="s2">Humanity but there isn&#39;t a single person</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:03.380" style="s2">that I know of who doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.150" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">something so having it be a actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.380" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">project-based conversation where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:11.330" style="s2">first one is that solution right like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:13.160" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re in some you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.330" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">you&#39;re talking with people on education</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.160" end="00:37:16.820" style="s2">and forming a group around that and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">continuing on having that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.820" end="00:37:22.010" style="s2">until you feel you&#39;ve done all you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:24.470" style="s2">do I&#39;m completely pivoting and changing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.010" end="00:37:26.869" style="s2">the entire point all right yeah stronger</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.470" end="00:37:28.670" style="s2">because if if you can say like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.869" end="00:37:31.100" style="s2">the time here&#39;s the topic and people can</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.670" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">vote on the topic I think it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.100" end="00:37:33.650" style="s2">say yes to something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:35.180" style="s2">concrete that you&#39;re like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.650" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">time here&#39;s this do on in or not and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.180" end="00:37:38.540" style="s2">like here&#39;s the topics that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:44:15.980" end="00:44:22.220" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the same I&#39;m not requiring</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.799" end="00:44:38.510" style="s2">together tech it&#39;s that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.470" end="00:44:41.329" style="s2">because that&#39;s sort of what the game B</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.510" end="00:44:42.920" style="s2">project space is and solution raising is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.329" end="00:44:45.410" style="s2">sort of the first part of the together</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.920" end="00:44:49.150" style="s2">tech you know solution to project</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.410" end="00:44:51.349" style="s2">actually working on the project funnel</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.150" end="00:44:53.030" style="s2">there&#39;s like both wait because one we</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:02.599" style="s2">really participating there&#39;s a handful</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.740" end="00:45:04.790" style="s2">of other people are participating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.599" end="00:45:06.380" style="s2">idea is that people in game behalf</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.790" end="00:45:07.849" style="s2">project so why are we not coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.380" end="00:45:09.890" style="s2">together and creating on UN solutions</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.849" end="00:45:11.240" style="s2">there&#39;s also people outside of game</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.890" end="00:45:13.490" style="s2">you&#39;ve never even heard of game B you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.240" end="00:45:15.369" style="s2">have projects that I have been inviting</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.490" end="00:45:19.069" style="s2">but I&#39;m suggesting come and be part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.369" end="00:45:23.780" style="s2">game B projects but I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.069" end="00:45:25.579" style="s2">being game be projects because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.780" end="00:45:27.290" style="s2">big enough to stand on our own it the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.579" end="00:45:28.099" style="s2">only reason I don&#39;t is just because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.290" end="00:45:30.170" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.099" end="00:45:32.210" style="s2">involved as soon as you see game B</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.170" end="00:45:34.369" style="s2">projects that starts the squirrel</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.210" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">conversation of what&#39;s game B and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.369" end="00:45:39.109" style="s2">you you know you kind of you might lose</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:40.790" style="s2">people as far as they get distracted and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.109" end="00:45:42.950" style="s2">go and do other stuff but if it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.790" end="00:45:44.690" style="s2">own thing of a standalone and you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.950" end="00:45:45.799" style="s2">to be called together tech but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.690" end="00:45:47.210" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t reference</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.799" end="00:45:48.380" style="s2">anything else and we&#39;re saying hey come</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.210" end="00:45:49.579" style="s2">and be a part of this their solution</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.380" end="00:45:52.010" style="s2">rating and projects and we&#39;re doing all</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.579" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">the stuff that idea is standalone and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.010" end="00:45:59.720" style="s2">the page is standalone I like both ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:02.150" style="s2">because I think that it might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.720" end="00:46:04.069" style="s2">asking the game be people like do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.150" end="00:46:08.599" style="s2">have to have game be in the name for it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.069" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">to be on the page okay that&#39;s why Cuba</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.599" end="00:46:16.369" style="s2">2.0 named it till I can&#39;t beat Cuba 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:18.349" style="s2">having projects come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.369" end="00:46:21.020" style="s2">Omni win solutions is already very game</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.349" end="00:46:22.280" style="s2">B we&#39;re like yes I get B we need to run</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.020" end="00:46:23.630" style="s2">the people need to understand game B</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.280" end="00:46:25.069" style="s2">before they come on for but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.630" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">time I don&#39;t want someone coming on</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.069" end="00:46:31.730" style="s2">board and not understanding not game B</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:33.170" style="s2">but like why baby right well I we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.730" end="00:46:34.460" style="s2">talked about the thing with together</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.170" end="00:46:36.380" style="s2">tech is like we all sort of have our</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.460" end="00:46:38.450" style="s2">ideas and we seem to be you know in sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.380" end="00:46:40.280" style="s2">of unison on it&#39;s Omni when and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.450" end="00:46:42.619" style="s2">various different pieces so we just</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.280" end="00:46:43.250" style="s2">explained knows cuz I mean I&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.619" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">many converse</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.250" end="00:46:47.570" style="s2">Shinzon the game bSpace that go you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:49.610" style="s2">that goes super deep and people talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.570" end="00:46:52.280" style="s2">about it and novels are written about</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.610" end="00:46:53.300" style="s2">like what is game B people won&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.280" end="00:46:55.670" style="s2">that much if we&#39;re just trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.300" end="00:46:58.010" style="s2">like hey do you want to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.670" end="00:46:59.510" style="s2">session to talk about this there should</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.010" end="00:47:01.220" style="s2">probably be some kind of an intro like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.510" end="00:47:03.620" style="s2">hey we Romney win and it&#39;s this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.220" end="00:47:06.020" style="s2">not for profit or whatever phrases we</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.620" end="00:47:07.820" style="s2">choose to use to describe that group we</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.020" end="00:47:09.740" style="s2">can sort of choose which elements of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.820" end="00:47:15.230" style="s2">game B we think we should focus on and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.740" end="00:47:17.540" style="s2">just do that but again that is if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.230" end="00:47:18.860" style="s2">have to keep game B in the name right</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.540" end="00:47:21.410" style="s2">now that does seem like kind of the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.860" end="00:47:24.520" style="s2">spot to get people interested because</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.410" end="00:47:28.430" style="s2">that is the most alignment and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.520" end="00:47:32.180" style="s2">no yeah I think we&#39;d look into changing</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.430" end="00:47:33.530" style="s2">it once it becomes an issue I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.180" end="00:47:35.150" style="s2">think there&#39;s a problem either way I</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.530" end="00:47:36.920" style="s2">think right now we can just invite</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.150" end="00:47:39.500" style="s2">people to projects whether they&#39;re game</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.920" end="00:47:41.900" style="s2">B or not if they have a project and or</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.500" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">they want to find a project and then if</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.900" end="00:47:44.870" style="s2">from there they find they game be space</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:46.820" style="s2">great or people from game B find it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.870" end="00:47:48.470" style="s2">which is much more of the arrow that it</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.820" end="00:47:49.550" style="s2">goes towards and I don&#39;t think again</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.470" end="00:47:51.080" style="s2">which is why I don&#39;t think we&#39;re big</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.550" end="00:47:54.260" style="s2">enough to stand on our look on our own</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.080" end="00:47:57.320" style="s2">is people know game B they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.260" end="00:47:58.430" style="s2">together tech and having a meta project</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.320" end="00:48:00.500" style="s2">of people being able to come together</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.430" end="00:48:03.170" style="s2">just like game B&#39;s the best branding for</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.500" end="00:48:05.990" style="s2">it at the moment and once there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.170" end="00:48:07.340" style="s2">of us coordinating and it&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.990" end="00:48:10.340" style="s2">the meta project that is together tech</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.340" end="00:48:11.960" style="s2">then um then it involves its own right</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.340" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">if the three of us are deciding it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.960" end="00:48:17.750" style="s2">was not yeah matter project it&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:19.970" style="s2">guess we might get was like if we keep</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.290" end="00:48:56.849" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that either game B</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2">projects or together tech face</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.849" end="00:49:02.489" style="s2">group is the Facebook group that is the</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.900" end="00:50:01.559" style="s2">build the like okay they&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.579" end="00:50:03.150" style="s2">sort of end to end start with the what</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.559" end="00:50:04.259" style="s2">are you trying to solve and then going</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.150" end="00:50:06.989" style="s2">into the projects and so on</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.259" end="00:50:08.339" style="s2">so I think the the separation is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.989" end="00:50:10.739" style="s2">something like the solution everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.339" end="00:50:12.989" style="s2">as we&#39;ve done so far that does seem game</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.739" end="00:50:14.789" style="s2">B projects if we&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.989" end="00:50:17.339" style="s2">an open conversation around whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.789" end="00:50:18.450" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not that can but I also</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.339" end="00:50:19.829" style="s2">don&#39;t do don&#39;t think that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.450" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">something like a solution that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.829" end="00:50:24.390" style="s2">conversation I think also though like if</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:27.329" style="s2">it&#39;s tied to the Facebook group on</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.390" end="00:50:28.859" style="s2">projects we already don&#39;t have that many</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.329" end="00:50:30.930" style="s2">people without projects who are there</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.859" end="00:50:33.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s the point is like anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.930" end="00:50:35.400" style="s2">be part of this and so it is the funnel</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.630" end="00:50:36.869" style="s2">it could be the funnel but I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.400" end="00:50:39.479" style="s2">designing it in the place it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.869" end="00:50:41.009" style="s2">funnel possibly to isn&#39;t because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.479" end="00:50:45.420" style="s2">like you have the conversation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.009" end="00:50:46.710" style="s2">no kind of stress on you have to come up</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.420" end="00:50:48.539" style="s2">with a solution you&#39;re gonna work on</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.710" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">this is like a place to play and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.539" end="00:50:51.559" style="s2">look what we could come up with in and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:54.539" style="s2">out or imagine if we were able to create</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.559" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">working groups and hey we could also do</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.539" end="00:50:57.690" style="s2">that like we can actually have if</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:50:59.999" style="s2">something was generated within a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.690" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">conversation and you want to actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.999" end="00:51:03.779" style="s2">have it be actionable how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">in the world how do we get 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.779" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">hundred dollars once you&#39;ve had you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:08.670" style="s2">a bunch of these and that same question</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">has come up and then it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.670" end="00:51:13.299" style="s2">project under the projects right</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:14.979" style="s2">either the individual project or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.299" end="00:51:17.890" style="s2">project of how do we facilitate these</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.979" end="00:51:19.299" style="s2">conversations and facilitate a project</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.890" end="00:51:27.579" style="s2">that is created from them from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.299" end="00:51:29.170" style="s2">ground up through conversation I just</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.579" end="00:51:33.220" style="s2">talked myself into creating yet another</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.170" end="00:51:34.900" style="s2">Facebook group I already created one</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.220" end="00:51:36.279" style="s2">this week on Kyle sees where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.900" end="00:51:37.450" style="s2">hilarious cuz everyone it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.279" end="00:51:38.739" style="s2">version don&#39;t let that then they work</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.450" end="00:51:40.359" style="s2">for him I&#39;m like we&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.739" end="00:51:42.670" style="s2">figure out coaching without a central</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.359" end="00:51:44.680" style="s2">leader if you don&#39;t want the like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.670" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">is not high school I just can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.680" end="00:51:51.700" style="s2">drama not doing the drama posed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:58.479" style="s2">men to go back to the question before</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.700" end="00:51:59.950" style="s2">you in a Lagasse you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.479" end="00:52:02.410" style="s2">starting a new group that we can call</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.950" end="00:52:04.150" style="s2">whatever that we move solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.410" end="00:52:05.650" style="s2">to and then the idea is if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.150" end="00:52:07.450" style="s2">wants to start a solution you say great</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.650" end="00:52:10.089" style="s2">by the way if you&#39;re interested head</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:11.799" style="s2">over there like head over to projects if</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.089" end="00:52:14.799" style="s2">you want help and if you want this sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.799" end="00:52:16.210" style="s2">of environment but then there&#39;s a page</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.799" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">for sort of both types of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.210" end="00:52:21.579" style="s2">just to like casually discussing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:23.739" style="s2">and then actually sort of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.579" end="00:52:28.599" style="s2">with the purpose of hopefully get a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.739" end="00:52:32.170" style="s2">solution I sorry I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.599" end="00:52:34.239" style="s2">understand but a Facebook group that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.170" end="00:52:36.249" style="s2">facilitating that anyone can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.239" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">a conversation not when we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.249" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">solution raising its particular together</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:40.660" style="s2">tech is doing them we&#39;re following that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.400" end="00:52:43.029" style="s2">format we&#39;re trying to figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.660" end="00:52:45.430" style="s2">format and probably at least one of us</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.029" end="00:52:48.190" style="s2">is participating and it&#39;s recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.430" end="00:52:49.390" style="s2">put on our YouTube channel the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.190" end="00:52:51.339" style="s2">Facebook group is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.390" end="00:52:53.559" style="s2">broadcast anyone can participate will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.339" end="00:52:56.319" style="s2">a zoom call we&#39;re coordinating that but</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.559" end="00:52:58.450" style="s2">also if you want to record and pick and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:53:00.219" style="s2">post here right what these solutions are</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.450" end="00:53:01.719" style="s2">and how do we how do we do coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.219" end="00:53:03.460" style="s2">that right maybe there&#39;s one posting for</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.719" end="00:53:10.479" style="s2">food and one for this and keep posting</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.460" end="00:53:12.309" style="s2">videos under that yeah okay a separate</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.479" end="00:53:15.999" style="s2">Facebook group for the like non and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.309" end="00:53:19.269" style="s2">solution emphasis type conversations no</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.999" end="00:53:20.680" style="s2">solution raising is still the those are</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.269" end="00:53:22.690" style="s2">the conversations are facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.680" end="00:53:23.790" style="s2">they&#39;re just not solution raisings of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.690" end="00:53:26.340" style="s2">together tech is doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.790" end="00:53:28.650" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the true crowd-sourced</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.340" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">hey do you have a topic you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.650" end="00:53:32.220" style="s2">have a solution on how do we help you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:33.600" style="s2">coordinate a group to do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:34.920" style="s2">even if we&#39;re not there how do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.600" end="00:53:37.590" style="s2">facilitate that and how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.920" end="00:53:40.230" style="s2">hundreds of people hopefully participate</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.590" end="00:53:41.670" style="s2">in it so that everyone feels empowered</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.230" end="00:53:43.500" style="s2">to create solutions together to actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.670" end="00:53:44.370" style="s2">talk on video chat and have the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.500" end="00:53:46.170" style="s2">validation</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.370" end="00:53:47.790" style="s2">once the conversations are still in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.170" end="00:53:55.770" style="s2">context of trying to find a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.790" end="00:53:58.050" style="s2">something and beyond like the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.770" end="00:54:00.770" style="s2">pick topics that are problematic in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.050" end="00:54:03.000" style="s2">society that needs solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.770" end="00:54:05.130" style="s2">facilitate conversations under the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.000" end="00:54:06.600" style="s2">umbrella of that problem that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.130" end="00:54:09.480" style="s2">coming up with solutions for so one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.600" end="00:54:11.400" style="s2">the easiest points to get into is to try</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.480" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">a solution raising yourself right tried</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.400" end="00:54:15.750" style="s2">to come up with solutions within it many</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.510" style="s2">of them aren&#39;t going to work many of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.750" end="00:54:20.730" style="s2">them are gonna have possibly like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.510" end="00:54:22.530" style="s2">think any group on part of em is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.730" end="00:54:24.450" style="s2">have a solution we&#39;re probably all like</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.530" end="00:54:25.650" style="s2">that but there might be four people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.450" end="00:54:27.030" style="s2">get together who are waiting for someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.650" end="00:54:29.720" style="s2">else to help with all the solutions I</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.030" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know and that&#39;s part of trying is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.720" end="00:54:34.530" style="s2">facilitating conversations empowering</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.820" style="s2">people and giving them a project because</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.530" end="00:54:38.250" style="s2">that is how you create community and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.820" end="00:54:40.410" style="s2">help people have personal growth is like</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.250" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">you figure out your that some</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:42.600" style="s2">people don&#39;t know how to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.280" style="s2">their doing it in a group setting</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.600" end="00:54:47.930" style="s2">when you have a project work through is</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.280" end="00:54:50.010" style="s2">like ideal there&#39;s so many reasons you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.930" end="00:54:52.230" style="s2">feel that was not the vision of the game</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.010" end="00:54:53.880" style="s2">to this hour it was just conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.230" end="00:54:57.720" style="s2">any conversation I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.880" end="00:54:59.640" style="s2">sports or your show last night but we</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.720" end="00:55:02.340" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of ways that&#39;s harder -</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.640" end="00:55:03.930" style="s2">harder to coordinate so having a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.340" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">Facebook group so we do have a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.930" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">group but then it&#39;d be like comment</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:08.760" style="s2">video chats about everything and it all</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:11.700" style="s2">it everything under the Sun it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.760" end="00:55:13.950" style="s2">medium to you is too much whereas people</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.700" end="00:55:15.840" style="s2">feeling the stress that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.950" end="00:55:17.580" style="s2">feeling for decades of like our world is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.840" end="00:55:20.940" style="s2">falling apart this is like touching</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.580" end="00:55:22.680" style="s2">every different area uh-huh having</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.940" end="00:55:24.180" style="s2">people from that space be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.680" end="00:55:26.460" style="s2">empowered find their group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.180" end="00:55:30.060" style="s2">connect or video chat and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.460" end="00:55:31.770" style="s2">actual solutions is to me what shifted</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.060" end="00:55:34.110" style="s2">during this hour and now that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.770" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">want to get in on stir the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.110" end="00:55:37.590" style="s2">humanity where the problem solvers and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:51.230" style="s2">how do we connect them</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.590" end="00:55:51.230" style="s2">I love those have you met conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.270" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">whoever said this yes that would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.310" end="00:56:01.830" style="s2">awesome however also we&#39;re not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:03.810" style="s2">I think that is part of like having</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.830" end="00:56:05.340" style="s2">people conversations are we are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.810" end="00:56:06.660" style="s2">record them are they gonna be posted as</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.340" end="00:56:08.280" style="s2">a very one-off thing saying with is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.660" end="00:56:11.490" style="s2">there an artist here who can draw</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.280" end="00:56:13.230" style="s2">something up eventually having that be</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.490" end="00:56:14.970" style="s2">part of the process or if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.230" end="00:56:17.880" style="s2">single solution raising like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.970" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">food and then you have every individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.880" end="00:56:23.700" style="s2">group creating a solution then working</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.240" end="00:56:25.320" style="s2">through a process to actually showcase</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.700" end="00:56:26.550" style="s2">that solution like we&#39;ve yet to come up</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.320" end="00:56:28.860" style="s2">with an actual solution during</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.550" end="00:56:32.040" style="s2">solutionizing we come up with dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.860" end="00:56:33.930" style="s2">solutions right that are like not really</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.040" end="00:56:35.430" style="s2">looked into think about how long the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.930" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">conversation for just the schedule a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.430" end="00:56:39.330" style="s2">like it could do this and it could do</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">that being able to actually say yes this</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.330" end="00:56:46.200" style="s2">is enough of a kernel to want to give it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:48.060" style="s2">back to want to report it to the group</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.200" end="00:56:50.250" style="s2">right to say hey who wants to work on</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.060" end="00:56:52.110" style="s2">this and then other people can generate</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.250" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">conversations from that conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.110" end="00:56:57.690" style="s2">start again at zero right and yes then</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:57:00.810" style="s2">it will come up naturally I&#39;m hoping of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.690" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">like how do we take notes of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.810" end="00:57:06.060" style="s2">conversations how do we actually pass</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:07.320" style="s2">this information back to the group but</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.060" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">the bigger deal is that people get</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.320" end="00:57:10.260" style="s2">together and realize that in groups of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:11.400" style="s2">four they can come up with a solution so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.260" end="00:57:17.910" style="s2">why aren&#39;t we doing this on a massive</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.400" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">scale like honestly once we have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.910" end="00:57:22.950" style="s2">platform on humanity where you can log</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:26.130" style="s2">in and have a conversation that has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.950" end="00:57:28.440" style="s2">real impact to be able to create tasks</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.130" end="00:57:31.710" style="s2">like anyone can do and follow through on</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.440" end="00:57:35.550" style="s2">those tasks and hire people to do the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.710" end="00:57:37.260" style="s2">other parts this all happens so very</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.550" end="00:57:39.450" style="s2">fast but getting to that point when we</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.260" end="00:57:41.610" style="s2">have zero people and zero with four</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.450" end="00:57:42.870" style="s2">people but like not enough people to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.610" end="00:57:45.540" style="s2">the work not enough money to pay people</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.870" end="00:57:46.800" style="s2">who would be willing to do the work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.540" end="00:57:48.570" style="s2">a much slower process or figuring how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.800" end="00:57:51.600" style="s2">do it on the current on current tech and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.570" end="00:57:58.050" style="s2">I think we&#39;re doing a pretty good job</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.600" end="00:58:01.500" style="s2">Facebook in a spreadsheet you know the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.050" end="00:58:03.900" style="s2">other group is going off can be so much</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.500" end="00:58:10.320" style="s2">less drama and people who need coaching</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.900" end="00:58:14.250" style="s2">turns out who would have thought oh all</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.320" end="00:58:18.630" style="s2">right I have my solution raising in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.250" end="00:58:20.310" style="s2">hour and my brain needs a break so does</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.630" end="00:58:22.950" style="s2">anyone have us have anything else they</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.310" end="00:58:26.580" style="s2">would like to add to the conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.950" end="00:58:28.680" style="s2">should we and here nope that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.580" end="00:58:31.740" style="s2">ending point all right so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.680" end="00:58:32.850" style="s2">create a Facebook group and once people</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.740" end="00:58:34.320" style="s2">are in the Facebook group we&#39;ll figure</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.850" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">out how to make a spreadsheet to</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.320" end="00:58:41.390" style="s2">facilitate the process all right I</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.390" style="s2">Facebook by YouTube</p>
