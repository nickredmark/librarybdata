<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:09.290" style="s2">this conversation turns out to be about</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">voice about what it is to give voice and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.290" end="00:00:16.049" style="s2">to have voice to share voice whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.549" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">you&#39;re watching on YouTube or listening</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.049" end="00:00:20.300" style="s2">as a podcast remember to subscribe and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">hit the bell to track upcoming releases</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.300" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">so no it&#39;s really as easy as that now</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">there are these cameras recording us and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">we&#39;re recording our voices into some</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">microphones and after just meeting each</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">other we&#39;re now going to what have some</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">kind of conversation and the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">always find interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:42.770" style="s2">feeling away into a space of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">authenticity despite the fact or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.770" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">you know almost taking that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">the fact of a process of a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:55.289" style="s2">kind of authenticity almost it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">adapting to a new container adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.289" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">a different context and you know all I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">can say is I&#39;m really happy to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">this with you I&#39;m delighted to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">this time so really thank you for being</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">here with me well likewise Tim it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">really great and I love your setup here</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">and I&#39;m just remembering you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">filmmaker when I got started the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">equipment that I had to lug around and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">to think that this is this the way we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">can do a studio now and and just how</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">easy it is how light it is how it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">cheap but it&#39;s not a nearly as expensive</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">as it once was and what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:42.630" style="s2">different conversations and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:45.450" style="s2">different we are actually able to engage</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.630" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">with things like public discourse now</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">and how that&#39;s changing the tone of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">so when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:56.570" style="s2">authenticity this you know the equipment</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.710" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">in you know sort of Marshall McLuhan</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.570" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">words the medium is the message and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">medium is now that much more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">and accessible and therefore the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">production and the the being in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:12.670" style="s2">medium is also able to be more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:16.900" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.670" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah I definitely notice finding</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">a certain familiarity in it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">almost a freeing sense I feel yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:27.400" style="s2">leading up to it there&#39;s an anticipation</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">which feels a little bit disjunctive</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.400" end="00:02:31.450" style="s2">almost perhaps as though I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:32.890" style="s2">preparing for a sport game or something</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.450" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">like that I always wonder about football</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.890" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">players training and I wonder do they</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">play their best football in training or</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">do they play their best football on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">pitch and it&#39;s like well on the pitches</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">where it really matters and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.620" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">sense that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:51.700" style="s2">but what is how much does that container</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">enable a certain kind of something and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.700" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">then how do we make sense of what takes</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:03:01.390" style="s2">place in front of the camera relative to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:03.220" style="s2">the various processes and ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.390" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">context in which we&#39;re embedded which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.220" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">our lives and those things we care about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">and those things we aren&#39;t aware about</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:12.549" style="s2">which are having influence on us and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:14.950" style="s2">some broad multi level Gestalt of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.549" end="00:03:17.079" style="s2">world that feels sometimes strange and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.950" end="00:03:20.590" style="s2">absurd but ultimately something that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.079" end="00:03:22.510" style="s2">love and want to see somehow better</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.590" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">itself to be in a to be in a loving</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.510" end="00:03:27.700" style="s2">relationship with and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:30.130" style="s2">orientation in that spaces it&#39;s strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.700" end="00:03:32.620" style="s2">it does feel like some kind of does feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.130" end="00:03:35.799" style="s2">like some kind of new frontier you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.620" end="00:03:37.780" style="s2">done a lot of these appearances over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.799" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">last few months I&#39;ve I&#39;ve noticed online</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.780" end="00:03:42.340" style="s2">of future thinkers as well as James is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:43.989" style="s2">the gloaming podcast and I think a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.340" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">others emerge with Daniel sourcing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:49.090" style="s2">well who I&#39;ve spoken to a few times</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:52.570" style="s2">what&#39;s being the catalyst for you sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.090" end="00:03:54.850" style="s2">of taking that kind of a bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.570" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">public-facing you&#39;ve always been a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.850" end="00:03:57.819" style="s2">public fight you&#39;ve done plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:00.370" style="s2">things and you&#39;ve spoken about them but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.819" end="00:04:02.019" style="s2">there seems to be am I to my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.370" end="00:04:06.609" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of a development recently</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.019" end="00:04:08.829" style="s2">among a few kind of avant-garde type</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.609" end="00:04:12.130" style="s2">intellectuals who are sort of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.829" end="00:04:14.019" style="s2">forward and finding each other there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.130" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2">like a there&#39;s like a sort of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.019" end="00:04:17.799" style="s2">systems thinking approach underlying</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.970" end="00:04:19.329" style="s2">much of it there&#39;s this emphasis of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.799" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">importance of contacts and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.329" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">relationship and there&#39;s a sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">gathering of people finding each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">for what we&#39;re not sure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.020" style="s2">almost there</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2">questions who ask apart from when voiced</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.020" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">in a certain contextual way so I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">why do you feel drawn to be speaking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">all in this kind of setting the why is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:47.230" style="s2">is more difficult to get to than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">sort of what&#39;s been interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.230" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">around this is actually finding a voice</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.890" style="s2">and you were saying that you had watched</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:05:00.270" style="s2">my film last night yes and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.890" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">sort of hilarious history to that film</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:08.410" style="s2">which is that it&#39;s a film about my dad</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:10.419" style="s2">and so much of the film is about</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s about systems thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.419" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">about complexity it&#39;s about interrelated</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">interdependent systems through this lens</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:23.830" style="s2">of a father and daughter relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:26.590" style="s2">okay so there was no way to really talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.830" end="00:05:30.220" style="s2">about those ideas without getting into</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.590" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">the sort of first rule of second order</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.220" end="00:05:33.990" style="s2">cybernetics which is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:38.460" style="s2">observe the observer the observer</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.990" end="00:05:41.290" style="s2">matters okay so then I as a filmmaker</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.460" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">was in a bit of a conundrum with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.290" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">process of how do I have a voice here</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">and what is that voice and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:54.370" style="s2">know ago looking into this the genre and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">the move of documentary films and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:06:00.310" style="s2">narration processes and this and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re all very disembodied and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.310" end="00:06:08.380" style="s2">they aren&#39;t vulnerable they you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:10.360" style="s2">the process of talking about science or</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.380" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">philosophy or ideas has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.360" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">specifically about not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:19.660" style="s2">intimate personal emotional</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">vulnerability and and through those</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.660" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">stories and through that even just the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.700" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">the tenderness of the human voice um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:34.570" style="s2">the spaces between words where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.789" style="s2">know what you&#39;re going to say like those</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.570" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">are important that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.789" end="00:06:42.250" style="s2">information okay this is the warm data</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:45.610" style="s2">this is the warm data so how do we tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.250" end="00:06:48.340" style="s2">this story and include the warm data</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.610" end="00:06:50.980" style="s2">when what&#39;s going to happen is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.340" end="00:06:54.730" style="s2">generating a different set of tonality</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.980" end="00:06:57.130" style="s2">Xand expectations from something that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.730" end="00:06:59.740" style="s2">was once called an audience I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.130" end="00:07:01.090" style="s2">if it still is we don&#39;t know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.740" end="00:07:07.180" style="s2">debatable</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.090" end="00:07:11.310" style="s2">but changing the rhythm changing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.180" end="00:07:16.570" style="s2">texture changing the tone so that that</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.930" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">have to go through quite a few had had</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.150" end="00:08:11.590" style="s2">to practice you know because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.410" style="s2">know what that voice spelter looked like</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.410" end="00:08:22.150" style="s2">didn&#39;t know because it&#39;s it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.540" end="00:08:24.810" style="s2">same time an intellectual process as it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:28.180" style="s2">is an emotional exploration as it is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.810" end="00:08:31.570" style="s2">cultural lostness and these things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.180" end="00:08:35.710" style="s2">happening simultaneously in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.570" end="00:08:38.260" style="s2">particular alchemy of of me and if I</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.740" end="00:08:52.570" style="s2">so so in a way that discovery process</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.640" end="00:08:54.670" style="s2">has been ongoing around finding finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.570" end="00:09:00.310" style="s2">a voice</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.670" end="00:09:05.710" style="s2">and part of that is recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:10.060" style="s2">that has to be a voice that has room to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.710" end="00:09:15.030" style="s2">learn in it it&#39;s not like a stick that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.060" end="00:09:16.330" style="s2">can just dial in turn on and turn off I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.030" end="00:09:18.520" style="s2">hear you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.330" end="00:09:23.530" style="s2">yeah I hate you I really do I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.520" end="00:09:33.450" style="s2">some through out your words there I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.530" end="00:09:33.450" style="s2">I felt like a resonating pulse because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.920" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">there&#39;s something about one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.920" end="00:09:49.000" style="s2">of the most radical ideas I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:52.150" style="s2">begin to articulate it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.000" end="00:09:54.310" style="s2">referencing is articulating this notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.150" end="00:10:00.850" style="s2">of what is it to be off-script</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.310" end="00:10:05.350" style="s2">mm-hmm but nevertheless from an</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.850" end="00:10:09.330" style="s2">intention of authentic betterment of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.350" end="00:10:11.860" style="s2">self and society self and context</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.330" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">you mentioned this notion of space</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.860" end="00:10:16.810" style="s2">between the words and the space in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:19.990" style="s2">therefore also before the words we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.810" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">drop in and in some important sense not</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.990" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">know what&#39;s going to come next but there</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:28.660" style="s2">does seem to be a mode of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:32.380" style="s2">that a mode of being that if you allow</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.660" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">yourself to drop into it is simply what</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.380" end="00:10:37.840" style="s2">it is and there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:41.110" style="s2">vulnerable about that and we&#39;ve spoken</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.840" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">just previously about this something to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.110" end="00:10:45.160" style="s2">do with this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:47.620" style="s2">vulnerability and exposure because in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.160" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s not clear what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.620" end="00:10:54.760" style="s2">to come up and I would suggest that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:56.470" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking from that space some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.760" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">the we could take you know the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.470" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">of the unconscious for instance as one</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:03.160" style="s2">level of analysis which is really like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:05.830" style="s2">cluster of different sorts of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.160" end="00:11:07.480" style="s2">which permeate our psyche and have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.830" end="00:11:09.550" style="s2">embedded history in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.480" end="00:11:11.079" style="s2">evolution and well what are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.550" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">say about that metaphysically well</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.079" end="00:11:14.589" style="s2">that&#39;s all of a sudden an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">conversation but we feel these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.589" end="00:11:19.180" style="s2">out and we aren&#39;t necessarily aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re being born along by but we</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.180" end="00:11:23.649" style="s2">know or at least we feel it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">in our moments of most aliveness that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.649" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">are deeply involved in whatever the flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:32.949" style="s2">and the turn of that meaning is yet it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:35.139" style="s2">can feel so much like we are a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.949" end="00:11:38.170" style="s2">little boat with very little orientation</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.139" end="00:11:39.970" style="s2">on these massive waves and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.170" end="00:11:42.579" style="s2">vulnerability and that what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.970" end="00:11:45.100" style="s2">come up and just what role am I playing</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.579" end="00:11:47.860" style="s2">here of the many and just what is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.100" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">context in which that role is drawing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.860" end="00:11:52.930" style="s2">itself out and the future itself is sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:56.130" style="s2">of unknown but sort of bravely we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.930" end="00:11:59.860" style="s2">looking to be in a way that we can what</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.130" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">feel in in in Integris relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.860" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">at the end of the day that that we that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:08.490" style="s2">we did what we could without holding</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.410" end="00:12:11.709" style="s2">something back which may have been a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.490" end="00:12:14.529" style="s2">which may have been like a little bead</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.709" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">of truth there that perhaps if it had</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.529" end="00:12:18.040" style="s2">been spoken may have oriented something</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:19.480" style="s2">a different way but all of a sudden then</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.040" end="00:12:20.949" style="s2">we&#39;re getting lost in that abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.480" end="00:12:23.620" style="s2">you can only speak what you can speak at</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.949" end="00:12:26.410" style="s2">the time and it gets so complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.620" end="00:12:28.630" style="s2">certainly there&#39;s this vulnerability to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.410" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">going off-script but at the same time a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.630" end="00:12:35.829" style="s2">congealing of these cultural forces that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:37.510" style="s2">seem to be willing that there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.829" end="00:12:41.709" style="s2">be it seemed willingness to happen it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.510" end="00:12:44.350" style="s2">seems as a necessity for us to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.709" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">together ways of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.350" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">which are not pre-prepared which are not</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">planned in advance you know Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:54.579" style="s2">might refer to this in that kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:56.740" style="s2">we might use a language of game a the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.579" end="00:12:59.139" style="s2">story of civilization so far a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.740" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">top-down imposition of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.139" end="00:13:04.180" style="s2">narrative in order to keep people more</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:07.569" style="s2">or less functioning in a predictable way</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:09.699" style="s2">together and let&#39;s not challenge that at</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.569" end="00:13:11.500" style="s2">all because all of a sudden whoa how are</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.699" end="00:13:13.449" style="s2">we feeling psychologically then in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.500" end="00:13:16.300" style="s2">in this strange world how do we step out</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.449" end="00:13:20.140" style="s2">and and and build something which might</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.300" end="00:13:21.170" style="s2">have somehow a love for itself and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.140" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.170" end="00:13:31.160" style="s2">or call them closer closer to the heart</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:35.589" style="s2">somehow anyway these ideas are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.160" end="00:13:42.980" style="s2">so I think for me this is really a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.589" end="00:13:45.940" style="s2">important piece because well because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.980" end="00:13:50.500" style="s2">coming into this from another angle and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.940" end="00:13:53.329" style="s2">that the the way that I was brought into</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.500" end="00:13:55.790" style="s2">this sort of body of work around</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.329" end="00:13:59.899" style="s2">complexity and systems thinking before I</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.790" end="00:14:02.870" style="s2">read all the books and did the academic</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.899" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">work it was actually just how I learned</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.870" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">to live life it was how the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:12.019" style="s2">conversations went at breakfast when I</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:16.550" style="s2">was a toddler okay so so when I first</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.019" end="00:14:19.070" style="s2">set out to make that film I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.550" end="00:14:20.899" style="s2">Bateson scholars in the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.070" end="00:14:23.000" style="s2">people who were working in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.899" end="00:14:25.310" style="s2">and systems thinking and all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.000" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">different you know sort of professions</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.310" end="00:14:32.899" style="s2">and parts of the world in which that has</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.620" end="00:14:34.839" style="s2">gravitas and said I wanted to make that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.899" end="00:14:38.510" style="s2">film and people said it can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.839" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">because these ideas can&#39;t be put into</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.510" end="00:14:46.010" style="s2">that form and the thing is is that I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:49.430" style="s2">coming to those ideas from a different</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.010" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">direction and that direction was one in</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.430" end="00:14:56.990" style="s2">which they were lived and I it took me a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">long time to really recognize that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.990" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">was something that I had to offer there</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:06.680" style="s2">are a lot of people who are able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:16.060" style="s2">deliver a particular kind of tone and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.680" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">and aesthetic of versions of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.060" end="00:15:23.540" style="s2">complexity and systems thinking and sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:26.600" style="s2">of you know from the formulas to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.540" end="00:15:30.819" style="s2">jargon to the various theoretical</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.560" end="00:15:42.090" style="s2">one of the things about that is that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.890" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not lived it&#39;s still over there</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.090" end="00:15:48.330" style="s2">somewhere it&#39;s it&#39;s something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:53.730" style="s2">talking about and what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.330" end="00:15:55.470" style="s2">interested in is that that within of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.730" end="00:15:58.950" style="s2">to when you&#39;re within that when it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.470" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">the the deep mode from which you respond</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.950" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">in the moment off script with your kid</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:09.030" style="s2">with your spouse at breakfast in traffic</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:11.990" style="s2">dealing with the tax guy like at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.030" end="00:16:15.420" style="s2">level what questions are you asking</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.990" end="00:16:17.370" style="s2">what&#39;s bubbling up so it&#39;s not like and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.420" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">since I&#39;m sitting in front of Tim I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.370" end="00:16:21.540" style="s2">gonna be the complexity girl and then as</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:26.130" style="s2">soon as I&#39;m off camera I&#39;m gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.540" end="00:16:30.900" style="s2">raving bitch right and that&#39;s my plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.130" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">yeah well you know it&#39;s been done and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.900" end="00:16:40.170" style="s2">I think that that for me that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:42.660" style="s2">important and when I was kind of finding</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.170" end="00:16:46.680" style="s2">that voice in in this world which</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.660" end="00:16:48.450" style="s2">incidentally didn&#39;t really exist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.680" end="00:16:51.780" style="s2">really like like you said it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.450" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">become a thing we have a community now</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.780" end="00:16:57.630" style="s2">there is an urgency there&#39;s at at you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:16:59.910" style="s2">know where were in we&#39;re surfing on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.630" end="00:17:07.400" style="s2">same wave now we&#39;re we&#39;re together you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.910" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">know but but back in you know oh nine</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.400" end="00:17:12.030" style="s2">when I wanted to make a film about</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:18.930" style="s2">complexity everyone was like what and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.030" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">the the documentary film companies just</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.930" end="00:17:23.010" style="s2">they just said there&#39;s no way we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:25.350" style="s2">sell this what is it is it personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.010" end="00:17:28.439" style="s2">story is that science is it philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.350" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">is it is it activism is it what is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.439" end="00:17:33.210" style="s2">and I was like yes it&#39;s all of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.550" style="s2">things and why should they be separate</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.210" end="00:17:38.070" style="s2">so if we&#39;re talking about how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.550" end="00:17:41.970" style="s2">gonna bring these things together the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.070" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">voice and the the deep impulses around</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.970" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">which this defragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.460" end="00:17:55.740" style="s2">becomes expression becomes lived that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.659" end="00:17:57.769" style="s2">key what does it look like to be in</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.740" end="00:18:01.370" style="s2">complexity and not be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.769" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">complexity but to be responding to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.370" end="00:18:09.720" style="s2">with you know like I said with my with</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">my kids with with the lady at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.720" end="00:18:19.470" style="s2">restaurant with the whoever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:21.779" style="s2">I&#39;m in conversation with so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.470" end="00:18:25.499" style="s2">I&#39;m really glad we kind of got off on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.779" end="00:18:29.190" style="s2">this pathway because sometimes I feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.499" end="00:18:32.940" style="s2">really underestimated and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.190" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">there&#39;s almost a kind of competition a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:42.389" style="s2">sort of sports trivia game night of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:45.629" style="s2">to kind of bat around the jargon and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.389" end="00:18:50.249" style="s2">know and I can sometimes be criticized</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.629" end="00:18:52.679" style="s2">for not doing that but what those people</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.249" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is that in the stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.679" end="00:18:58.679" style="s2">that I&#39;m telling all that theory is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:19:01.529" style="s2">there if you can see it when it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.679" end="00:19:04.980" style="s2">the prose of theory when it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.529" end="00:19:08.940" style="s2">poetry of story you will see it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.980" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">that recognition of seeing these these</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.940" end="00:19:16.169" style="s2">principles and these patterns in life</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:18.360" style="s2">and then living into them or living into</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.169" end="00:19:20.249" style="s2">them and then seeing them or some sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.360" end="00:19:22.679" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know where the beginning in</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.249" end="00:19:28.379" style="s2">the end of those two processes are but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.679" end="00:19:30.659" style="s2">but it&#39;s a big shift from the whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.379" end="00:19:34.460" style="s2">and the PowerPoint and the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.659" end="00:19:34.460" style="s2">competition and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">the forming of an identity that has</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.670" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">status in a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:53.310" style="s2">communities - look this is we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:19:57.860" style="s2">living life and when you live life and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.310" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">you you know you&#39;re looking at these</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.860" end="00:20:09.870" style="s2">principles even right down in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:12.330" style="s2">sexuality or your you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.870" end="00:20:14.340" style="s2">not really how you do the easy moments</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:14.990" style="s2">that counts it&#39;s how you do the hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.340" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.990" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2">how much complexity are you bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:28.230" style="s2">then yeah that&#39;s very very beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:33.170" style="s2">put something that&#39;s come to mind as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.230" end="00:20:38.840" style="s2">way perhaps we can orient this</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.170" end="00:20:43.530" style="s2">exploration is in virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.840" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">appearance of fear in experience in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.530" end="00:20:51.990" style="s2">bodies because I&#39;m interested in many</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.420" end="00:20:55.860" style="s2">things but I&#39;m interested in what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.990" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">the psychological mechanisms we can use</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.860" end="00:20:59.010" style="s2">psychology of course we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.890" style="s2">talking about more things what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.010" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">what are the stimulus-response</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.890" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">relationships what are the conditionings</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:17.580" style="s2">which preempt or or have a slip into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:19.140" style="s2">kind of well in the language of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.580" end="00:21:21.060" style="s2">documentary I watched last night it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.140" end="00:21:23.850" style="s2">emphasizing this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.060" end="00:21:26.760" style="s2">parts and then also relating to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.850" end="00:21:30.060" style="s2">whole so what is it that has us come to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.760" end="00:21:34.710" style="s2">divide the world up into parts again so</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.060" end="00:21:37.170" style="s2">that perhaps we can protect or keep some</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.710" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">of our identity a little bit more stable</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.170" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">so that we can be functioning in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:45.390" style="s2">space perhaps the competitive batting</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:48.260" style="s2">back-and-forth certain intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.390" end="00:21:50.760" style="s2">terms as they apply to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.260" end="00:21:52.509" style="s2">subculture that may be doing some very</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.760" end="00:21:54.849" style="s2">good theoretical work in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.509" end="00:21:56.259" style="s2">particular set of content in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.849" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">particular context which might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.259" end="00:22:01.419" style="s2">bridging many different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:02.769" style="s2">analysis but has somehow just removed</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.419" end="00:22:04.719" style="s2">itself a little bit from really</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.769" end="00:22:05.859" style="s2">including the observer in that just for</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.719" end="00:22:08.259" style="s2">the purpose let&#39;s say of a rational</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.859" end="00:22:09.459" style="s2">discussion where I&#39;m in this position</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.259" end="00:22:10.539" style="s2">and you&#39;re in that position but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.459" end="00:22:13.239" style="s2">like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.539" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">what am I predict is are we protecting</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.239" end="00:22:18.999" style="s2">something is like it seems to me fear is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:20.919" style="s2">involved it like it&#39;s playing an</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.999" end="00:22:23.199" style="s2">important role and we can break that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.919" end="00:22:25.959" style="s2">apart in so many ways I just wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.199" end="00:22:31.479" style="s2">your response might be to a question</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.959" end="00:22:34.209" style="s2">like to what degree does fear maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.479" end="00:22:36.879" style="s2">trauma but perhaps a kit anyway you like</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.209" end="00:22:39.729" style="s2">to what degree does fear make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.879" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">difficult for us to be in a more</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.729" end="00:22:48.579" style="s2">contextual relationship with being I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:53.859" style="s2">don&#39;t know in a word I guess the reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.579" end="00:22:56.619" style="s2">I I want to just put that in that frame</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.859" end="00:23:00.190" style="s2">of just I don&#39;t know it&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.619" end="00:23:04.529" style="s2">don&#39;t know where the edges are or if</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.190" end="00:23:08.169" style="s2">it&#39;s worthwhile to make edges between</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.529" end="00:23:10.239" style="s2">different emotional identified different</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:14.229" style="s2">emotional states that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.239" end="00:23:17.949" style="s2">and you know that we have a vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.229" end="00:23:22.019" style="s2">and a language and a culture that loves</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.949" end="00:23:24.849" style="s2">to divide things and and remembering</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.019" end="00:23:27.129" style="s2">that there are very different emotions</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.849" end="00:23:30.849" style="s2">possible to describe in other languages</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.129" end="00:23:36.039" style="s2">and also recognizing that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.849" end="00:23:40.179" style="s2">can you have fear without love without</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.039" end="00:23:42.190" style="s2">joy without hope without hopelessness I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.179" end="00:23:45.669" style="s2">mean how can you separate hope and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.190" end="00:23:50.169" style="s2">hopelessness so there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.669" end="00:23:52.619" style="s2">something about that sort of meme around</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.169" end="00:23:56.319" style="s2">fear that I kind of get allergic to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.619" end="00:23:59.109" style="s2">because it wants to create a binary that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.319" end="00:24:01.899" style="s2">there&#39;s some land without fear in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.109" end="00:24:05.870" style="s2">it would be more advisable to be having</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.899" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">your responses but you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.870" end="00:24:13.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t know about that my feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.500" end="00:24:17.450" style="s2">that that when I&#39;m afraid of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.040" end="00:24:19.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it&#39;s probably except</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.450" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">telling me something about what my</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.640" end="00:24:23.350" style="s2">relationship is to that context that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.090" end="00:25:03.080" style="s2">when we&#39;re dealing with this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.690" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">we call psychology because I don&#39;t I</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.090" style="s2">and the world of data is so screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.890" end="00:25:37.460" style="s2">and I thought oh my god we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.090" end="00:25:39.290" style="s2">bring these things together and this is</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.990" end="00:25:50.510" style="s2">there was sort of in the room this</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.720" end="00:25:54.620" style="s2">question of how are we knowing what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.510" end="00:25:59.030" style="s2">know about any of this and to have come</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.620" end="00:26:03.230" style="s2">this far down the decades of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.030" end="00:26:08.350" style="s2">and research and development of you know</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.070" end="00:26:29.180" style="s2">and recognizing right now that in order</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.580" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">to deal with mental health we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.180" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">to have to be talking about a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">than people&#39;s state of mind and and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">then you&#39;re back in context and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">trans contextual process said how do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:52.580" style="s2">I mean you can&#39;t separate family and</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">know all of these things come in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.700" end="00:27:23.900" style="s2">create these labyrinths of context and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:26.300" style="s2">then to think that we can somehow get</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.900" end="00:27:32.930" style="s2">those grapes out of the wine look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.300" end="00:27:37.430" style="s2">them and analyze I I think that we have</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.760" end="00:28:04.730" style="s2">words there has really been a feeding of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:08.470" style="s2">the ghost in our culture that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.730" end="00:28:11.390" style="s2">eat memes I would love to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.470" end="00:28:13.310" style="s2">extrapolate on that that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.390" end="00:28:15.530" style="s2">very interesting and it&#39;s driving me</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.310" end="00:28:16.070" style="s2">crazy actually it&#39;s just driving me</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.490" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">many places that I go working I work in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:27.950" style="s2">lots of different direction so working</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.640" end="00:29:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a river of memes out there and I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.460" end="00:29:12.620" style="s2">find it it&#39;s it&#39;s really difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.030" end="00:29:16.850" style="s2">get out of the memes and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.620" end="00:29:18.679" style="s2">punk rocker inside of me it&#39;s just you</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.620" end="00:29:33.290" style="s2">know gathering to gathering this just</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.290" end="00:29:35.330" style="s2">like this flood of things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.290" end="00:29:37.160" style="s2">said before and thinks you know once it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.330" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">starts to get traction it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.160" end="00:29:43.100" style="s2">Thing Thing and so in the car today on</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.940" style="s2">the way over here we started talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.100" end="00:29:49.210" style="s2">about collective intelligence and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.940" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">and I was just saying I you know I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.210" end="00:29:54.410" style="s2">just feel like we have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:57.140" style="s2">because already this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.410" end="00:30:01.160" style="s2">collective intelligence is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.140" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">Park it&#39;s starting to ossify it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.160" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">starting to become you know another one</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.530" style="s2">is sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">now these are both terminologies that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.530" end="00:30:11.570" style="s2">I&#39;m myself of use so I&#39;m not criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.590" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">the terminology or the people using it</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.570" end="00:30:19.270" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying heads up the context we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:22.540" style="s2">live in wants to jargon eyes things and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.270" end="00:30:24.740" style="s2">when we jargon eyes them we don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.540" end="00:30:27.140" style="s2">around the corner anymore</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.740" end="00:30:28.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not in that raw improvisational</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.140" end="00:30:36.770" style="s2">space you&#39;re not off script</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.730" end="00:30:38.780" style="s2">mm-hm and so that I don&#39;t know yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.770" end="00:30:41.179" style="s2">I think you get where I&#39;m coming I hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.780" end="00:30:43.670" style="s2">you I hear you we&#39;ve feels to me we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.179" end="00:30:48.970" style="s2">circling around</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.670" end="00:30:48.970" style="s2">this thing which is something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.300" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">actually what matters is being here now</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:31:01.910" style="s2">and showing up as we are and as we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:04.550" style="s2">for the second we begin to say for what</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:05.930" style="s2">all of a sudden then we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.550" end="00:31:09.140" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to look a bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.930" end="00:31:10.760" style="s2">referential with respect to the story we</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.140" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">take ourselves to be a part of and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.760" end="00:31:17.780" style="s2">perhaps a vision we might suggest is one</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:19.940" style="s2">worth moving towards so we are trapped</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.780" end="00:31:21.350" style="s2">here and I would suggest perhaps even on</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.940" end="00:31:23.930" style="s2">this point it might be something of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.350" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">double bind I was just gonna say damned</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.930" end="00:31:29.990" style="s2">if we do and damned if we don&#39;t we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">in a double bind and but what&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.990" end="00:31:35.780" style="s2">is the tension okay that creative</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:39.800" style="s2">tension in this double bind is filled</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.780" end="00:31:44.560" style="s2">with possibility so you know to to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.800" end="00:31:48.290" style="s2">that that frustration and let it show me</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.560" end="00:31:50.660" style="s2">what it is that I&#39;m wanting to express</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.290" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">that the that somehow the meme culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.660" end="00:31:56.930" style="s2">or the the scripted referential</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:32:01.060" style="s2">processes are shutting out that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.930" end="00:32:05.150" style="s2">that that&#39;s this moment of if I can look</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.060" end="00:32:07.280" style="s2">look work it&#39;s rigorous okay so this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.150" end="00:32:10.970" style="s2">about being there but even when we say</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.280" end="00:32:19.900" style="s2">show up it can sound kind of passive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.970" end="00:32:19.900" style="s2">it can sound kind of scripted yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.850" end="00:32:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy it&#39;s a really serious</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:34.309" style="s2">attention and it&#39;s an attention that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.880" end="00:32:36.889" style="s2">not just intellectual it&#39;s emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.309" end="00:32:40.580" style="s2">it&#39;s physical and it&#39;s cultural and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.889" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s nonverbal as much as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.580" end="00:32:49.190" style="s2">verbal and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:54.139" style="s2">calling for is to develop that attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.190" end="00:32:58.100" style="s2">to the kind of information that we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.139" end="00:33:04.279" style="s2">and we are within that I would call warm</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.100" end="00:33:08.659" style="s2">data that that is actually not on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.279" end="00:33:13.340" style="s2">page mm-hmm so what does it mean to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.659" end="00:33:16.250" style="s2">with that clay right to be in that to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.340" end="00:33:20.299" style="s2">transform yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.250" end="00:33:23.110" style="s2">times one and what it transforms is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:26.210" style="s2">the ideas mm-hmm but the space behind</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.110" end="00:33:32.149" style="s2">the ideas where the ideas are bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.210" end="00:33:34.669" style="s2">up from what is the the petri dish from</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.149" end="00:33:37.700" style="s2">which these ideas are bubbling what kind</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.700" end="00:33:45.049" style="s2">question of fear comes in again right</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.210" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">what&#39;s what is that that place from</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.049" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">which and it is scary you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:53.029" style="s2">I look at the world right now and I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:59.809" style="s2">a bunch of kids and I&#39;m scared for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.029" end="00:34:03.759" style="s2">mm-hmm and I don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.809" end="00:34:08.629" style="s2">think that that fear misson forms me</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.759" end="00:34:12.200" style="s2">because I also love this beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.629" end="00:34:17.869" style="s2">took a walk in the forest yesterday in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.200" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">New Zealand and it was just the vast</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.869" end="00:34:27.069" style="s2">beautiful interaction of all these</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:27.069" style="s2">living processes across time and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.409" end="00:34:36.940" style="s2">so hmm again it&#39;s coming back to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.569" end="00:34:39.129" style="s2">notion of isolation isolation of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.940" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">individual isolation of the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.129" end="00:34:48.839" style="s2">isolation of the idea isolation of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:52.809" style="s2">intention isolation of the even</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.809" end="00:35:04.530" style="s2">which I&#39;m speaking and trying to drop</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.210" end="00:35:09.400" style="s2">into that place with you here now where</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.530" end="00:35:13.990" style="s2">I&#39;m still seven years old I&#39;m in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.400" end="00:35:18.510" style="s2">you know I referenced the 80s and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.990" end="00:35:23.530" style="s2">punk rock version and I&#39;m still that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.510" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">that person who was pre kids who had all</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.530" end="00:35:33.670" style="s2">sorts of dreams and horizons and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:37.690" style="s2">I&#39;m also this person now and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.670" end="00:35:41.349" style="s2">that if I can be present with that if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.690" end="00:35:43.480" style="s2">can be with you which is really about</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.349" end="00:35:47.290" style="s2">being with me too right because I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.480" end="00:35:57.240" style="s2">to be okay with it but we are complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.290" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">mm-hmm and that is not just fodder for</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.240" end="00:36:04.450" style="s2">the groovy meme machine hmm yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">something that came up just towards the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.450" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.759" end="00:36:13.559" style="s2">that you are the punk-rocker you are the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:20.869" style="s2">mother you are the mother you are before</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.559" end="00:36:20.869" style="s2">you had children you are seven years old</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:29.640" style="s2">being here in the context of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.519" end="00:36:32.309" style="s2">if that is I mean I suggest perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.640" end="00:36:34.440" style="s2">the to the extent that that is presence</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.309" end="00:36:38.309" style="s2">and embodied out and it feels to me very</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.440" end="00:36:40.589" style="s2">much that&#39;s the case that is what that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.309" end="00:36:45.390" style="s2">is the potential that I can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.589" end="00:36:47.099" style="s2">and be inspired by I can switch on</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.390" end="00:36:50.730" style="s2">things in myself things in me are</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.099" end="00:36:53.999" style="s2">switched on when I witness or I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.730" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">presence of an elder or someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.999" end="00:36:59.759" style="s2">simply really a the way we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:02.430" style="s2">here presencing themselves in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.759" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">complexity without just getting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.430" end="00:37:05.670" style="s2">this perspective right now and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:07.019" style="s2">coming at me like I need to be that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.670" end="00:37:08.579" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like we&#39;ll hang on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.019" end="00:37:09.960" style="s2">something behind there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.579" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">behind the eyes there there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.960" end="00:37:14.460" style="s2">behind this I&#39;m not quite sure if this</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.529" style="s2">is this is happening now is it does it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.460" end="00:37:17.880" style="s2">apply to me moving away from here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.529" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">almost like there isn&#39;t there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.880" end="00:37:25.009" style="s2">something deep that it kind of enables</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:27.869" style="s2">what it does is it enables that which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.009" end="00:37:29.910" style="s2">perhaps less developed or wants to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.869" end="00:37:32.339" style="s2">its voice but might feel vulnerable does</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.910" end="00:37:34.410" style="s2">not feel as though it can presents</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.339" end="00:37:35.999" style="s2">itself it&#39;s like oh no there is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.410" end="00:37:40.140" style="s2">something strong here there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.999" end="00:37:43.499" style="s2">that is yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.140" end="00:37:45.509" style="s2">it&#39;s fertile it&#39;s there&#39;s potential</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.499" end="00:37:48.329" style="s2">there that&#39;s nourishing somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.509" end="00:37:53.880" style="s2">something that I&#39;m very interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.329" end="00:37:56.489" style="s2">is present seeing that which is of its</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.880" end="00:37:57.930" style="s2">of values of people but quite like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.489" end="00:37:59.700" style="s2">quite like to be a good person that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.930" end="00:38:02.940" style="s2">seems like a reasonable goal right what</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.700" end="00:38:05.519" style="s2">does that mean it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.940" end="00:38:10.049" style="s2">we&#39;re in developmental relationships</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.519" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">with the world and each other and we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.049" end="00:38:16.799" style="s2">all winding our paths and we are all in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:20.779" style="s2">some sort of continuity with each other</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.799" end="00:38:20.779" style="s2">and we are all in different places</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.080" end="00:38:26.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t change anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.250" end="00:38:28.620" style="s2">you can&#39;t wrestle someone along although</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.280" end="00:38:30.210" style="s2">you can wrestle someone along but not</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.620" end="00:38:31.890" style="s2">all of them come in with you and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.210" end="00:38:34.890" style="s2">might be having to silence part of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.890" end="00:38:36.660" style="s2">that really wanted to just dance their</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.890" end="00:38:38.340" style="s2">way there and perhaps go in a different</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.660" end="00:38:39.930" style="s2">direction but now you&#39;re yanking them</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.340" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">and so they&#39;re having to switch off part</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.930" end="00:38:43.530" style="s2">of themselves and been sort of forced</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:46.620" style="s2">along in that direction it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.530" end="00:38:49.230" style="s2">not appropriate it&#39;s that top-down not</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.620" end="00:38:52.020" style="s2">really being open in some important</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.230" end="00:38:54.830" style="s2">sense to the developmental capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.020" end="00:38:57.990" style="s2">needs maybe of those around you and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.830" end="00:39:02.460" style="s2">it seems like we can maybe do something</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.990" end="00:39:05.640" style="s2">like hold out a hand and perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.460" end="00:39:07.260" style="s2">taken perhaps it isn&#39;t perhaps someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.640" end="00:39:09.720" style="s2">feels an intimation that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.260" end="00:39:11.640" style="s2">something loving there somewhere they</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.720" end="00:39:13.830" style="s2">might part of them might feel as though</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.640" end="00:39:15.140" style="s2">they might want to be certainly might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.830" end="00:39:17.460" style="s2">where they might want to be and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.140" end="00:39:18.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just like that little light it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.460" end="00:39:20.730" style="s2">like something on the horizon just</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.900" end="00:39:22.620" style="s2">shimmers for a second and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.730" end="00:39:24.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a mom there&#39;s a space to move</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.620" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">into somehow there&#39;s a space over there</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.870" end="00:39:28.410" style="s2">to move into and it may be it goes you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:29.880" style="s2">know maybe that falls away from</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.410" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">attention again but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.880" end="00:39:34.340" style="s2">that&#39;s been opened up about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.220" end="00:39:37.800" style="s2">complexity that we can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.340" end="00:39:41.130" style="s2">then feels like oh there&#39;s maybe a table</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.800" end="00:39:45.830" style="s2">there for me one day to sit at and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.130" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">think that I&#39;m remembering this moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.830" end="00:39:57.150" style="s2">where when my ex-husband and I were in</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:58.860" style="s2">the process of separating and we went to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.150" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">a counselor because everyone said we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.860" end="00:40:06.930" style="s2">to go to a counselor and this counselor</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:09.870" style="s2">it was me that was leaving and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.930" end="00:40:12.360" style="s2">counselor but we both needed to you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.870" end="00:40:15.420" style="s2">we had 20 great years together but it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.360" end="00:40:22.650" style="s2">was it was time and this counselor said</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.420" end="00:40:27.060" style="s2">to me why are you leaving and for a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.650" end="00:40:29.150" style="s2">split second I started running down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.060" end="00:40:33.859" style="s2">possibilities of why I was leaving I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:37.709" style="s2">started to go inward and to form</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.859" end="00:40:40.589" style="s2">ideas and language and rationalities and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.709" end="00:40:45.809" style="s2">justifications around why I was leaving</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.589" end="00:40:50.179" style="s2">and then I recognized that if I did that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.809" end="00:40:52.979" style="s2">I was actually going to concretize a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.179" end="00:40:55.979" style="s2">story that I would then have to live</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.979" end="00:40:59.189" style="s2">with him and that if you asked me in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.979" end="00:41:01.969" style="s2">five years or two months I will have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.189" end="00:41:05.579" style="s2">very different understanding of this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.969" end="00:41:08.339" style="s2">so what&#39;s what&#39;s important about this in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.579" end="00:41:13.229" style="s2">terms of our conversation is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.339" end="00:41:16.529" style="s2">recognition of I could not bring my</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.229" end="00:41:19.529" style="s2">complexity to that question she asked me</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.529" end="00:41:24.719" style="s2">a question that was an invitation to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.529" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">reductionism and it was so culturally</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.719" end="00:41:33.329" style="s2">justified that I almost fell in the well</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:36.269" style="s2">okay but at the last second I said I</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.329" end="00:41:41.029" style="s2">refuse to answer that question because</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.269" end="00:41:44.189" style="s2">we need to have those those</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.029" end="00:41:48.269" style="s2">understandings that will occur have room</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.189" end="00:41:53.549" style="s2">to occur okay so this is what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.269" end="00:41:57.059" style="s2">getting at about how how it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.549" end="00:42:00.869" style="s2">complexity right that&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.059" end="00:42:04.499" style="s2">that moment of recognizing I can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.869" end="00:42:06.989" style="s2">complexity in this question and how many</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.499" end="00:42:10.919" style="s2">questions how many surveys how many</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.989" end="00:42:12.809" style="s2">discourses how many laying outs of four</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.919" end="00:42:14.519" style="s2">different aspects of the five different</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.950" end="00:43:33.270" style="s2">of the conversation and and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:42.690" style="s2">where for me there&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.990" end="00:44:13.290" style="s2">comfortable like good hiking boots that</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.290" end="00:44:23.580" style="s2">right and that&#39;s really different than</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.380" end="00:44:26.910" style="s2">us being in competition or generating</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.000" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">so you know in this process of thinking</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:58.619" style="s2">part of it is I&#39;m just listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.980" end="00:44:58.619" style="s2">baby cry in the background mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.260" end="00:45:13.510" style="s2">the expression of love and frustration</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.070" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">and plaintive Ness and disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.510" end="00:45:23.890" style="s2">and eagerness and exhaustion right I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:32.859" style="s2">mean that&#39;s where we are and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.890" end="00:45:36.790" style="s2">it&#39;s complex mm-hmm we&#39;ve all cried a</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.859" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">lot maybe some people don&#39;t cry as much</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.790" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">when they get older perhaps to their</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">detriment I don&#39;t know I certainly feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:48.010" style="s2">there&#39;s some times where it tears come</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:53.800" style="s2">to me and they pass before they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.010" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">their time and sometimes they don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.800" end="00:45:58.780" style="s2">to be that baby crying and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.220" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">particular one then I&#39;m not sure if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.780" end="00:46:02.200" style="s2">mics were going to pick it up but that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.510" end="00:46:05.260" style="s2">baby&#39;s just warming up</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.200" end="00:46:06.369" style="s2">yeah that baby can detect that those</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.260" end="00:46:09.640" style="s2">needs can be taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.369" end="00:46:12.910" style="s2">let&#39;s hope they are there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.640" end="00:46:17.230" style="s2">which we have all been that so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.910" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">have all been needing love from a space</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.230" end="00:46:23.619" style="s2">of whoa I have no articulate capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">name what it is that&#39;s characterizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.619" end="00:46:28.150" style="s2">this state of it like an it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.710" style="s2">negative effect ation and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.150" end="00:46:31.660" style="s2">sudden everything&#39;s up for grabs my very</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.710" end="00:46:33.550" style="s2">life before I&#39;m aware I&#39;m a separate</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.660" end="00:46:35.410" style="s2">thing it&#39;s just being itself it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.550" end="00:46:37.089" style="s2">wow something&#39;s wrong something&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.410" end="00:46:39.070" style="s2">here and it&#39;s like who are we us we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.089" end="00:46:42.190" style="s2">terrified of that space there&#39;s a chaos</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.070" end="00:46:43.810" style="s2">in that space and and and it&#39;s it seems</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.190" end="00:46:45.550" style="s2">to me that rather than it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.810" end="00:46:47.410" style="s2">what do you do in that space although we</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.550" end="00:46:50.200" style="s2">can name certain things about it we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.410" end="00:46:52.180" style="s2">might say accept it or we might say</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.200" end="00:46:57.220" style="s2">various different things but but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.180" end="00:47:00.840" style="s2">seems to me that the cultivation of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.220" end="00:47:07.300" style="s2">community of relationships with people</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.840" end="00:47:09.550" style="s2">who have who know and have been to those</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.300" end="00:47:13.450" style="s2">depths have been to those places and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.550" end="00:47:16.630" style="s2">realized that there is love there</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.450" end="00:47:20.410" style="s2">actually that there is a way from there</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.630" end="00:47:22.420" style="s2">that that that that that that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.410" end="00:47:23.860" style="s2">negative effect of not knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.420" end="00:47:25.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive effect of not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.860" end="00:47:27.310" style="s2">too but as soon as we step into</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.090" end="00:47:28.840" style="s2">potential complex do all of a sudden we</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.310" end="00:47:30.700" style="s2">are unsettled and it&#39;s going to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.840" end="00:47:32.170" style="s2">various parts of ourselves that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.700" end="00:47:33.490" style="s2">have quite like to be fixed at that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.170" end="00:47:35.860" style="s2">moment you know if they were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.490" end="00:47:37.510" style="s2">comfortable and secure and and of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.860" end="00:47:39.340" style="s2">we like to have walls around us at night</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.510" end="00:47:42.580" style="s2">so things don&#39;t come and eat us and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.340" end="00:47:44.560" style="s2">it&#39;s again needing to fix the world just</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.580" end="00:47:47.800" style="s2">for certain times perhaps to attend to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.560" end="00:47:50.440" style="s2">other aspects of ourselves you know but</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.800" end="00:47:53.860" style="s2">but we get back into that double bind</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.440" end="00:47:56.710" style="s2">territory where I&#39;m feeling this link</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.860" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">just to reference this notion of elders</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.710" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">or this kind of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s that that presence of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.170" end="00:48:07.180" style="s2">love is stronger love is there actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.310" style="s2">at the bottom and that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.180" end="00:48:12.040" style="s2">know exactly how but that in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.310" end="00:48:14.860" style="s2">shaping up that mode of orientation that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.040" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">breath return to just a being with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.860" end="00:48:18.700" style="s2">and to it&#39;s in some sense to use a word</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.900" end="00:48:20.920" style="s2">sovereignty and of course that is a meme</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.700" end="00:48:22.690" style="s2">that is a very helpful one I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.920" end="00:48:25.930" style="s2">suggest at this current time although we</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.690" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">might say if that gets crystallized into</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.930" end="00:48:28.840" style="s2">something too tight and someone feels</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:30.550" style="s2">like hang on a second</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.840" end="00:48:32.080" style="s2">how these people are being sovereign and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.550" end="00:48:34.450" style="s2">the practices they&#39;re doing seem somehow</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.080" end="00:48:35.860" style="s2">to be missing out something authentic in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.450" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">me here that needs to come along and now</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.860" end="00:48:39.880" style="s2">I&#39;m stuck between sovereignty this and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:42.670" style="s2">now am I what is that does that get to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:48.190" style="s2">come along too it&#39;s like whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.670" end="00:48:50.920" style="s2">referencing there this capacity to know</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.910" end="00:49:06.280" style="s2">this in this context that&#39;s what feels</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.690" end="00:49:07.990" style="s2">appropriate for me to say this something</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.280" end="00:49:10.930" style="s2">there there&#39;s a glint behind that</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.670" end="00:49:39.970" style="s2">that there is a presence that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.340" end="00:50:38.110" style="s2">need people and I&#39;m so excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:40.210" style="s2">but that&#39;s another story but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.110" end="00:50:43.090" style="s2">things that I&#39;m really noticing in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.210" end="00:50:52.270" style="s2">process that I think ties into what</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.090" end="00:50:55.740" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that this this</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.270" end="00:51:01.750" style="s2">conversation turns out to be about voice</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.740" end="00:51:06.580" style="s2">about what it is to give voice and to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.750" end="00:51:11.350" style="s2">have voice to share voice and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.580" end="00:51:13.630" style="s2">community question it&#39;s it&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.350" end="00:51:18.190" style="s2">process of being an individual within a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.630" end="00:51:21.550" style="s2">community but it&#39;s only possible to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.190" end="00:51:24.370" style="s2">in community within a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.550" end="00:51:27.790" style="s2">possibilities that are be a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.370" end="00:51:30.280" style="s2">right and they&#39;re in the community all</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.790" end="00:51:33.220" style="s2">right so one thing that I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.280" end="00:51:35.350" style="s2">with this work that I&#39;m doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.220" end="00:51:38.520" style="s2">is that there are all these communities</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.350" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">that are so deeply fragmented and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.520" end="00:51:44.470" style="s2">they&#39;re in they need all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:47.590" style="s2">I mean all those that list of everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.470" end="00:51:50.860" style="s2">from you know whatever it is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.590" end="00:51:56.350" style="s2">environmental work to mental health care</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.860" end="00:51:58.120" style="s2">to education to dealing with housing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.350" end="00:51:59.830" style="s2">you were you know saying we just need a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.120" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">roof over our head and we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.830" end="00:52:07.000" style="s2">loved and okay essentially all of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:10.270" style="s2">things as it stands right now are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.000" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">handled by different institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.270" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">organizations so the experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">in community is often a process of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:25.150" style="s2">having you know the the health person</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:27.730" style="s2">come in and offer their advice of how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.150" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">improve health systems in your community</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.730" end="00:52:31.990" style="s2">the education experts come in and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:34.090" style="s2">talk about how they&#39;re going to develop</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.990" end="00:52:36.970" style="s2">curriculum and you know build better</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.090" end="00:52:39.130" style="s2">facilities and blah blah blah and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.970" end="00:52:41.530" style="s2">housing Commission&#39;s come in and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.130" end="00:52:43.410" style="s2">start to develop housing for people that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.530" end="00:52:45.820" style="s2">need housing or work with you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.410" end="00:52:47.260" style="s2">runaway rents or whatever that thing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.820" end="00:52:49.420" style="s2">they&#39;re the experts they deal with</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.260" end="00:52:54.100" style="s2">housing the employment people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.420" end="00:53:02.440" style="s2">dealing with employment etc doctors</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.100" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">psychologists and when dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.440" end="00:53:06.700" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;re noticing</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">with this people need people project is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.700" end="00:53:11.320" style="s2">that if first of all nobody ever asked</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">the community what they want okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:19.870" style="s2">just gonna let that sit for a second and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:25.560" style="s2">feel the meme just feel the meme because</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.870" end="00:53:30.550" style="s2">right there is one of those things and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.560" end="00:53:35.010" style="s2">what happens is this ask the community</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.550" end="00:53:39.340" style="s2">what they want and they have absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.010" end="00:53:45.790" style="s2">no other possibility than to respond</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.340" end="00:53:48.900" style="s2">based on what&#39;s on the menu okay and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.790" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">we&#39;re back in the same epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.900" end="00:53:54.220" style="s2">double-blind trap of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:58.260" style="s2">they can ask for being already</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.220" end="00:54:01.090" style="s2">compartmentalized fragmented and siloed</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.260" end="00:54:04.330" style="s2">you see so this is what I mean about</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.090" end="00:54:08.190" style="s2">what kind of voice what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.330" end="00:54:11.380" style="s2">communication is given to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.190" end="00:54:13.720" style="s2">different kind of response where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.380" end="00:54:16.150" style="s2">an invitation to go beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:18.040" style="s2">expectation of what&#39;s on the menu I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.150" end="00:54:23.410" style="s2">if you sit down in a restaurant and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.040" end="00:54:25.540" style="s2">say what do you want to eat you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.410" end="00:54:28.510" style="s2">I mean you&#39;re gonna look around and</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:31.390" style="s2">think what do they have here right</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.510" end="00:54:34.450" style="s2">what&#39;s on the menu if you&#39;re in a you</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.390" end="00:54:37.060" style="s2">know a noodle shop in</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.450" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">on the beach in Vietnam you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.060" end="00:54:42.609" style="s2">not gonna say hamburger because you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:46.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not on the menu right so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.609" end="00:54:50.010" style="s2">important sort of way of looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.030" end="00:54:53.140" style="s2">we are with each other and and how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.010" end="00:54:57.579" style="s2">generosity we can afford</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.140" end="00:55:00.910" style="s2">mm-hmm toward getting to a new dimension</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.579" end="00:55:04.780" style="s2">of questions and communication hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.910" end="00:55:07.630" style="s2">because right now it feels like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.780" end="00:55:11.380" style="s2">we just keep driving ourselves back down</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.630" end="00:55:13.060" style="s2">the same holes because the patterns mmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.380" end="00:55:16.510" style="s2">drive us there hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.060" end="00:55:19.690" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s that that question of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.510" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">what do you want and you know in the in</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.690" end="00:55:24.910" style="s2">the notion right now of what is your</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:31.540" style="s2">vision for a new future what is game B</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.910" end="00:55:34.630" style="s2">and and part of the the beauty of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.540" end="00:55:43.510" style="s2">question is the tension around what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.630" end="00:55:46.780" style="s2">the menu what could game B be and how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.510" end="00:55:53.560" style="s2">we begin to think about that in ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.780" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">that are loose from the existing</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.560" end="00:56:04.359" style="s2">structures yes it&#39;s not trivial this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:07.300" style="s2">not a trivial matter no no because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.359" end="00:56:10.630" style="s2">about where the expression and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.300" end="00:56:13.030" style="s2">imagination can even be developed and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.630" end="00:56:18.310" style="s2">you know what it isn&#39;t mine and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.030" end="00:56:21.310" style="s2">yours it&#39;s shared its contextual so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.310" end="00:56:23.319" style="s2">what&#39;s on the menu question is really a</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.310" end="00:56:30.010" style="s2">contextual question what can this</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.319" end="00:56:31.900" style="s2">context do yes and that isn&#39;t about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.010" end="00:56:34.089" style="s2">particular silos it&#39;s not about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.900" end="00:56:40.589" style="s2">particular departments it&#39;s and and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.089" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">that the the need to defragment as</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.589" end="00:56:48.010" style="s2">individuals to bring that personal voice</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:51.250" style="s2">into the professional</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.010" end="00:56:56.830" style="s2">realm to bring that that seven-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.250" end="00:57:00.940" style="s2">here with the you know mom of six to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.830" end="00:57:02.650" style="s2">this conversation about complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.940" end="00:57:06.580" style="s2">the future of the world that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.650" end="00:57:11.730" style="s2">and the extreme urgency mmm-hmm to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.580" end="00:57:15.970" style="s2">to another we have got to get to another</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.730" end="00:57:19.570" style="s2">you know get a little peek hole out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.970" end="00:57:25.560" style="s2">the epistemology frames that were in so</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.570" end="00:57:31.840" style="s2">that we can even see another possibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.560" end="00:57:35.110" style="s2">what we do is you know yeah mmm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.840" end="00:57:38.860" style="s2">so the love in that is about loving that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.110" end="00:57:44.100" style="s2">rigor because it&#39;s rigorous that is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.860" end="00:57:50.070" style="s2">a relaxed love that is a rigorous hyper</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.100" end="00:57:53.610" style="s2">attentive very tender super alert love</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.070" end="00:57:56.680" style="s2">to catch yourself okay I will not</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.610" end="00:57:59.980" style="s2">because I love this person or this</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.680" end="00:58:02.260" style="s2">community or this world I will not ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.980" end="00:58:05.020" style="s2">those questions that drive it back down</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.260" end="00:58:08.110" style="s2">in the same rabbit holes or just I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.020" end="00:58:09.100" style="s2">try not to write I mean I might not get</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.110" end="00:58:11.170" style="s2">it right right</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.100" end="00:58:16.030" style="s2">odds are pretty good that I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.170" end="00:58:20.920" style="s2">get better but even the the tonality and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.030" end="00:58:24.370" style="s2">the humility of trying is big yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.920" end="00:58:27.670" style="s2">think it can be so difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.370" end="00:58:32.560" style="s2">articulate questions that take into</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.670" end="00:58:34.630" style="s2">context this extreme complexity and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.560" end="00:58:38.850" style="s2">to do that in such a way that reference</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.630" end="00:58:42.610" style="s2">is also the double bind of really</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.850" end="00:58:43.780" style="s2">necessity because the thing is we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.610" end="00:58:46.810" style="s2">look here at what we&#39;re doing we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.780" end="00:58:49.720" style="s2">cameras we have microphones and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.810" end="00:58:52.950" style="s2">a sense in which we are being here</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.720" end="00:58:57.300" style="s2">together and we can explore as we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.950" end="00:58:59.570" style="s2">yet this particular moment did have</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.300" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">despite my</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.570" end="00:59:05.060" style="s2">in tension a certain artificial</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:06.980" style="s2">beginning to it which was I picked up</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.060" end="00:59:10.430" style="s2">the microphone and I began to pose</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.980" end="00:59:12.140" style="s2">something and I&#39;m conscious that well I</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.430" end="00:59:13.820" style="s2">I&#39;m actually less conscious than most</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.140" end="00:59:17.410" style="s2">people of what&#39;s engaging to watch right</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.820" end="00:59:20.780" style="s2">I died I put this first nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.410" end="00:59:22.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which I am in</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.780" end="00:59:25.460" style="s2">beginning by posing a question to you I</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.940" end="00:59:30.500" style="s2">have already cut the world in some way</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.460" end="00:59:34.220" style="s2">ya have and and so it seems to me in</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.500" end="00:59:37.820" style="s2">fact necessary to break the world up but</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.220" end="00:59:40.430" style="s2">in so doing to take to allow through</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.820" end="00:59:42.770" style="s2">that the part of ourselves that is not</p>

<p begin="00:59:50.060" end="00:59:55.550" style="s2">process and not identifying crucially</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.730" end="00:59:57.860" style="s2">with one particular part of it it seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.550" end="00:59:59.570" style="s2">like there&#39;s a dance we&#39;re doing at</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.860" end="01:00:03.860" style="s2">least developmentally I can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.570" end="01:00:06.800" style="s2">dance and perhaps if I am good then it</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.860" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">looks like one cohesive flow but you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.800" end="01:00:10.580" style="s2">know as I know from experience sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:12.110" style="s2">I might lose a bit of balance and all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.580" end="01:00:13.880" style="s2">a sudden there&#39;s a disjuncture there</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.110" end="01:00:15.950" style="s2">that if I&#39;m in front of other people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.880" end="01:00:17.840" style="s2">going to experience as a I might say Oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.950" end="01:00:20.390" style="s2">someone&#39;s seen that or it might be like</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.840" end="01:00:23.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite with it and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.390" end="01:00:26.330" style="s2">because well it&#39;s just how much of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.450" end="01:00:27.290" style="s2">what within is not as ready for the flow</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.330" end="01:00:33.320" style="s2">as it could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.290" end="01:00:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s and so it&#39;s so much forgiveness for</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.320" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">ourselves for ourselves you know charity</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.600" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">for ourselves and that&#39;s of course what</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:42.220" style="s2">you&#39;re you were referencing there at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">end it&#39;s it&#39;s not clear to me though</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.220" end="01:00:48.830" style="s2">given the context of our world as one</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:51.650" style="s2">that expresses itself so much through a</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.830" end="01:00:53.750" style="s2">fracturing or at least the combination</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.650" end="01:00:57.560" style="s2">of its expression and our perception is</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.750" end="01:01:00.500" style="s2">one that has a dis fracturing feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.560" end="01:01:02.120" style="s2">there it&#39;s like that&#39;s maybe maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.500" end="01:01:04.460" style="s2">can swim in the ocean but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.120" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">wreckage where within and swim whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.460" end="01:01:08.060" style="s2">way we like we&#39;re going to be hit in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.020" end="01:01:11.020" style="s2">face by some sort of board right so we</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.060" end="01:01:13.430" style="s2">sort of have to enable that and the a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.020" end="01:01:17.630" style="s2">world in which there is simply</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.430" end="01:01:20.300" style="s2">some flowing harmonic just solace to my</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.630" end="01:01:25.790" style="s2">being in the world conducive with this</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.300" end="01:01:29.660" style="s2">whole making - we cannot almost by</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.790" end="01:01:34.910" style="s2">definition name that state and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.660" end="01:01:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like I think about these things as</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.910" end="01:01:39.619" style="s2">deeply as I can and already using the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.460" end="01:01:41.809" style="s2">word think from a particular perspective</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.619" end="01:01:43.309" style="s2">is already cutting the world because we</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.809" end="01:01:44.809" style="s2">know that&#39;s referencing a certain type</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.309" end="01:01:47.450" style="s2">of cognition that might not be so</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.809" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">feeling toned in the moment and embodied</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.450" end="01:01:52.069" style="s2">but everywhere I turn in my attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.790" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">stay with you and be smooth and be</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.069" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">honest it&#39;s like I&#39;m peppered with what</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:58.190" style="s2">comes forth that has a lineage of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:02:01.790" style="s2">which is not as open to complexity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.190" end="01:02:04.670" style="s2">so I wonder how deep that goes when I am</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.790" end="01:02:06.950" style="s2">thinking about this is it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.670" end="01:02:08.359" style="s2">there so my dissertation and of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.950" end="01:02:09.710" style="s2">we don&#39;t know each other my dissertation</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.359" end="01:02:11.210" style="s2">that I wrote about three years ago was</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.710" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">called part making hole making and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.210" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">process and I was not familiar with so</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:20.329" style="s2">many wonderful thinkers I had not heard</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">of you I I wish I had and in so many</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.329" end="01:02:24.740" style="s2">ways I mean work I&#39;ve encountered after</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:26.390" style="s2">writing that is like oh well look all</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.740" end="01:02:28.339" style="s2">these amazing people saying what I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.390" end="01:02:30.470" style="s2">beginning to bite my teeth into with so</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.339" end="01:02:35.119" style="s2">much more articulate you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.470" end="01:02:38.390" style="s2">depth to them the metaphor at the time</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.119" end="01:02:43.369" style="s2">that I found closest to express what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.390" end="01:02:45.770" style="s2">saw as an image I&#39;m interested in what</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.369" end="01:02:47.059" style="s2">you feel about that I&#39;m not proposing it</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.770" end="01:02:49.010" style="s2">as anything other than something that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.059" end="01:02:51.980" style="s2">might be helpful might be not but it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.010" end="01:02:54.290" style="s2">this idea of a water wheel a certain</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.980" end="01:02:56.059" style="s2">kind of water wheel and I haven&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.290" end="01:02:57.619" style="s2">spoken about this in what feels like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.059" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">year and a year and a half now it sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.619" end="01:03:00.490" style="s2">of falling away and I&#39;ve been following</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.960" style="s2">other terms</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.490" end="01:03:05.089" style="s2">but there&#39;s so you can imagine the wheel</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.960" end="01:03:07.099" style="s2">it&#39;s being borne along by the water in</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.089" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">the stream pushing through it and these</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.099" end="01:03:12.829" style="s2">kind of tasks or kegs that are being</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:15.470" style="s2">pushed by the water sort of pick it up</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.829" end="01:03:17.059" style="s2">as they are submerged and then they lift</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.470" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">up and they&#39;re lifting the water and as</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.059" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">they come out and are you know emerged a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:24.380" style="s2">hot in their own holes but other sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:25.910" style="s2">parts call that kind of part making and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.380" end="01:03:27.140" style="s2">the whole making occurring when the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.910" end="01:03:28.910" style="s2">streams pushing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.140" end="01:03:30.830" style="s2">and then the whole process itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.910" end="01:03:32.810" style="s2">requires both parts or the balance of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.830" end="01:03:35.810" style="s2">the water will won&#39;t hold it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.810" end="01:03:37.700" style="s2">moving properly and so we have the whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.810" end="01:03:39.170" style="s2">making here we have the part making and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.700" end="01:03:41.390" style="s2">then we have the whole process which</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.170" end="01:03:42.830" style="s2">characterises both of them together and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.390" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">without one there cannot be the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.830" end="01:03:47.420" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely a relationship and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:49.550" style="s2">are all of that thing happening all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.420" end="01:03:51.350" style="s2">time and it&#39;s just stacks of water</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.550" end="01:03:56.510" style="s2">wheels on top of one another as far as</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.350" end="01:03:58.730" style="s2">this metaphor goes and so how it and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.510" end="01:04:00.380" style="s2">whether we are being one more than</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.730" end="01:04:02.090" style="s2">another part making your whole making is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.380" end="01:04:04.580" style="s2">to do with this how we pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.090" end="01:04:06.740" style="s2">it&#39;s where our attention goes and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.580" end="01:04:08.480" style="s2">we can speak about meditation and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.740" end="01:04:10.040" style="s2">contemplation and various mystical</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.480" end="01:04:11.870" style="s2">States and perhaps psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.040" end="01:04:15.710" style="s2">various things that enable a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.370" end="01:04:42.050" style="s2">coming back then into our own kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.860" end="01:04:43.790" style="s2">singularity for what we can talk about</p>

<p begin="01:04:47.450" end="01:04:53.240" style="s2">creativity and being more on the pulse</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.960" end="01:06:14.350" style="s2">that is part of your way of sense making</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.510" end="01:06:19.040" style="s2">and those are specifically your</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.350" end="01:06:22.130" style="s2">receptors okay and so in that sense you</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.040" end="01:06:24.680" style="s2">have agency you are you mm-hmm but if</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.130" end="01:06:26.510" style="s2">you ask that question again and you say</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.680" end="01:06:29.840" style="s2">where did those things come from well</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.510" end="01:06:32.420" style="s2">they all came from context so in a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.840" end="01:06:36.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not you nothing of you is yours</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.420" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">it all came from your contacts so this</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.320" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">is an interesting paradox and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:44.030" style="s2">it&#39;s I think a wonderfully productive</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:45.800" style="s2">paradox as long as you keep the tension</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.030" end="01:06:49.240" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.800" end="01:06:52.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s what&#39;s not productive is to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.240" end="01:06:54.620" style="s2">claim that agency and Trump around like</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.430" end="01:06:56.150" style="s2">you can change everything and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.620" end="01:06:58.130" style="s2">up to you and it&#39;s your fault and it</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.150" end="01:07:00.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and so on and so forth or</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.130" end="01:07:04.850" style="s2">to you know the flip side of that is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.650" end="01:07:07.160" style="s2">abandon all notions of it whatsoever or</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.850" end="01:07:08.840" style="s2">agency is a fallacy I&#39;m just my context</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.160" end="01:07:10.190" style="s2">and society made me do it man and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.840" end="01:07:11.720" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing we can do and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.190" end="01:07:13.040" style="s2">is just flowing along and I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.720" end="01:07:16.700" style="s2">bubble in the ocean and I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.040" end="01:07:20.780" style="s2">blow with it but there is some tension</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.700" end="01:07:23.030" style="s2">between those and I love the the Harare</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.780" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">was talking about free will in his</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.030" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">latest book and and that you you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:29.620" style="s2">you if you think you have free will you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:32.330" style="s2">really don&#39;t have any free will</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.620" end="01:07:34.190" style="s2">you&#39;re really delusional but basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.330" end="01:07:36.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve been you know we are</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.190" end="01:07:41.440" style="s2">contextualized what&#39;s on the menu is</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.290" end="01:07:44.180" style="s2">sort of the the the the neurocognitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.440" end="01:07:46.460" style="s2">response to every moment we&#39;re in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.180" end="01:07:51.940" style="s2">on the menu of response for this and</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.460" end="01:07:54.380" style="s2">where do those menu items come from and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.940" end="01:07:55.660" style="s2">so if you think you have your free will</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.380" end="01:07:58.730" style="s2">your kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.660" end="01:08:00.680" style="s2">under an illusion and it&#39;s an illusion</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.730" end="01:08:02.600" style="s2">that particularly has no free but the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.680" end="01:08:06.020" style="s2">minute you realize you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.600" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">free will paradoxically you get a little</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.020" end="01:08:15.500" style="s2">mm-hmm and and so that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:17.779" style="s2">interesting sort of part of this and my</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.500" end="01:08:19.910" style="s2">daughter a couple months ago I called</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.779" end="01:08:22.790" style="s2">her up she&#39;s 23 and she&#39;s in San</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.910" end="01:08:25.250" style="s2">Francisco and and I said how you dealing</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.790" end="01:08:28.580" style="s2">honey and she said Oh mom I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.250" end="01:08:30.259" style="s2">shitty and I said why and she said well</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.580" end="01:08:33.080" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out how to be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.259" end="01:08:36.589" style="s2">good person mm-hmm and I can&#39;t figure it</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.080" end="01:08:39.770" style="s2">out and and I said well what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.589" end="01:08:42.759" style="s2">and she said well how do I be a good</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.770" end="01:08:45.739" style="s2">person when every single thing I do</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.759" end="01:08:50.029" style="s2">every article of clothing every time I</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.739" end="01:08:53.060" style="s2">get in a car or a bus every time I use a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.029" end="01:08:58.609" style="s2">piece of technology every single thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.060" end="01:09:02.060" style="s2">that I do links me to this violent</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.609" end="01:09:07.509" style="s2">exploitation and extraction of our world</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.060" end="01:09:07.509" style="s2">so how do I be a good person mom and</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.380" end="01:09:17.180" style="s2">this is a really important question</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.279" end="01:09:20.779" style="s2">because what it reveals is something</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.180" end="01:09:27.799" style="s2">significant which is that there has been</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.779" end="01:09:31.000" style="s2">a veneer that has been lifted for her</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.799" end="01:09:34.460" style="s2">but I think for a lot of people where</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.000" end="01:09:37.430" style="s2">there was the assumption that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.460" end="01:09:39.680" style="s2">structures that we lived within of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.430" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">justice system and our democracies and</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.680" end="01:09:44.810" style="s2">our you know care systems and our</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:47.180" style="s2">language and our education systems and</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.810" end="01:09:49.489" style="s2">our ideas of success and our ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.180" end="01:09:51.950" style="s2">self-esteem and our ideas of what health</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.489" end="01:09:55.010" style="s2">is and what love is and what right that</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.950" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">all these things we were in that these</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.010" end="01:10:00.610" style="s2">structures provided the structures</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:03.100" style="s2">within which you could be a good person</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.610" end="01:10:09.250" style="s2">mm-hmm we were the good guys</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.100" end="01:10:14.420" style="s2">whoever we is but but that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.250" end="01:10:21.679" style="s2">man behind the curtain has now been</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.420" end="01:10:23.900" style="s2">exposed and so how what do you what do I</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.679" end="01:10:28.250" style="s2">say to my daughter okay what does it</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.900" end="01:10:30.170" style="s2">mean to be a parent in a world where my</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.250" end="01:10:33.320" style="s2">daughter&#39;s asking me this question</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.170" end="01:10:36.530" style="s2">and speaking of memes there will be no</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.320" end="01:10:38.300" style="s2">replying to that question with any of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.530" end="01:10:40.760" style="s2">those you just got to follow your heart</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.300" end="01:10:44.059" style="s2">or it&#39;s not all up to you or you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.760" end="01:10:47.630" style="s2">did it at a those responses with a kid</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.059" end="01:10:50.150" style="s2">that&#39;s that awake you can&#39;t come back</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.630" end="01:10:54.130" style="s2">with that or you lose credibility and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.150" end="01:10:57.340" style="s2">they lose companionship most importantly</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.130" end="01:11:00.530" style="s2">hmm right so how do I remain in</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.340" end="01:11:05.289" style="s2">companionship in the process of going</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.530" end="01:11:10.940" style="s2">into a very unraveling future together</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.289" end="01:11:12.860" style="s2">and so you know the only thing I can</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.940" end="01:11:16.059" style="s2">really say is as long as you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.860" end="01:11:19.190" style="s2">that question we&#39;re on the right track</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.059" end="01:11:24.440" style="s2">mm-hmm keep asking the question mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.190" end="01:11:27.769" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be a easy response</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.440" end="01:11:31.519" style="s2">to that there will be moments when you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.769" end="01:11:34.130" style="s2">know the loss that your generation has</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.519" end="01:11:39.590" style="s2">of having those structures within which</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.130" end="01:11:43.039" style="s2">you can be a good person you know we had</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.590" end="01:11:44.900" style="s2">that that was part of the and when the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.039" end="01:11:49.610" style="s2">world I grew up in that was part of what</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.900" end="01:11:51.170" style="s2">was on the horizon mm-hmm and even</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.610" end="01:11:53.030" style="s2">though I grew up in the household I grew</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.170" end="01:11:59.260" style="s2">up in where it was certainly questioned</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.030" end="01:12:04.730" style="s2">at every moment of the day even I felt</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.260" end="01:12:07.250" style="s2">the low and the comfort of being held in</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.730" end="01:12:09.019" style="s2">those structures that I could do that</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.250" end="01:12:12.050" style="s2">now there&#39;s certainly great things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.019" end="01:12:16.699" style="s2">can be done so and she&#39;s doing great</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.050" end="01:12:18.650" style="s2">work working with addiction and the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.699" end="01:12:20.570" style="s2">trials around addiction especially in</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.650" end="01:12:22.430" style="s2">the Bay Area and the opioid crisis and</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.570" end="01:12:24.710" style="s2">so on so it&#39;s not like she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.430" end="01:12:27.710" style="s2">doing good stuff but that&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.710" end="01:12:30.470" style="s2">right she&#39;s seeing the contextual</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.710" end="01:12:33.470" style="s2">processes that we are with him and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.470" end="01:12:36.790" style="s2">recognizing it&#39;s not enough and here we</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.470" end="01:12:41.360" style="s2">are in an intergenerational moment of</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.790" end="01:12:42.820" style="s2">exploration around this which is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.360" end="01:12:47.540" style="s2">really important too</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.820" end="01:12:50.120" style="s2">this is not just about a particular set</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.540" end="01:12:54.350" style="s2">of people carrying forward this is about</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.120" end="01:12:57.950" style="s2">this this new fiber ring of</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.350" end="01:13:00.560" style="s2">relationships mmm and what is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.950" end="01:13:05.170" style="s2">language that we can even talk about</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.560" end="01:13:09.020" style="s2">these things in this making this tissue</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.170" end="01:13:12.200" style="s2">between us where we are going forward</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.020" end="01:13:19.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s not okay it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.200" end="01:13:27.800" style="s2"> and and that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.600" end="01:13:33.680" style="s2">so I&#39;m thinking also about what it means</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.800" end="01:13:37.550" style="s2">to go into a situation in the minutiae</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.680" end="01:13:41.470" style="s2">of the details but in also in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.550" end="01:13:47.630" style="s2">perception of the context and what is</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.470" end="01:13:52.190" style="s2">what a muscle how do we begin to work</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.630" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">that together and and and help each</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.190" end="01:14:00.380" style="s2">other to go there mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:03.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s what we need is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.380" end="01:14:07.970" style="s2">ability to respond to the detail with an</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.320" end="01:14:09.910" style="s2">understanding of the context yes and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.970" end="01:14:12.500" style="s2">know if you&#39;re just in context that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.910" end="01:14:16.040" style="s2">that&#39;s missing a lot of the picture -</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.500" end="01:14:19.430" style="s2">mm-hmm you have to also be in the detail</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.040" end="01:14:21.710" style="s2">there&#39;s this story in my book about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.430" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">hitchhiker did you ever read that this</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.710" end="01:14:27.140" style="s2">story so when I was a little girl my dad</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:29.240" style="s2">picked up a hitchhiker on the road one</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.140" end="01:14:33.680" style="s2">day we were driving along the highway</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.240" end="01:14:35.610" style="s2">and highway 1 on Big Sur coast which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.680" end="01:14:39.270" style="s2">like mountains and then</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.270" end="01:14:45.179" style="s2">down cliffs and back in those days they</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.610" end="01:14:46.679" style="s2">were virtually no pullouts and he picked</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.179" end="01:14:48.960" style="s2">up a hitchhiker because he loved people</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.679" end="01:14:52.290" style="s2">and this young man jumped in the car</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.960" end="01:14:56.369" style="s2">with this rook Sakon we closed the door</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.290" end="01:15:00.090" style="s2">- you know - VW van right 1978 or</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.369" end="01:15:01.739" style="s2">something and I was ten nine in the</p>

<p begin="01:15:03.570" end="01:15:12.150" style="s2">back then so so and my dad&#39;s driving</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.570" end="01:15:14.130" style="s2">along and he&#39;s just as an aside he was</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.150" end="01:15:16.050" style="s2">maybe the worst driver ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.130" end="01:15:19.489" style="s2">he was constantly looking for whales and</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.050" end="01:15:23.400" style="s2">hustling text focused enough on the Tusk</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.489" end="01:15:25.860" style="s2">so but but in a moment this guy pulled a</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.400" end="01:15:27.989" style="s2">knife on him and there was a knife</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.860" end="01:15:30.719" style="s2">pointing at his side as we&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.989" end="01:15:33.480" style="s2">down this road and significantly what</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.719" end="01:15:36.270" style="s2">happened here is that I never really</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.480" end="01:15:37.860" style="s2">thought about this but someone asked me</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.270" end="01:15:41.429" style="s2">did you ever see your dad in an</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.860" end="01:15:44.210" style="s2">emergency situation and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.429" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s an important question to our</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.210" end="01:15:52.139" style="s2">conversation is it&#39;s about how we are</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:56.159" style="s2">responding in the moment to the detail</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.139" end="01:16:01.469" style="s2">with the complexity on board on bone in</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.159" end="01:16:05.580" style="s2">blood okay so it&#39;s not just about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.469" end="01:16:09.739" style="s2">podcasts right it&#39;s about can you do</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.580" end="01:16:13.170" style="s2">this when it counts oh yeah and so he</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.739" end="01:16:14.940" style="s2">and I said oh no I never saw my dad in</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.170" end="01:16:16.290" style="s2">an emergency situation and then I</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.940" end="01:16:18.300" style="s2">thought about it and I thought you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.290" end="01:16:22.469" style="s2">maybe somebody would actually think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.300" end="01:16:26.070" style="s2">that was an emergency situation so what</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.469" end="01:16:27.659" style="s2">happened was he&#39;s driving along and he</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.070" end="01:16:30.989" style="s2">looked at the knife and he said well</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.659" end="01:16:33.239" style="s2">hello what have we here and then he</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.989" end="01:16:36.889" style="s2">turned to the guy and he said how on</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.239" end="01:16:42.270" style="s2">earth did you get yourself into this and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.889" end="01:16:46.860" style="s2">a conversation began and there was never</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.270" end="01:16:48.130" style="s2">a moment in which there was a spike of</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.860" end="01:16:51.730" style="s2">adrenaline</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.130" end="01:16:54.100" style="s2">in that car the spike never happened</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.730" end="01:16:58.960" style="s2">which is why I never recognized it as an</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.100" end="01:17:02.770" style="s2">emergency because his fluidity with</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.960" end="01:17:04.690" style="s2">complexity was so onboard that when</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.770" end="01:17:06.610" style="s2">there was someone sitting next to him</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.690" end="01:17:09.179" style="s2">with a knife and his side on a two-lane</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.610" end="01:17:15.969" style="s2">road with his kid in the backseat</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.179" end="01:17:19.800" style="s2">he still responded to the the the nest</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.969" end="01:17:23.710" style="s2">of stories that this young man was</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.800" end="01:17:26.760" style="s2">living through and so he didn&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.710" end="01:17:30.100" style="s2">to the knife he responded to the person</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.760" end="01:17:31.510" style="s2">he responded to the person in in all</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.100" end="01:17:34.360" style="s2">these different contextual ways</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.510" end="01:17:40.000" style="s2">simultaneously you can&#39;t game that</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.360" end="01:17:42.460" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s not a game that is you</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.000" end="01:17:45.010" style="s2">can&#39;t script it you can&#39;t pretend it you</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.460" end="01:17:48.150" style="s2">can&#39;t make a methodology for it you</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.010" end="01:17:54.429" style="s2">can&#39;t have a strategy you can&#39;t plan it</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.150" end="01:17:59.380" style="s2">it requires deep and lifetime dedication</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.429" end="01:18:07.540" style="s2">to looking for contextual material in</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.380" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">every detail every detail and and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.540" end="01:18:11.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:15.250" style="s2">important that that&#39;s what it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.710" end="01:18:20.429" style="s2">but in that story there is so much</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.250" end="01:18:25.510" style="s2">theory there is a lifetime of</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.429" end="01:18:28.270" style="s2">communication of physiology of of you</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.510" end="01:18:30.460" style="s2">know not only psychology but of studying</p>

<p begin="01:18:30.460" end="01:18:35.710" style="s2">responsiveness of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.900" end="01:18:37.719" style="s2">calibration of right a until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.710" end="01:18:39.850" style="s2">thought about it and lived in it and</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.719" end="01:18:41.800" style="s2">studied it and studied it and looked at</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.850" end="01:18:45.210" style="s2">it in several different contexts and</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.800" end="01:18:48.580" style="s2">folded it over and over on itself until</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.210" end="01:18:52.270" style="s2">in that moment that&#39;s how you respond</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.580" end="01:18:55.540" style="s2">hmm and we drove another 45 minutes in</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.270" end="01:18:57.630" style="s2">the car and then as we pulled over when</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.540" end="01:19:01.320" style="s2">we got to where he needed to get out and</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.630" end="01:19:05.750" style="s2">my dad gave him a big hug and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.320" end="01:19:08.670" style="s2">a little money and our home phone number</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.750" end="01:19:13.890" style="s2">right and said you know if you need</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.670" end="01:19:16.920" style="s2">anything I&#39;m here and so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.890" end="01:19:19.110" style="s2">also ties into this thing that you were</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.920" end="01:19:23.970" style="s2">talking about about love hmm</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.110" end="01:19:27.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s not love in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.970" end="01:19:31.590" style="s2">Hallmark cards or or or you know pink</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.840" end="01:19:39.300" style="s2">puffy projects it&#39;s it&#39;s love in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.590" end="01:19:42.660" style="s2">sense of brokenness and capacity to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.300" end="01:19:46.500" style="s2">in your own brokenness and be with</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.660" end="01:19:50.010" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s brokenness and go</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.500" end="01:19:52.230" style="s2">forward together and what what what does</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.010" end="01:19:55.650" style="s2">that feel like what does that feel like</p>

<p begin="01:19:55.650" end="01:20:02.490" style="s2">some stuff let&#39;s let&#39;s think about what</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.430" end="01:20:06.750" style="s2">those stories can tell us about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.490" end="01:20:12.210" style="s2">even possible who it&#39;s possible to be</p>

<p begin="01:20:41.610" end="01:20:50.090" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of reasons to chop each</p>

<p begin="01:22:40.640" end="01:22:51.380" style="s2">is totally off the script and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.780" end="01:22:53.750" style="s2">be hacked mm-hmm right so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.380" end="01:22:57.350" style="s2">thing so this is where I feel like our</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.750" end="01:22:59.840" style="s2">community of clever people talking about</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.350" end="01:23:05.090" style="s2">complexities and game B&#39;s and this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.840" end="01:23:09.200" style="s2">that that this is something for us all</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.090" end="01:23:13.090" style="s2">to be so careful with every moment is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.200" end="01:23:16.580" style="s2">think about how we&#39;re gonna go forward</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.090" end="01:23:22.430" style="s2">without hacking the process of going</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.580" end="01:23:23.870" style="s2">forward mm-hmm because then you then the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.430" end="01:23:29.350" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.870" end="01:23:39.320" style="s2">for a response to those details and</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.350" end="01:23:45.500" style="s2">where they might lead becomes obscured</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.320" end="01:23:49.550" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s really important that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.500" end="01:23:52.100" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of care oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.550" end="01:23:55.990" style="s2">right so in if you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.100" end="01:23:55.990" style="s2">parenting that happened in that moment</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:24:02.930" style="s2">so let&#39;s not think about that thing as</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.330" end="01:24:05.420" style="s2">how you deal with a guy with a knife</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.930" end="01:24:10.520" style="s2">let&#39;s think about that story that I just</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.420" end="01:24:15.940" style="s2">told you in terms of how you parent what</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.520" end="01:24:20.150" style="s2">did I learn about life in that moment</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.940" end="01:24:24.560" style="s2">what world was I invited to live with</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.150" end="01:24:29.780" style="s2">him in which that was the communication</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.560" end="01:24:33.680" style="s2">possibility right that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.780" end="01:24:37.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s I feel it yeah and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.680" end="01:24:43.670" style="s2">really significant difference of what is</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.130" end="01:24:46.250" style="s2">this world and so when I&#39;m dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.670" end="01:24:58.070" style="s2">these questions around fear and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.250" end="01:25:00.410" style="s2">unknown they&#39;re not dangling meat hmm</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.070" end="01:25:08.300" style="s2">right I&#39;m not out on the edge of a</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.410" end="01:25:14.590" style="s2">precipice because when I was little I</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.300" end="01:25:18.620" style="s2">saw it held in contextual affection and</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.590" end="01:25:24.230" style="s2">extreme rigor and there was humor and</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.620" end="01:25:29.890" style="s2">there was you know the pain was never</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.230" end="01:25:29.890" style="s2">diminished but neither was</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.780" end="01:25:43.849" style="s2">the folly of humanity right and so so</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.880" end="01:25:48.020" style="s2">that changes the the positioning to</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.849" end="01:25:49.849" style="s2">begin with and maybe that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.020" end="01:25:52.190" style="s2">be really working on like if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.849" end="01:25:54.440" style="s2">work on something maybe that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.190" end="01:25:58.429" style="s2">really need to work on is how do we</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.440" end="01:26:04.760" style="s2">shift the baseline from which we&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.429" end="01:26:07.849" style="s2">talking about the unknown poor and to</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.760" end="01:26:10.940" style="s2">presence that to presence that quickly</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.849" end="01:26:13.579" style="s2">without taking care in the presencing of</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.940" end="01:26:15.949" style="s2">that would strike me as very dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.579" end="01:26:18.050" style="s2">then very dangerous but totally</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.949" end="01:26:19.849" style="s2">dangerous not to we are far more</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.050" end="01:26:22.969" style="s2">dangerous it&#39;s again it&#39;s a double bind</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.849" end="01:26:27.380" style="s2">it seems something that&#39;s come up for me</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.969" end="01:26:28.940" style="s2">a lot recently and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.380" end="01:26:30.469" style="s2">quite the right language to introduce</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.940" end="01:26:32.989" style="s2">and play with but it&#39;s something to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.469" end="01:26:35.360" style="s2">with this notion of that which opens and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.989" end="01:26:39.440" style="s2">that which closes something which came</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.360" end="01:26:42.139" style="s2">up also there was with this young man</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.440" end="01:26:44.889" style="s2">who had the knife there was a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.139" end="01:26:47.810" style="s2">which what there was in him which was</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.889" end="01:26:51.560" style="s2">involved in him making that action was</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.810" end="01:26:53.270" style="s2">not it wasn&#39;t repressed whatever was</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.560" end="01:26:54.260" style="s2">real that caused that situation to occur</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.270" end="01:26:57.110" style="s2">was not repressed</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.260" end="01:26:59.889" style="s2">so it&#39;s an openness enabling of what we</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.110" end="01:27:03.139" style="s2">are in our fullest extent it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.889" end="01:27:08.690" style="s2">shut our eyes to what we may have the</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.139" end="01:27:10.360" style="s2">potential somehow to be yes and this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.690" end="01:27:13.699" style="s2">why the memes are driving me crazy</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.360" end="01:27:16.460" style="s2">because there&#39;s this sort of need to</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.699" end="01:27:17.480" style="s2">present this possible future where we</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.460" end="01:27:20.929" style="s2">get it all right</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.480" end="01:27:23.389" style="s2">and we&#39;re suddenly whole again and that</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.929" end="01:27:26.300" style="s2">wholeness is beautiful and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.389" end="01:27:29.179" style="s2">you know actually this wholeness and</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.300" end="01:27:31.550" style="s2">this capacity for complexity and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.179" end="01:27:34.489" style="s2">capacity to do trans contextual</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.550" end="01:27:36.349" style="s2">understanding and to sense make in this</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.489" end="01:27:37.909" style="s2">space and to have collective</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.349" end="01:27:40.340" style="s2">intelligence right there they all are</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.909" end="01:27:41.570" style="s2">stack stack stack stack stack that all</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.340" end="01:27:45.290" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.570" end="01:27:48.770" style="s2">is actually gonna be really messy and</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.290" end="01:27:51.980" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be kinky and it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.770" end="01:27:54.260" style="s2">weird and it&#39;s not gonna be it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.980" end="01:27:57.110" style="s2">gonna make sense it&#39;s you know one of my</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.260" end="01:28:02.810" style="s2">favorite complexity thinkers on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.110" end="01:28:05.960" style="s2">planet right now is cardi B Wow Wow</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.810" end="01:28:06.530" style="s2">she&#39;s nailing it mm-hmm and it&#39;s messy</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.960" end="01:28:09.440" style="s2">as hell</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.530" end="01:28:12.500" style="s2">mm-hmm and it&#39;s funky and you know she</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.440" end="01:28:15.290" style="s2">when she is expressing herself</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.500" end="01:28:16.460" style="s2">take a look oh yeah oh I don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.290" end="01:28:18.470" style="s2">taking the odd look at stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.460" end="01:28:22.310" style="s2">from time to time yeah and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.470" end="01:28:25.100" style="s2">but that&#39;s where I&#39;m really seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.310" end="01:28:27.830" style="s2">what the future looks like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.100" end="01:28:32.420" style="s2">look like something clean and clear hmm</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.830" end="01:28:36.770" style="s2">it looks like the ability to have hold</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.420" end="01:28:40.580" style="s2">each other in the mess and to have fun</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.770" end="01:28:42.650" style="s2">with it and to get funky with it and not</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.580" end="01:28:48.460" style="s2">be afraid to get pissed off and not be</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.650" end="01:28:51.410" style="s2">afraid to get you know stop tampering</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.460" end="01:28:54.710" style="s2">with the sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.410" end="01:28:56.810" style="s2">and saying which senses are okay and</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.710" end="01:28:58.970" style="s2">which ones aren&#39;t and which which</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.810" end="01:28:59.600" style="s2">modalities are okay and which ones</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.970" end="01:29:02.780" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.600" end="01:29:04.910" style="s2">but like you said that that guy with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.780" end="01:29:11.480" style="s2">knife there was no repression there it</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.910" end="01:29:14.570" style="s2">was simply what have we here mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.480" end="01:29:17.990" style="s2">I I feel that I feel the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.570" end="01:29:21.950" style="s2">that I also feel that we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.990" end="01:29:23.060" style="s2">the end of this recording I also feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.950" end="01:29:26.330" style="s2">that we&#39;re coming to the end of this</p>
