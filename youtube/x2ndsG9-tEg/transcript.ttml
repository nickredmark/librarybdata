<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">accounts of consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">move into another stage of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">and start to consider</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">some actual current theories about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">of consciousness so welcome greg as</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">always it&#39;s a pleasure to have you here</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.600" style="s2">thank you so much yeah you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">got to a really important point about</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">adjectival and adverbial consciousness i</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">think we set up some</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">really interesting things i look forward</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">to bridging into those and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">i&#39;m excited about what we got coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">today great</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">so greg mentioned some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">let&#39;s just do a quick review</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">uh we took a look at how descartes uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t solve but try at least gave good</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">strong indication</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">as to um how one could begin to follow</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">up on the intuition that the function</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">what does consciousness do and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">nature question</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">how does consciousness fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">furniture of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a strange thing how</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">those questions could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">answered in an integrated fashion and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">we took a look at his idea uh of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">pursuing a a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">consciousness and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">and we noted that that&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">intuition and it&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">um that speaks on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">trying to answer the nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">function questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">in integrated fashion and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">what descartes proposed was that uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">animals that are intelligent without</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">conscious consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">have co-variations they have brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">states that covariate with the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">gives them a general and uh a general</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">move around the world navigate the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">we then noted</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">that many theory current theories of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">representation in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">are covariation theories that a mental</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">representation is something in the head</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">that covaries with uh the world or</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">sometimes in the head and body et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">um but many people note within that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">tradition that covariation doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">the specificity of reference that mental</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">representations have</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">um and that descartes seems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">not using those terms but something</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">analogous and it looks like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">consciousness does</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">is out of all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">that all of all the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">of co-variation is object</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:28.090" style="s2">weapon black thing phone birthday gift</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">etc etc etc curtain</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.090" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">what consciousness does is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">aspectulizes it picks out one of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">uh picks up one of those aspects and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">readies it for reason readies it for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">uh behavior we we then noted by making</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">use of an argument from john cyril</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">uh that how deeply that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">realization and consciousness are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">bound together representation</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">presupposes aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">um and then cyril says that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">specialization presupposes consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">i propose to you that we could flip it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">around that aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">presupposes relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">and relevance realization could be used</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">to explain in an integrated fashion both</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">and consciousness via the function</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">of aspectualization yep</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">and then we took a look at what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">might look like uh if we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">how about let me pause you right there</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">for just a second because okay because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">readiness for reason i think is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">really really important</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">point and uh especially because we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">rene descartes doing this in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">relationship to his own</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">human thinking uh what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">reading it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">mine three that rational justifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">but we&#39;re in the animal kingdom okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">priming it uh in some ways to be we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">don&#39;t mean reason in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">justifying proposition but we do mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">holding it and perhaps simulating</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">various counter factual</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">scenarios uh and in my language then</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">calculating various paths of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">investment uh for affordances and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">stressors so now you get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">cortex that actually can really start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">integrate and simulate</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">if you want to connect it to brain-based</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">uh stuff so we can imagine how that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">aspectualizing pulls in and then allows</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">mental manipulation in a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">of way</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">right good excellent and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">uh we took a look at how that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">functionality</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">uh uh might be related to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">and we took a look at michael palania&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">um that is very much a case of i would</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">argue how such</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">a specialization occurs and we took a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">attention being something that bridges</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">between two two kinds of awareness</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">and focal awareness which is awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">of and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that foregrounds things</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">the background we talked about the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">you know the the features in the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">are related so</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">process um</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">and then we took a look at you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">the rudiments of that uh in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">object tracking and the basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">salience tagging um and the work of zen</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">and pollution around this</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">and then we got the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">adjectival folia</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">which tend to dominate the discussion in</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">which is which are the only qualia that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">when you uh load up multiple object</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">that&#39;s experimentally right replicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">and the idea that consciousness the</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">this this and the grouping of them</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">and you need that for categorization you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">the getting it ready for what what they</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">are called reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">what you call right counter factual</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">thought yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">very much right i was just happened to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">see a you know cool video on zip&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know if you know about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">but pareto distribution all that other</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">it was on language okay and the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">common words</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">uh on the of and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">okay so all of those actually words are</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">finsta words</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">they basically are words that then are</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">going to reference where things</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">are rather than what they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">adjectivally you know the nouns verbs</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">so i was just it brought my to my</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">attention how</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">frequently our language is framing</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">finsta</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">kinds of emotions yeah exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">good greg i didn&#39;t know about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">so the idea is you can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">making ready for you know higher</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">higher thought not full-blown reason i</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">grant you that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">but something more uh in this act of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">right we we we salience tag things we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">have the business and the business and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">and then a togetherness i hear now this</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">and then that is what is needed in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">form a category and therefore to form</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">a concept so one way we might talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">is a spectralization is um</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">transforming variations into</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">things that are ready for</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">conceptualization i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">saying full-blown uh reasoning might not</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:39.399" style="s2">be right but something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">at least the beginnings of of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.399" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">so we took a look at all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">that and then we we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">in the pure consciousness event people</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">lose all the adjective polio</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">and all that&#39;s left is right a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">heightened</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">version of the hereness and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">noun-ness and the togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">the the sort of the here now eternity</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">and the togetherness is pure oneness</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">pure unity</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">and so you get kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">gonzfeld</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">of just purely adverbial uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">qualia which is a good argument that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">uh adverbial qualia are uh sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">uh for uh consciousness um</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">and that adjective folia are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">for for for consciousness i want to play</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">with this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">um in that um you could conceive of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">you could conceive of a creature kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">a human monster</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">that had only adjectival qualia</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.600" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">disconnected not capable of being in any</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">way conceptualized</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">patches with the av patches blobs of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">hereness sorry a blueness and greenness</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">that share no fearness</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">no nowness no togetherness is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">that consciousness uh so i&#39;ve regularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">reliably have done this with many people</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">and generally most people&#39;s intuition</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">quite strongly is no that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">seem like consciousness anymore now</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not as strong an argument as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">multiple object tracking argument</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">but at least is a plausible argument</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">that adjective folia</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">are right not sufficient for</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">certainly not the way we fully think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">phenomenology right yeah so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">full phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">when you say oh i wake up okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">asleep i&#39;m unconscious i wake up</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">there&#39;s that there is they&#39;re both what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing in the witnessing function</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">that&#39;s pulling them together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">organizing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">and if you pull that off and said okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">all you had is some felt</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">sense um of adjectival</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">you know whatever right it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">even imagine without the framing but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">can and actually i do believe my my</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">intuition and i think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a hard problem but like</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">pleasure and pain</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">yeah a sort of root qualia that send out</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">that being to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">move you know lean toward lean away</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">as sort of the elements of this uh the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">very early</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">sentient you know the the hinting early</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">sentience</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">that then is going to be witnessed uh by</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">uh higher order processes that really</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">feels to me like the way in which it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">might have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good expect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">a good speculation like to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll share one that i have so i have i</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">have less confidence in what i&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s much more speculative in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">pejorative sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">i have a i have a speculation that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">adjectival qualia</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">might be might be the instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">of that function whereby the where</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">the what&#39;s been made right like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">making ready for conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">you have the spectralized function of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">like of the hereness now in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">togetherness the demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">analog and then you have something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">is actually making it ready</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">to be something like propositional</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">content or conceptual content</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">categorical content and i suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">adjective qualia might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">serving that function i have no good</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">argument or empirical evidence for this</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">so please note uh that&#39;s what what i</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">could i&#39;ll say about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">okay okay so we we went through all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">this and if we go through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">if we go through the multiple object</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">tracking the pure consciousness event</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">the human monster</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">we seem to get an argument that uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">are sufficient adjectives are</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">are not sufficient neither are they</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">and therefore that would sort of lead to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">the conclusion that a verbiago qualia</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">are also necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">uh which means they would you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">logically proper sense constitute</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">essential features</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">uh of consciousness um</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll just say this is what when when i</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">first heard you make this it made me</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">very excited about it because i</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">i was trapped i think in the adjectival</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">qualia i mean they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">salient but but you&#39;re looking through</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">the witness function you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">through roger title</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">right yeah and it is definitely the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">joint of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">um and sort of the separation of them uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">really helped and then when i was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">well what is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">what is the foundational essence of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">when i talk about perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">what i use called phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">knowing i mean that was my general term</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s that witnessing function so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">that really sat for me and it shifted</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">my attention it saw the way i i saw how</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">i was seeing through the lens of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">understanding that shifted and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">i got right into the the witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">function and to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">um that that linked many different</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">things together and definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">afforded some insight so thank you i</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">mean so</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">the idea then the proposal which will</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">need further argumentation and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">is that the the aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">and the hearing as togetherness uh can</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">explained um in terms of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">and recursive relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">and since i&#39;ve got independent arguments</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">published elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">that this relevance realization is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">court of general intelligence that would</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">help explain</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">justify the intuition that there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">connections between general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">and uh consciousness so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">that&#39;s promising about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">i wanna also be clear one more time i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">not saying and i know you&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">greg</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">that adjective of qualia don&#39;t exist i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve even offered a speculation that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t have that much confidence in but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t have any alternative to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">what i think the adjective of qualia</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:40.639" style="s2">might be or might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">we are going to take a look at other</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.639" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">people&#39;s proposals of the adjective</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">qualia</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">we will not find many proposals about</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to be surprising</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">especially when we look at people trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">to address the function</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">right consciousness okay so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">lot to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to keep a look on so this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">brings us to two</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">sort of a decision point as you start</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">down the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">the the enormous tree banyan tree of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">trying to explain consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">um one of the key decision points is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">okay are you going to try and build</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">consciousness out</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">of representational content</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">the content of representation or you may</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">or you could try to build consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">as i&#39;ve been suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">out of the aspectualizing framing</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">that gives rise to representations those</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">are two options available</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">now uh the one i mentioned first</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">is uh far and away the predominant</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">uh uh uh way people try that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">predominant choice that people make</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">uh within cognitive science uh in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">first of all i wanna make clear why i</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">think that is an intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">respectable thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">while at the same time putting it into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">frame that might call it into question</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">i want to argue that trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">understand consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">in terms of representational content</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">excellent cartesian sense if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">you&#39;re in a cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">remember we talked about how the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">basically reduced to its</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">representational function</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">um and consciousness is going to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">be a function of representation the mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">is a purely epistemic engine</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all just about truth and con</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">and truth attaches to the content of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">and then you&#39;d say okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">descartes you know consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">we talked about this is where the mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">touches itself it&#39;s all that&#39;s left of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">conformity</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">well how do representations touch each</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">sorry for sounding graphic uh well what</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">well the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">one representation takes another</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">representation as its content</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">so i can have meta representations i can</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">have recursive representation i can have</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">a representation</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">about a representation in fact most of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">our representations</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">are representations of representations</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.959" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">so the idea that many people have is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll build consciousness out of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">meta representational or this recursive</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">depending on whether you want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">about it structurally</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">or dynamically right this recursive</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">meta representational function now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to fit and this seems so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">intuitive because consciousness feels</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">like it&#39;s always consciousness of some</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">that are representational nature so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">a lot of intuitive plausibility it makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">terrific sense within the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">framework of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve noted though that and then and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">that cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">is massively legitimized by how it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">insinuated seamlessly</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">uh with the scientific worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve already given that argument</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">at length so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">what greg and i also explored though is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">that framework the cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">is tremendously problematic</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">it has it gives you the mind brain mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">body problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">it ramifies through the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">psychology it right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">so our attempts to even get a science of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">the mind going are undermined</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">by it all kind of so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">problematic so on what so i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">be very fair</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">to people here right i respect it makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">good sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">that within the cartesian framework you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">try to build consciousness out of meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">but we should also be suspicious of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s plausible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">intellectually respectable but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">suspicion of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">should also be in our mind because that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">whole framework is in some way</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">causing us a lot of deep and profound</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">about the nature of mind and the nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">within the scientific worldview so how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">that located that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">right on right on par target with me so</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s get into that that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">good so</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">i wanted i i so we do not have the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">or i think between even between us their</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">relevant expertise to cover</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">every single version of this theory</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">that&#39;s been promoted</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">so what i have chosen to do is to pick</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">one version of this theory that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">seminal in that it has influenced many</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s still it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">intellectually respectable in its own</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s seminal also in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">it inseminates many other</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">uh theories uh about consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">this is rosenthal&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">theory which is known as the higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">order thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">right or uh theory well or hot theory so</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s got a sexy mind right</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">yeah um i want that theory</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">uh so there&#39;s sort of four</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">conditions to this theory um the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">are unproblematic uh because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">fourth that is dealing with the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">okay uh so sorry the problem i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">bring up right away</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">so before i get into rosenthal&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the basic</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">problem for any matter representational</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">of consciousness now this is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">not faced by descartes but it&#39;s faced by</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">all of us because we have the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">a lot of processing and we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">this last week with cyril</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">sorry last time was searle a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">is unconscious cognitive processing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">through most of cognitive psychology in</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">cognitive science okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">when you&#39;re going to explain</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">consciousness in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">representation you have to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">the fact that we have many</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">unconscious representations we have many</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">using unconscious representations and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">many of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">unconscious processes are</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.880" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">meta-representational in nature</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">right so i until i speak it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">right i have an unconscious belief</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">that cats are mammals so i have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">representation cat</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">and part of its content is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">representation mammal</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">cat and mammal are not the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">these are distinct representations</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">right right something can be a mammal</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">and not be a cat</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">for example okay so what i have is i</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">have here&#39;s an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">here&#39;s a higher order right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">representation that takes this</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">as its content so that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">right so that there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">processing going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">uh in my memory reconstructive memory</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">might be doing something about my memory</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">of cats and its relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">to other mammals via the connection we</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">know all kinds of stuff&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">okay so you have lots of let&#39;s take it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">that we have good empirical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">and i think pretty readily available</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">very much behavioral evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">that we have unconscious meta</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">and meta-representational processes</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">great let me let me pause you right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">there for just a sec</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">okay so that people so to me one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">that that you you made a point about</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">well descartes sort of has this but he</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">okay and and for me the issue is why</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">does it become</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">reified well it becomes reified through</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">the cybernetic and cognitive revolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">okay where now we have the concept of in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">representation which we can now</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">ontologically map in artificial</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">intelligence and we all</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like oh a system can</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">translate something it can get recursive</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">loops</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">it can make predictions based on</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">uncertainty reduction and we can build</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">systems this way so now</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">we have as part of our sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">right the concept of cognition broadly</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">defined</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">which is going to connect in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">estimation it&#39;s going to connect both to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">well how do like robots behave and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">do you actually coordinate behavior</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">consciousness but consciousness is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">going to get entangled well what do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">mean by</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">phenomenological consciousness right</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">yeah what you&#39;re articulating here is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">well okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">representation on top of representation</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">but actually the cognitive both</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">helps with that or that concept but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">also obscures it because that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">without consciousness thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">much very much thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">and in fact the that example uh greg a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">great&#39;s point brings up a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">example and how this ramifies</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">into the function question which is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">we and you know we&#39;ll come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.000" end="00:23:34.799" style="s2">when we do the chinese room and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">versions of that things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.799" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">we may get very sophisticated machines</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">um that are doing highly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">behavior without consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">and then we remember that we now that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">can explain that behavior we</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">we are capable of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">ourselves as doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">so much that&#39;s intelligent without it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">conscious and so this now again brings</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">up what is consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">for what does it do so you see how the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">nature and the function questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">keep bouncing off of each other because</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">rosenthal is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">giving us a functional account he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">trying to give us an answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:21.559" style="s2">nature okay so let&#39;s so the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">how do you turn unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.559" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">into into conscious representations</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">and and somebody might be saying that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:32.960" style="s2">sounds like the descartes problem of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">co-variations into representation</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.960" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">i think there&#39;s similarity there we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">come back to that so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">but let&#39;s come back to rosenthal&#39;s line</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">so how do i turn unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">into conscious representations the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">i use matter representation the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">is we have overwhelming evidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">that you can have meta representation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">and media representational processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">without there being consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">what does rosenthal say okay so let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">it so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">the first condition is i&#39;m in some i</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">mean some i have some</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">unconscious representational state let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">call that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">a here it is here represented by my</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">right foot okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">and then i have a another</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">unconscious representational state right</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">let&#39;s call this t because it&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">of a right and we&#39;ll come back to what</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">that thought meet what flat means but</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">t is of a okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">and then the third condition is being in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">causes being in t of a so if i have</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">this state it is causal of me</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">having this state is that okay does that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">work so far</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">that works okay uh and we can note that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">the nervous system is hierarchically</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.720" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">arranged definitely right so this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">that this would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">hierarchical levels that&#39;s fine yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">so the problem is as we said we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">already got good argument that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">is not sufficient for turning we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">counter examples we have lots of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">without there being consciousness so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">fourth condition which i call the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">and i can&#39;t remember greg if i came up</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">with that way of calling it or if i got</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">it from somebody else who called it that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s what it&#39;s all i have is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">this meta memory</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">yes call it the intimacy did i did i</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">come up with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">or did i pick that up from somebody if</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">so i public thing if somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">came up with that designation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">right and it&#39;s extant in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">apologies right</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">and if they have it then let&#39;s use it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">because it&#39;s act</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">so the intimacy condition is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">causes t of a without there being any</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">inferential relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">between a and t of a or there being any</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">sensory information passing between a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">and t of a so what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">that there is no epistemic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">between a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">and t of a it can&#39;t it doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">through any kind of sensory information</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">or inferential information why well</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">uh rosenthal wants to block</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">blocking the inferential blocks the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">examples i just gave of cat and mammal</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">right there&#39;s right it blocks that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">so he says no that&#39;s not going to count</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">because the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">a and t of a is non-inferential</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">he also wants to block weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">weird connections that loop through</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">sensory</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">um so let&#39;s use for example pain</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say pain is uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">the a as there&#39;s a tissue damage</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">and then there is the recognition of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">react to respond to tissue damage and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say my tissue is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">damaged but i&#39;m not feeling any pain and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">i look and see blood right and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">sensory information</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">makes me behave in a certain way such</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">that i i pull away no notice my</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">okay because i don&#39;t like the sight of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">does that mean i&#39;m now in pain so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">idea is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">no it&#39;s quite possible that i have the a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">i have a t of a i don&#39;t like the sight</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">of blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">that&#39;s right and so i pull away</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">thing as feeling the pain of the cut</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">right right and so the idea here is you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">want to block</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">those kinds of counter examples as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">you want you want it to be that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">here&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">that there&#39;s some intimate connection</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">a and t of a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">mediated by inferential states it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">mediated by sensorial states of of any</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">is that okay so far that&#39;s okay so far</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">i&#39;m following that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">okay so the the of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">sixty four thousand dollar question now</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">is uh oh sorry that&#39;s our that&#39;s out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">date for people when i was growing up</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">it was a game called the 64 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">dollar question right the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">the the winning the game 64 000</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t very much anymore um um won&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2">might buy it&#39;s not even a terribly</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">expensive car anymore</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.880" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">anyways uh so the question then comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">well if it&#39;s not inferential</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s not via sensory information</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">what&#39;s the nation that&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">the causal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">so let&#39;s grant the intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">that&#39;s correct because if we don&#39;t grant</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">then rosenthal series is just going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">be counter-exampled to death</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">so the key is that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">now that&#39;s a little bit trickier</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">about what it is so we have to get at</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.360" style="s2">that more indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">and what i want to do is i want to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.360" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">a look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">uh two criticisms made by dretzki</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">of rosenthal theories two attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">refute it and then defenses</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">of rosenthal given by senior because</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">they will help</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">clarify what that intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">is okay so</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">rose uh betsy uses the example of pain</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">pain is somewhat problematic for people</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">in terms i don&#39;t mean that it exists or</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s qualia</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">i mean uh of people&#39;s ability to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">parse it phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">um so i use this example which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">generally</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">better for people okay so i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">slightly modify</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">this is just a pedagogical move there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">nothing substantial to it i&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">to slightly modify</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">fretsky&#39;s example and bring it up so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">dretzki says</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">well uh this has happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">um i&#39;m angry</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">right and it&#39;s clearly a a state that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">i&#39;m in uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">but i&#39;m not aware that i&#39;m angry</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">so if you&#39;ll allow me my language</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">i&#39;m angry adverbially so right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">i&#39;m not aware of my anger i&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">through my anger of the world the light</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.279" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">the anger is the lens through which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">seeing things it&#39;s coloring things in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.080" style="s2">you seem particularly threatening to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">right etc</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.080" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">you know you&#39;re hyper salient there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">like you know i&#39;m getting aroused for</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">fighting you and all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">all that sort of stuff but if you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">to ask me at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">or perhaps until you asked me are you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">angry i don&#39;t i&#39;m sure you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">this in therapy all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">right that might that must happen all</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">the time to you right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">okay so yes so the example is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">controversial</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">and then dretzki says well look what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">have here right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">you know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have t of a the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">angry</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">but they&#39;re not aware that they&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re still conscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">that that anger is still a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">okay now first of all notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">happening here notice</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">how this is and and how i could</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">helpfully explain dretski by shifting</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">over to the adverbial</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">and looking awareness through not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">so the language we&#39;ve introduced is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">already helpful</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">for explicating dretzki&#39;s point but</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">steven comes back and says no no no</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a deep mistake okay and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting greg how</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">often and when i&#39;m teaching this</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">argument people make this mistake even</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">after i&#39;ve taught them the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">okay so a is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">unconscious in rosenthal&#39;s model and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">t of a right</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">right dretzki</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">is identifying t of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">with the introspective awareness of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:11.200" style="s2">right so and that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">not we&#39;ve got to go really slowly here</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.200" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">that&#39;s not what roger&#39;s all saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">for rosenthal both a and t of a are</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s only in the intimacy condition that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">the joint</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">the composite of the two achieves</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">right now so t of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">is not your introspective awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">your mental states</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">right so a way of putting that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">might make it easier for people to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">and this is the distinction that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">important there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">between being</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">conscious and being self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">right there&#39;s one more clarification</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s two meanings of self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">one is consciousness of yourself and one</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">is reflective</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">reflexive consciousness i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">latter not the former we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">the former later on</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">me being angry and me and be being aware</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">that i&#39;m angry between being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">and being self-conscious in</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">introspection</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">introspection is the function which by</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">which i become</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">self-conscious of my conscious states</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">is that okay right and so yeah i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">jump this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">in my language system we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">about uh you want to layer this up</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">mind one which is the neurocognitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">functionalism</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">okay and then into mind two which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">going to be i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">a on to t but that&#39;s different from mine</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">okay which is the self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">recursive introspection awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">can report</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">on all of that process exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">right uh you inverted it by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">t of a not amt but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">but i&#39;m inverted for you so i get why</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">um so we so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">higher order thought t</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">of a is not it it is not itself a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">conscious state</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">you have an unconscious state and an</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">unconscious state</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">and when they are in the intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">relation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">the the composite is a conscious state</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">so we shouldn&#39;t confuse</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">right the higher order thought with</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">conscious introspection that is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">mistake good okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">so so let me see if i&#39;m following this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">i think we talked about the duck rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">uh illusion last time</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">right so at one liara you&#39;re bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">the a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">and then you have contact with either a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">duck or a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">right right right okay so then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">have the phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s so when you see the duck</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">there is the contact</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">there right and then when you see a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">rabbit there&#39;s the contact there</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">right and then that&#39;s different also</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">than with the hey what is that like for</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">you when you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">yes yes exactly exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">because presumably animal many animals</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">will probably have the first and lack</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">the second i think there&#39;s a game</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">changer with language on that uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">yes and for example just to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">there seems to be very good uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">developmental empirical</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">evidence experimentally based and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">case study based</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">that children are incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">introspection</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">until they&#39;re about four years of age</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">even though they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">clearly conscious now in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">being the weird weird cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">scientist i am i</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">actually recorded the first instances</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">that were clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">instances of my younger son being</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">introspective because when he was you</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">two to four kids have language actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">no that&#39;s quite sophisticated that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">right you can ask them what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">in their head and they&#39;ll say things</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">like blood</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">or or right</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">my younger son he uh we were driving</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">along in the car he was in the back seat</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">he was just coming into four</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">uh around there and he said oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">snowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">but not outside only in my head</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">right and then there was another one</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">when he came up to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">and he said i have a reverse camera in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">my head</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking what what does that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">and he said and and and i asked him</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">he was getting the and this we know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">this also takes language</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">he was getting auto auto noetic memory</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">he was capable of time travel</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">he was capable of reversing and going</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">back into the pounds</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">interestingly uh just as an anecdote a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">side note i should say</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">i asked him does anybody else have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">reverse camera</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">oh no no</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">no no way man this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s remember to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">and this is a general lesson this is why</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">i introduce it we&#39;ve got to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">throughout</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t confuse a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">things we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">confuse focal awareness with subsidiary</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t confuse consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">with introspective self-consciousness we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">all this thing right and people slam</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">these all together absolutely that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why mine three self-contact</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">introspection is so different than mine</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:24.240" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t have the right language</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">systems you know then you would say no</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.240" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">animals aren&#39;t conscious well if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">mean they&#39;re not great at self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">retrospection and self-report</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">yeah yeah but do they feel pain and have</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">uh a to t experiences you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s right okay so i think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">very useful</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">um uh just again</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">so clarifying clarifying clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">but notice what we&#39;re doing is all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">um this all these explications of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">distinctions all these distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">are each time we do this we are gaining</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">increase in clarity because we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">reliably and systematically reducing</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">the potential for equivocation this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">not niggling</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">we have to do this correctly or we will</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">get it we will get it wrong right we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">get it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">okay now the second argument by dredski</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">against rosenthal is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">interesting in terms of but it tells us</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">more about what that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">intimacy condition might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">so uh dretzki says okay well</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing this t of a what</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">what that means is that all</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">consciousness is consciousness ads</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">it&#39;s all when you and you we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">did this you did uh wittgenstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">duck rabbit all seeing is seeing as</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">all consciousness is consciousness as</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">guess what ass spectralization so as</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">bang back on the table again without</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">or all of this but it&#39;s here it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">to take a central role</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">and then dretzki says okay so if</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">rosenthal is right</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">then right every conscious state</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">is going to be aspectualized</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">and then he argues and says but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">there doesn&#39;t seem to be any aspect</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">to in any state of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">so let&#39;s use i could i could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">conscious of it as a duck</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">as a rabbit as a black and white blob</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">as a smear as the thing that greg often</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">refers to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">right no one so and then jessica says</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">but look</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:49.480" style="s2">none of these aspects are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">and then he concludes so</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.480" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">aspectualization is not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">and since rosenthal is committed to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">specialization</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">i have thereby refuted his theory and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">senior points out that&#39;s a modal fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">the fact that no one particular aspect</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">is necessary that you cannot conclude</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">that no aspect is necessary let me give</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">you an example</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">okay i&#39;m talking about bodies not matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">bodies</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">okay is everybody clear about that so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">every body i encounter has a shape</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">but is any particular shape necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">being a body like do you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">rectangle to be a body</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">nope do you have to be a sphere you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">to be there is no</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">shape that&#39;s necessary but does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">lead me to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">that shape is not a necessary feature of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">being a body</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a moral mistake the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">each one</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">might be individually not necessary does</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">not lead to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">that the entire set can be excellent</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">a category right exactly now notice what</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">that shows you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">it shows you first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">really can&#39;t be separated from</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">consciousness and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the process of actual</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">spectralization</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">not the specific aspect that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">to consciousness it derives us this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">completely independent argument</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">right but it leads to the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">that the process not the not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.319" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">particular set of attributes</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">revealed by a particular aspect but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">the process of aspect realization itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary to consciousness now</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">what i want to suggest to you is that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">should consider</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">the aspectualization process as exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">the intimacy relation</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">that is needed that it turns right</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">unconscious co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">right into things ready to be mapped</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">into potentially unconscious concepts</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve been talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">that is the process</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">that is the intimacy intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">of consciousness why would i make that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">argument well first of all we already</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">it&#39;s independently motivated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">independently motivated by how</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">aspectualization has come to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s also going to be motivated by a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">second argument which</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">well let&#39;s take a look at while always</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">keeping the intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">clearly in hand let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">higher order thought theory what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">a thought i mean it&#39;s a really vague</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">term it&#39;s an equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">so one thing that you might</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">try is that higher order thoughts are</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">higher order thoughts or beliefs so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">t is of a is t</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">is a belief about a so i&#39;m in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">particular state</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">and then i get a belief about that state</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">and the belief about that state</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">um and what one of the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">that is belief is</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">different from just conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">so that might give you a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">wiggle room</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">the problem with that of course is we</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">have unconscious beliefs about our</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">we already have that and they remain</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">unconscious uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">so and this points to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">differences between belief</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">and consciousness our beliefs don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">processes that occur they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">dispositions to behave this is a classic</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">argument made by gilbert raw</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">so until i spoke it i i i</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">i still believe it but until i spoke at</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">it right it was in no way</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">um conscious to me i believe that africa</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">is the continent</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">now i&#39;ve had that belief all day</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">it all day in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">africa as a continent africa as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">continent africa&#39;s a continent</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">or doing like sorting things into</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">continents and putting africa into</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">like i&#39;ve just i&#39;ve been doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">with africa incontinence all day</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">right and that nevertheless i have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">belief so what is it to have the belief</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">well i mean it&#39;s a very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">notion but it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">like if i have to categorize continents</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">i will put out</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">africa into the category if you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">this question i&#39;ll answer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">right and so beliefs aren&#39;t current</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not happenings</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">they&#39;re conditional relations but</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">whatever the hell consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">it is occurring it is a current thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">right yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">so one of the way you might get around</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">it is by saying well the belief isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">the current</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">but this is occurring but then how</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">what the relationship between a</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">non-occurring state and occurring state</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">is such</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">that the overall result is occurring is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">you know unclear but</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">you seem to be able to direct your</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">consciousness in a way that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">your beliefs there&#39;s a voluntary aspect</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.079" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">and i don&#39;t need to belable this with</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">argument because there&#39;s a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:45:59.599" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">of a deep association between</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.599" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">consciousness and free will</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not arguing for free will i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">claiming it exists</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">all i&#39;m pointing to is there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">about consciousness that leads people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">consciousness is a self-moving free</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">thing your beliefs don&#39;t function that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">belief is not something you do uh pick a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">belief you&#39;d like to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">i i would like i would like to have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">belief which</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">and to believe something is to believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s true right i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">like to have the belief that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">loves me okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">okay let&#39;s do it let&#39;s do it now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">gonna start believing it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">i can say it to myself everybody loves</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:38.079" style="s2">me but i don&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">right uh i can imagine it i can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.079" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">all the people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">we love you john but i can imagine i</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">could desire it</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">i could fear it i can hope it but none</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">of those things are the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">believing it belief doesn&#39;t work though</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">in fact i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">i&#39;m always unclear what is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">happen when televangelists</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">asked me to believe like believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">and i i feel like i i sort of clench</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like mental constipation i</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">sort of clench</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">what am i doing what like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m supposed to be doing right</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">and what they&#39;re basically saying is</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">stop criticizing stop reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">and if you do all those things that will</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">then cause you to come to a state</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">of belief right um so all of that being</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:21.920" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">uh and there&#39;s more what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.920" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">point out is belief doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">belief it&#39;s just not the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">thing thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">yeah for consciousness so we we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">more of a process</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t some important sense you</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">self-organizing dynamic recursive</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">uh right and so i suggest</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">you that something that is occurring</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">definitely uh is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">uh something that is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">and we already have independent</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">arguments that it converts</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">unconscious things into things</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:08.960" style="s2">that are ready for</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">reason or ready for conceptualization of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.960" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">bringing of an a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">and a t of a together is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:16.520" style="s2">aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">the process of seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.520" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">so that i now am aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">a particular aspect of the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">that makes it ready poised for me to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">entertain</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">concepts conceptual problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">right and so i would propose to you that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually talking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">intimacy condition</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">is the process of aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">yes so let me see how this uh sits with</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">as a metaphor sure okay so</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">um for me one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">sometimes use as a metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">how the brain when sort of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">structure of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">is pulling its focus all right is like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">stadium</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">okay and each of the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">audience members each of the fans right</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">is tracking</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">a particular aspect of say the game</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">right right and there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">frame that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">constraining and orienting the key</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">aspects</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">of change yes right okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">somehow the collective of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">okay is harmonizing so there are these</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">yeah where they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">track the particular elements all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">so if we put this into a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">model okay uh or at least and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">i&#39;m being metaphorical here but</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">i want to be drawing the brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">connection right if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">if there&#39;s a frequency of the fans that</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">are tracking</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">okay they&#39;re tracking different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">of change that are relevant right uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">then that&#39;s that that&#39;s a way to bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">the collective to map</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">the a to t it seems yes yes yes okay and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll go one step further if we then</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">bring this up into social psych with</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">this analogy</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">right what aspects of the game and how</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">are they actually being attended to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">indeed this will get into some mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">three justifying</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:19.280" style="s2">you probably know this one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">earliest examples of social psych and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.280" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">uh was they looked at a football game</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">that was particularly rough and brutal</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">okay they had two fans i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">dartmouth and princeton if memory serves</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">and they ask which which team was by far</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">the more</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">cheating aggressors in the game okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">who were the dirty players</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">and who wasn&#39;t the dirty players right</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">well guess what all the princeton fans</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">said those dartmouth bastards they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">right and they had all these penalties</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">and our guys are just reacting and of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:50.760" style="s2">course you&#39;re flipping around</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">okay all right so so the so the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.760" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">aspectualization if we start to think</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">what frames of mind are people looking</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">through and how are they setting up</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">to see the co-variation across multiple</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">levels we can then start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">pull so i&#39;m pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">the stadium idea of the brain into also</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">that&#39;s good let&#39;s pick up on that a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">little bit that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">uh so first of all again uh and greg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:15.960" style="s2">done this before and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">uh bring it foreground it this</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.960" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:21.040" style="s2">is a framing and it is a relevance</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.040" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">and notice a couple of things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">and this is going to be down the road</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">i&#39;m going to say that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">when the aspect realization is in</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">you know doing this reading for reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">reading for</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">but when the aspect realization actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">affords perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">full-blown consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">and but notice what&#39;s happening also the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">perspective of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">so you know uh it was was bound up</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">with the participatory knowing of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">observers</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">these one group of people have they</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">right as dartmouth the other was it</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">plymouth or again</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">i think princeton i may be mistaken on</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">this but it doesn&#39;t matter no no it</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">right so they&#39;re participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">the kind of identities they assume</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">and the kind of identities they assign</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">and the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">literally here the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">i&#39;m glad you picked up yeah i was like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">so appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">the participatory knowing right uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">uh it it shapes the framing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">so that only certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">are are are sort of possible and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">that perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">as greg said right it is constraining</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">the aspectualization so</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:48.880" style="s2">only certain aspects are coming out</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">and that of course then affords what</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.880" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">right people can be bring to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">what skills they can acquire within that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s the procedural knowing and no</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">is happening um in ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">that seem to involve consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.359" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">before we get to that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">propositional narrative right but then</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">we would then nest them in layers of so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">i say to my guy you know i&#39;m there with</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">my buddy from dartmouth and did you see</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">that and he says of course i see that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">now we have a shared collective</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">intelligence that those princeton guys</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">are this way and then we frame our</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">justifications which frames our</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">prospective knowing</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">which frames our projected participation</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">as fans into the system</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s that constant you know we could</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">see that relation</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.880" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">across those various levels as to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.800" style="s2">know as to how two</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">sides can watch the exact same game and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.800" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">come across and of course as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">therapist i see this in marriage there</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">all the time in terms of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">oh my god is this</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.720" style="s2">you know you hear one side like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">god how do they live with that person</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.720" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">you hear the other side like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">how do you live with that person</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">right um so it&#39;s so just the nested</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">layers of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">this aspectualizing uh across these</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">is a very i think it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">powerful thing to understand the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">participatory relations that we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">engaged</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">i think that&#39;s fantastic um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">one of the ways of course you show the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.079" style="s2">value of a scientific theory</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">is not only its empirical adequacy how</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.079" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">can it explain the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">consensus evidence and data um you also</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">write you one something that argues</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">for a theory i&#39;m not claiming this a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">full-blown scientific theory but</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">we&#39;re working towards it is the degree</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">to which it is fruitful the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">which it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">bring make makes things clear that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">not clear before</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">brings in new phenomena that could now</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">be considered relevant</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">evidence for the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">consciousness uh that might</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">you know it&#39;s less likely without this</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">that we would consider things happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">as particularly relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">understanding the nature and function of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">consciousness but this language allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">us to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">allows us to see things happening um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">within the therapeutic context as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">so notice where we&#39;ve gotten to because</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re in a kind of a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">interesting place here</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">we we we we were playing it i&#39;m sorry i</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">keep running with it we were playing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">the cartesian ball park</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">sorry there&#39;s a part of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.359" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">solid we&#39;re going to do it with you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">representational content of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">representational content</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">we hit this you know really thick</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">uh uh and so we put in the intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">uh we try to get clear about what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">intimacy condition is and lo and behold</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">we find that right in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">responding</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">uh to uh criticisms by dredski</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">um and in terms of avoiding the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">that are prohibited</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">in the intimacy uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">condition uh we we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:02.400" style="s2">zeroing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">on the process of a specialization</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">as actually the best candidate and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">and i mean i i i i hope people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:13.520" style="s2">feeling this like a sneaky ninja</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">uh jiu jitsu move or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">but as we in good faith i i it was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">good faith tried to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">this argument and the debate around it</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">we seem to have shifted to</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s better to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">consciousness out of the process</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">of aspectualization rather than out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">content of our representations yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">absolutely and i think that what and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">i&#39;ll just say also</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">i&#39;m a i my you know they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">models of truth of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">foundationalism there&#39;s correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">there&#39;s coherence whatever my genetic</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">system got lined up coherence</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">is certainly something i find myself</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">enormously</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:57.200" style="s2">interested in and so for me when i get</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">really excited when i take something</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.200" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">it coheres with a lot and it applies</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">into these different domains</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">and it feels does so in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">most parsimonious and starts to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">create you know symphonic harmony</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:10.960" style="s2">between different domains that</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">that is and so that&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">i like this so much is because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">what happened to me as i listened to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">this through</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">i could then apply it network stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">together across a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">generalities so for me</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">that truth criterion is a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">important one</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">so thank you for saying that craig</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful i i also want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">return the favor and point out that greg</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">did something</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">uh very very smart uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">because the analogy is also a seed</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">analogy that analogy</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">is going we&#39;re going to ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">remember it remember the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">the stadium analogy uh because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">of uh the analogy that&#39;s at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">bernard barr&#39;s theory called the global</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">workspace theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">uh which is one of the prominent uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">clear and there&#39;s a neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">version of it with the hain a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">scientific and neuroscientific theory of</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">um and it is a theory that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">just a foreshadow it&#39;s a theory that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">trying to answer the function</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">um the function question and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">argues that the function of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:21.760" style="s2">is relevance realization so again</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a convergent argument that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.760" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">going to be reaching towards</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:28.079" style="s2">the relevance realization it also is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">crucial in linking to working memory</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.079" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">which is crucial in</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">intelligence and problem solving and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll come back to that argument</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">relevance realization seems to be very</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">crucial for working memory</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">especially the work of my colleague at</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">uft lynn hasher</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">and that working memory has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">with general intelligence as greg just</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">but of course there seems to be deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">connections between consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">working memory especially</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">if consciousness gives us some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">for counterfactuality</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">but right uh and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">um what&#39;s interesting about all of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">is the connections</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">that we can make between consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">working memory</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">and general intelligence and between</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">different theories about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">working memory and intelligence so uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s uh really really powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">if you&#39;re if one&#39;s intelligence like</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">mine orients towards coherence</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">all of a sudden you start seeing music</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.200" end="00:59:33.040" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">um that sort of got us to an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">and now that&#39;s going to bring up a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.240" style="s2">uh this another distinction uh in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.240" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">um and uh we&#39;ll come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a just and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">controversial distinction</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">but it&#39;s a powerful one that many people</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">is um useful uh distinctions are</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">justified by their use</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="01:00:01.760" style="s2">right because they have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">deciding the relative relevance of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">so nedblock famously made a distinction</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.359" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">between access consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">phenomenal consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">um and access consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">is basically that things are conscious</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">and again again i don&#39;t even know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:26.799" style="s2">aware of some of this historical</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">but access consciousness is when things</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">are poised</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">uh when there are mental contents</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">that are poised they have been readied</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">for reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">or what we&#39;re saying they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">readied for this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">more more more counter factual</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">intelligent behavioralization</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">yeah stimulation right</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">simulation yeah yeah oh sorry i said</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">simulation didn&#39;t i oh i heard</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:53.920" style="s2">stimulation whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">oh well i think i might have said it but</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.920" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">what was in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">was simulation okay uh and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">and greg and i will talk about how</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s probably an active simulation</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:08.480" style="s2">rather than any kind of propositional or</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:09.839" style="s2">pictorial or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.480" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">and we&#39;ll come back to that later so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.839" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">some of you might be getting ah right</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">just wait</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">a fully embodied 4e version of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">simulation is</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">what what we&#39;re going to argue for uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:20.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s not that uncommon by</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.680" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.160" end="01:01:24.160" style="s2">so but that&#39;s down the road so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">back to what&#39;s going on with block</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">right and notice what we&#39;ve got here</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this readiness for reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:32.160" style="s2">and again well what does that look like</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">well it</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.160" end="01:01:35.839" style="s2">he calls this access consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s like you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.839" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">things are being poised to be brought</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">working memory and used and what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">good candidate for that well a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">candidate for that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very processed we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">about this aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">this getting things ready right for</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">their categorical identity</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">all that stuff that we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:58.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">in a related manner and they argue a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.079" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to go a bit on</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">access consciousness before i go back to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">phenomenal consciousness in a related</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:12.160" style="s2">manner uh michael ty has argued for</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">um uh sort of a way of talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.160" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">um uh consciousness um</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">and and he and and he and black seem to</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.319" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">argue around this point of poisonous</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">um and access and it it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:29.200" style="s2">if if it&#39;s a deep difference that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">rest of us should care about</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.200" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">or if it&#39;s the narcissism of small</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">differences so well welcome to</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">this is not primarily a scholastic</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">endeavor greg and i are</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:47.039" style="s2">are engaged and so i&#39;m going to put that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">you know that intricacies aside i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.039" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">just briefly go over what ty says</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">so tai says that you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:02:56.720" style="s2">the the functional nature of conscious</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about consciousness he has</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.720" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">what he calls</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">panic it&#39;s an acronym uh so</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:04.559" style="s2">um what turns an unconscious state into</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">a conscious state</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.559" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">it&#39;s poised in the way we&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s readied right it&#39;s it&#39;s go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">being i would argue or i think you would</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">argue with me</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">it&#39;s being the demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:20.319" style="s2">all that stuff&#39;s going on that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">readied right for concept</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.319" end="01:03:24.400" style="s2">categorization conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:28.079" style="s2">potentially counter factual simulation</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.400" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">etc all of that okay so</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.079" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s abstract now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:34.799" style="s2">going to be something we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">come back to uh you&#39;ll see why in a sec</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.799" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">all right it&#39;s non-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s non-conceptual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">intentional content</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">okay so the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">unconscious con unconscious content</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.640" end="01:03:54.799" style="s2">and conscious content is panna now of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">course they both share</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.799" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">content so that falls out um the fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:02.160" style="s2">that it it&#39;s intentional that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">about something</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">um that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:09.920" style="s2">just to say that the content is in some</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">sense plausibly</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.920" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">representational or at least intentional</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">and again</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">the fact it&#39;s plausible that many people</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">would see</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">unconscious representations as having</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the i and the sea of panic</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:26.559" style="s2">a lot of the distinguishing work they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">needed there because if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">inc</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">the rest doesn&#39;t work so if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">me a bit of a greek pun</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.000" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">pan is doing all of the work uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">so poise get that man a mic</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:46.079" style="s2">okay why is abstract non-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">so the the the the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.079" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">abstract is non-cons it&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">it&#39;s also non-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.240" style="s2">now we can talk about non-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.240" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a non-conceptual thing going</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">on with all of the aspectualization and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">the fence thing and the adverbial</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">right right all that stuff so</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s okay but normally when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:11.839" style="s2">abstract we talk about something that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">higher on a taxonomic order</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.839" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">so vehicle is more abstract than car</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">which is more abstract than mustang</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:19.599" style="s2">which is more abstract than my old</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">mustang</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.599" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">right right right and so i move up so</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">uh now but that taxonomies are precisely</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">conceptual structures</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">so what does non-conceptual abstractness</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:36.559" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">so here is a proposal we can&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.559" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">out of propositional content because</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s non-conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.440" style="s2">so the abstractness has to be procedural</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">in nature</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.440" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">well what would procedural abstractness</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.119" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">means and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;m giving a proposal i think procedural</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">abstractness is generalizability</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">the degree to which i can apply</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">a procedure across a wider diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">is the degree to which it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">procedurally abstract</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.760" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:18.559" style="s2">and so what we need is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:23.119" style="s2">poisonous that is that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.559" end="01:06:26.559" style="s2">generalized procedure</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.119" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">and what seems to be the one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.559" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">general procedures of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">well aspectualization aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:40.880" style="s2">no matter where we go if i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:44.400" style="s2">any particular representational content</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.880" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">i first have to do the aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.400" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">that will get me into the place in which</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:55.599" style="s2">the conceptualization can then occur</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">so i think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.599" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">access consciousness like just again</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">making a convergent argument</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:04.319" style="s2">um block and from time can be understood</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.319" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">in this very general process which</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">i think is a instantiation of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.680" style="s2">the what i think is one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:17.839" style="s2">procedurally general things we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.680" end="01:07:19.680" style="s2">which is our capacity for relevance</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.839" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.680" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">all right all right so what i&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:26.480" style="s2">is a convergent</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:30.160" style="s2">argument that access consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.480" end="01:07:32.240" style="s2">basically doing this aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.160" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">function this higher order relevance</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.240" end="01:07:35.960" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">what i&#39;m going to argue in fact is</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.960" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">aspectualization is basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">right and we already did it with the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">salience tagging</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">um relevance is becoming salient</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:50.880" style="s2">where salience is relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">either if you want to talk structurally</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.880" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">to working memory or we want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">functionally</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">it&#39;s uh relevance right</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">to this relevance within perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:04.079" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">right so we&#39;re going to come back to all</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.079" end="01:08:08.400" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">so uh and i&#39;ll say also so from a</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.400" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">investment so i&#39;m always so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">embedding this in the whole organism</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">that&#39;s why i love foreign</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">right and why i love relevance</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">is because what does the organism need</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:25.759" style="s2">to do to invest it needs to know what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:26.560" style="s2">uh and what it might be able to create</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.759" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">to make</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.560" end="01:08:31.279" style="s2">today right yeah so it is in the process</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">all the way through of like okay where</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">am i and what might be possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">as i invest and so that that dual sided</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:40.799" style="s2">element of realization that you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah right it&#39;s like okay i</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.799" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">got to detect what it is and then what i</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">what can i realize with it and that goes</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">so deep into this structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">right and and both of those stages hit</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">the problem of combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.640" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">but in and allow all the way down</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:57.199" style="s2">through the scale in a fractal sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.480" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">way as far as</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">yeah exactly exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">so i mean i have a lot more on this but</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">what i&#39;ve tried to do is make plausible</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">perhaps we should try and build</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">consciousness at least access</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:16.159" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.239" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">uh out of aspectualization now what</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.159" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">about phenomenal consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">well phenomenal consciousness is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">home of the adjectival qualia</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">right um and if there&#39;s controversy</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">about what it is and what it might be</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">ned block has what he calls sort of a a</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">mental paint</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:33.440" style="s2">uh analogy it&#39;s sort of a mental paint</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:35.759" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.440" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">attaches to things and it&#39;s irreducible</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.759" end="01:09:39.520" style="s2">uh to conceptual content it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:43.040" style="s2">irreducible to functionality</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.520" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">um uh like i said</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.040" end="01:09:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s if that mapping is correct that</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">sounds like adjectival qualia to me</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.400" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">and that means that it&#39;s not clear that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">or sufficient for consciousness i also</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">worry</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:58.800" style="s2">on the other end of making it completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">non-functional</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.800" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">makes it epi phenomenal yep which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.760" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">going to be very problematic</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">right so that&#39;s why i like to i do like</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.400" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">kind of idea a little bit uh and then i</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">love saw the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">access blocks uh distinction here so uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:16.800" style="s2">if we go back to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.320" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">you know my intuition at least is is</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.800" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">pleasure and pain are flashes of paint</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">across the nervous system yeah okay that</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">then that then</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">try to orient the whole brain approach a</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">void and that&#39;s and so that&#39;s the early</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">you know and then you know then it</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:34.640" style="s2">spreads off of there and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:35.679" style="s2">getting this access conscious witnessing</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.640" end="01:10:37.120" style="s2">system that&#39;s good greg</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.679" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">let can we let&#39;s we got a couple minutes</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.120" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">let&#39;s play with that okay i mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:42.800" style="s2">we should we should try and do a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">bit of the logos in the midst of all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.800" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">this right um</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">so let me play with that a little bit so</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:49.440" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">of course pain and pleasure are salients</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.440" end="01:10:52.239" style="s2">or salience tigers but</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">your point is they&#39;re not just sailing</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.239" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">staggers things can be salient without</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">being painful</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:10:59.280" style="s2">or pleasurable so i agree with you there</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">but but it&#39;s interesting because pain</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.280" end="01:11:03.280" style="s2">and pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">right are are are less distinct which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.280" end="01:11:05.840" style="s2">your point</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re procedurally</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.840" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">abstract in the way we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:10.320" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">they generalize across many domains in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.320" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">red and even red and greenness won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">generalize</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">and so maybe are are they part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">an initial procedural categorization</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:25.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">approach avoid right right so</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.920" end="01:11:29.360" style="s2">wow it&#39;s neat because then it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:32.560" style="s2">really right at the level between</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.360" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">sort of salience and the so if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.560" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">allow me sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">uh proto uh adjective qualia right yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s right it&#39;s right in the right area</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.120" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:43.840" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re suggesting 100 so</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.120" end="01:11:46.000" style="s2">right these are</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.840" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">nature signals to approach and avoid</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.000" end="01:11:49.280" style="s2">their nature</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">signals to approach and avoid so so and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.280" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:54.640" style="s2">that then basically is a sort of like so</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:56.159" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.640" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">what i call the pleasure pain parallel</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.159" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">fitness principle okay so</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive and negative</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.679" end="01:12:02.400" style="s2">correlation of energy investment</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">associated with survival and</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.400" end="01:12:06.239" style="s2">reproductive security</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:07.040" style="s2">sure and then you get embedded in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.239" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.040" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">capacity for behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">repertoires get more and more</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:13.840" style="s2">sophisticated more and more flexible</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">it goes from fixed action patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.840" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">reflexive withdrawal systems</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">to coordinated guidance towards</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">particular outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">that are much more flexible and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:25.520" style="s2">feed back on your consequences</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">okay and then you get feedback on</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.520" end="01:12:29.679" style="s2">consequences you then have</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:30.800" style="s2">bing pleasure pain splashing across the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.679" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.800" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">okay and then a capacity to specialize</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">around that</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">and then all of a sudden be guided by</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:39.679" style="s2">that increasingly sophisticated smart</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:42.800" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.679" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">right that&#39;s cool so right</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.800" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">right so let me try and do this</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">phenomenologically you have like</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">you have some basic here now this</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">togetherness the adverbial thing and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got salience</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">and then what what what what&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">sort of picturing in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know this right is you get</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">sort of a specification of salience</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">right it&#39;s still not it&#39;s not sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">located</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not a property of an object yet</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.040" end="01:13:10.480" style="s2">to something being painful is not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:13.120" style="s2">property of any</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.480" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">particular thing right it&#39;s just you see</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.120" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a specialization of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:19.120" style="s2">salience that</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">if there&#39;s a qualitative change there</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.120" end="01:13:23.280" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.640" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s right on the order yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:26.560" style="s2">right well so the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">so here&#39;s another way of framing it okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.560" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">so uh in terms of the dynamic feedback</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">loop</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">of what i would call the whole of</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">phenomenological knowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">okay which is going to be procedural</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.800" end="01:13:40.719" style="s2">right uh what i did is i constructed</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">what&#39;s called the pme</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.719" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">loop okay the pme is the perception</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna then</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">create the aspect realization and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">integration will be higher up in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:53.600" style="s2">animal kingdom of the integration of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:55.040" style="s2">adjectival into at by adverbial so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.600" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">now seen through we have them</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.040" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">and then that&#39;s referenced against your</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.960" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">motivational state of approach a void</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">right right right so now i have a i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">hungry i want to eat this thing and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">being eaten over here right right right</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.040" end="01:14:09.760" style="s2">so i have an approach template to eat</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.760" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">okay and then avoid template to eat that</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">to a bee</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:17.600" style="s2">eaten by that so and just to even as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:20.320" style="s2">like i&#39;m camping i get hungry i know my</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">my uh sandwich is over there right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.320" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">then all of a sudden i&#39;m like oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:25.600" style="s2">hungry i&#39;m gonna then</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:27.840" style="s2">organize my investment all right to</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.600" end="01:14:28.400" style="s2">reduce the discrepancy between where i</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.840" end="01:14:31.040" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">and to make salient that path of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.040" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">as i do that and i get in there i found</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">oh here&#39;s the sandwich</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">that i want i get more and more pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">affect as i reduce the discrepancy</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">to my goal so i start getting the jolt</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:44.159" style="s2">there that says reinforce and do more of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">okay then all of a sudden i get a a bear</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:49.920" style="s2">pops up</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:51.600" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see a bear pops up now</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.920" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">all of a sudden i have an image</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.600" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">of getting eaten i&#39;ll have an idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">the bear moving towards me</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:14:59.840" style="s2">okay which then activates all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.000" end="01:15:01.760" style="s2">avoidance fear-based motivation</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.840" end="01:15:03.280" style="s2">i back up and tail hightail it out of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.760" end="01:15:05.600" style="s2">the car right</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.280" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m in a dynamic relation between</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.600" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:09.440" style="s2">creating perceptions referencing them</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2">against goal states</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">and having jolts of emotion to energize</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:15.280" style="s2">myself accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.760" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s pick up on that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.280" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">good let&#39;s go to the other end though</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:20.719" style="s2">let&#39;s do the pair of music the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">paramecium approaches and avoids</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.719" end="01:15:24.159" style="s2">but i&#39;m not quite sure we could</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">attribute pain and pleasure to it</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.159" end="01:15:27.760" style="s2">and here&#39;s the difference because it</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:29.600" style="s2">came out in your example</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.760" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">because you did that you know you did</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:33.040" style="s2">the the improvement</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:34.080" style="s2">of optimal grip the reduction of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:37.640" style="s2">discrepancy</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.080" end="01:15:41.040" style="s2">because pain and pleasure are a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.640" end="01:15:44.719" style="s2">specification of salience across</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.040" end="01:15:46.480" style="s2">time that affords learning right and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.719" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">that it right again we&#39;re bringing in</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.480" end="01:15:51.280" style="s2">intelligence so</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">pain and pleasure then like like i said</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:54.239" style="s2">i i i hadn&#39;t thought about this</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:55.679" style="s2">but your point is really cool they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.239" end="01:15:57.840" style="s2">they&#39;re fascinating they&#39;re they sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.679" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">hover between adjectival and adverbial</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.840" end="01:16:00.640" style="s2">folia</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">right and what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.640" end="01:16:05.760" style="s2">opening up salience</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:07.120" style="s2">to being specified across time so that</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.760" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">learning and flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.120" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">flexible response is possible is that a</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">fair representation</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:14.800" style="s2">absolutely i also think that they sit</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:16.560" style="s2">right in that weird space of realization</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.800" end="01:16:18.239" style="s2">that they&#39;re detecting what is and</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.560" end="01:16:19.360" style="s2">orienting what ought to be so that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.239" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">have that energy</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.360" end="01:16:22.640" style="s2">to create really i mean we as lived</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">organisms we</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.640" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">sit in a nest of is on right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:29.040" style="s2">you have to do that and so i see it as</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.040" end="01:16:32.640" style="s2">it yolks that stuff together across the</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.640" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic well that was all</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">that was all the content the pun</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:42.080" style="s2">intended that i wanted to uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:43.280" style="s2">get across uh for today um i think we</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.080" end="01:16:46.880" style="s2">made some excellent</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.280" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">progress um uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.880" end="01:16:53.280" style="s2">what what did we do well we saw that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">higher order theories seem to</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.280" end="01:16:59.120" style="s2">converge back towards aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:00.320" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve talked about you know how</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.120" end="01:17:02.480" style="s2">that also now involves</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.320" end="01:17:04.719" style="s2">shifting from relevance to salience and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.480" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">then we did some</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.719" end="01:17:07.760" style="s2">a discussion about uh access versus</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.640" style="s2">phenomenal</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.760" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">and again we seemed to get right we seem</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.640" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">to really thicken up access so it did a</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">lot of the work that</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:17.040" style="s2">is usually attributed to phenomenal</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.360" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.040" end="01:17:21.199" style="s2">and then we did something really</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:24.719" style="s2">interesting we speculated about</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.199" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">sort of um the emergence</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.719" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">of adjective qualia out of adverbial</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">via uh you know pain and pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">and how they seem to be well at least at</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:38.800" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">right now this sort of specification of</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.800" end="01:17:42.159" style="s2">salience</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">across time that affords learning and</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.159" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">the improvement</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.120" end="01:17:46.159" style="s2">of behavior and so that that that has</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">all been</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.159" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">uh i think tremendously uh fruitful and</p>
