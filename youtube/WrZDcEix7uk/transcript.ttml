<p begin="00:00:01.720" end="00:00:03.720" style="s2">Hello everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.909" end="00:00:08.848" style="s2"> Today is January 15. A few weeks ago, in a conversation with Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:13.139" style="s2"> I announced that I would close my Patreon account today,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:17.459" style="s2"> so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing, and Dave is or will be soon.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.850" end="00:00:21.239" style="s2"> I&#39;m not happy about this at all,</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.670" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2"> Patreon’s innovative service helped me a lot when I first got into trouble for the video</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:29.909" style="s2"> in which I criticized the Canadian Bill C-16</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.429" end="00:00:35.218" style="s2"> on forced speech and compulsory impartiality training policy at the University of Toronto,</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.670" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2"> but I think Patreon did not do the right thing in the case of Sargon of Akkad,</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.220" end="00:00:45.060" style="s2"> Carl Benjamin, and I think that sets a bad precedent.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.120" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2"> That&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.270" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2"> I am actively working on an alternative platform that will compete with Patreon. In the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.480" end="00:01:03.299" style="s2"> i set up a simple alternative without much functionality which is now in the lower left corner of my videos.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2"> This is for those who would like to continue me or just start supporting me.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.060" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2"> My financial situation has stabilized significantly since I originally made an order on Patreon, and I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.460" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2"> did in March 2016 to see if I could fund the further development of this Youtube channel on which I do not post and have never placed commercials.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.530" end="00:01:27.850" style="s2"> However,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.850" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2"> it seems that a significant number of people want to show and provide support on a regular basis,</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.140" end="00:01:41.279" style="s2"> desiring to give me something in return, for the content provided,</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.070" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2"> although I would probably continue to create video content anyway. See all that support</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.630" end="00:01:54.449" style="s2"> it definitely encourages me to put YouTube content creation at the top of my priority list,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.700" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2"> and also allows me to continue funding my small team working on an educational online project.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:04.319" style="s2"> I’ve said something about it in various past interviews.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.500" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2"> About 5,000 of my patrons have already left the platform in protest</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.580" style="s2"> so I dropped to about half the total number of patrons I once had.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:20.609" style="s2"> About 2,500 of them shifted their support to the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:26.880" style="s2"> which I mentioned earlier, and an unknown percentage of these 2,500 people are new.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.120" end="00:02:29.499" style="s2"> Thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.499" end="00:02:30.120" style="s2"> to all mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.190" end="00:02:36.479" style="s2"> patrons and viewers and listeners and readers for past support, and all those who have redirected</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.700" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2"> their contributions to the alternative system.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.310" end="00:02:42.210" style="s2"> Well, let&#39;s see how this goes.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:51.839" style="s2"> I think I&#39;ve prepared everything here to delete it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.930" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2"> Well, let&#39;s go.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.470" end="00:03:09.970" style="s2"> Okay, I have to withdraw $ 11 and 21 cents.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:17.829" style="s2"> That seems to have happened. Let&#39;s see if I can do this now.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.740" end="00:03:26.180" style="s2"> Another step seems.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:44.780" style="s2"> That&#39;s it, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s night in Switzerland right now where I&#39;m,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:58.309" style="s2"> and I tried to log in and it was definitely deleted, I wanted to let you know.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:00.330" style="s2"> Thanks again.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.330" end="00:04:05.779" style="s2"> See you soon, I have a few new YouTube videos to post next week</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.440" end="00:04:13.020" style="s2"> and I will see those coming to my presentations in California, New Zealand and Australia over the next month.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.020" end="00:04:14.380" style="s2"> Hi everyone.</p>
