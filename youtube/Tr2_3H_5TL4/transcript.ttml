<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">guess first of all I I grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">really rural area of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">and in Vermont and I grew up in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">an alternative community it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">intentional community but it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">close-knit community um sort of full of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">artists and poets my mother is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">musician and a poet my father is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">philosopher and a philosophy professor</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">and both my parents were you know my</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">father when we were growing up was part</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">of the mythopoetic men&#39;s movement so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:39.720" style="s2">know I was studying with people like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">Michael Mead and and Martine prep Dahl</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">was sort of active in our community</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">doing youth initiations and so I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:53.270" style="s2">and there was just group of yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">close-knit community of these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.270" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">mythopoetic types doing theatre in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.850" style="s2">woods and storytelling and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:07.009" style="s2">having bonfires late into the evening</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.850" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">and so I grew up in that sort of context</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.009" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">and then when my parents got divorced my</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">mother my brother and sister and I moved</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.610" style="s2">to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:18.099" style="s2">were all part of Vermont I mean who ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:21.400" style="s2">lived before was rural as well but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.099" end="00:02:23.290" style="s2">moved completely off the grid so like we</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:26.620" style="s2">restored an old farmhouse at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.290" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">a dirt road and moved to a community</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.620" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">where that was setting up a small</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">Steiner school so it was maybe 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:36.939" style="s2">families or something and so I also grew</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:41.709" style="s2">up very connected to sort of my Waldorf</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.939" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">Steiner community and so I spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.709" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">of time outdoors and in the woods and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:51.489" style="s2">and that I think that connection at an</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:53.889" style="s2">early age I mean of course then I went</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.489" end="00:02:57.069" style="s2">to school and went away to college and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.889" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">lost a lot of that but as I got closer</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.069" end="00:03:01.959" style="s2">to sort of going thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:03.909" style="s2">regeneration it was it was easier for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.959" end="00:03:06.129" style="s2">to get back to that place because I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.909" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">sort of the foundations in which I grew</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.129" end="00:03:13.769" style="s2">up were very connected to the outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">and yet at the same time I also sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.769" end="00:03:19.540" style="s2">when I was growing up it just considered</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">those topics another subject to study</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.540" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">right wasn&#39;t even though I was fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:29.709" style="s2">immersed in all of those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">inquiries into the mystic you know my</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.709" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">mother also it was part of a satsang a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:37.419" style="s2">community we lived near an ashram and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">yeah a community that practiced in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.419" end="00:03:42.549" style="s2">song tomate tradition which is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:46.389" style="s2">influenced by like in an Indian</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.549" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">spiritual movement that sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.389" end="00:03:52.150" style="s2">into being in the 13th century in India</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">and was very influenced by you know Sufi</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:59.229" style="s2">poets and other Indian mystical poets so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:02.199" style="s2">I was immersed in all of that but then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.229" end="00:04:04.359" style="s2">still had this sense of it was just</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.199" end="00:04:10.180" style="s2">another thing to study right just</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.359" end="00:04:13.180" style="s2">another topic and so in a way my journey</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:17.380" style="s2">has been to come full circle and realize</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.180" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just another topic to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.380" end="00:04:23.289" style="s2">study it&#39;s actually a deeper inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:26.740" style="s2">into what it means to be human on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.289" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">earth and and now that feels particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.740" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">irrelevant so anyway that was a long way</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">of saying that my childhood and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:35.500" style="s2">upbringing how to had a strong role to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:37.180" style="s2">play and me getting towards regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.500" end="00:04:40.569" style="s2">even though I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.180" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">interdisciplinary background and have</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.569" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">not studied science or anything that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:49.979" style="s2">full disclosure and probably one of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">less scholarly interviews interviewees a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.979" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">lot of studying in the last three years</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">just watching you talk to everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:01.630" style="s2">weaving into the common earth Network</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:04.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a couple of masters</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.630" end="00:05:06.669" style="s2">degrees right there the story you just</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.750" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">told like having a little daughter</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.669" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">myself at the moment I feel like what a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:13.509" style="s2">childhood I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t always easy</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:17.319" style="s2">and your parents separated it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.509" end="00:05:18.690" style="s2">difficult but that connection and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.319" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">think the point that you just made of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.690" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">that really this whole people need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:31.509" style="s2">get that it&#39;s about being and practicing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:33.789" style="s2">regeneration like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.509" end="00:05:35.590" style="s2">way of being as well as a way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.789" end="00:05:37.750" style="s2">and having had that foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.590" end="00:05:40.090" style="s2">actually living in community and living</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.750" end="00:05:43.719" style="s2">with connection to land and and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.090" end="00:05:45.460" style="s2">wider community of life in in that way I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.719" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">think is such an important foundation</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.460" end="00:05:51.820" style="s2">and also speaks to the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:54.729" style="s2">education in the long term creation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.820" end="00:06:00.759" style="s2">regenerative cultures and how did you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.729" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">get when so I know that you work in for</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.759" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">quite a long time with this organization</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:06.159" style="s2">a growing culture and helping like spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:07.449" style="s2">some time in Africa and all that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.159" end="00:06:11.009" style="s2">love to learn more about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.449" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2">organization and what you did there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.009" end="00:06:17.469" style="s2">yeah so I it was a very roundabout way</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:21.849" style="s2">of I I was an art history major in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.469" end="00:06:24.490" style="s2">college and worked in the arts arena for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.849" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">many years and then got really</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.490" end="00:06:30.250" style="s2">interested in library science actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:32.530" style="s2">and I have a Masters of Science in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:37.719" style="s2">information and library science and well</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:38.420" style="s2">I was in graduate school I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.719" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">there were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.420" end="00:06:42.980" style="s2">in the in the library science world</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:46.100" style="s2">there were two sort of key communities</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.980" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">one was sort of a traditional library</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.100" end="00:06:50.530" style="s2">community that was focused on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.960" end="00:06:54.530" style="s2">special collections and books and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.530" end="00:06:56.120" style="s2">museums and I had been very involved in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.530" end="00:06:57.320" style="s2">that community but when I got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.120" end="00:06:59.660" style="s2">libraries I realized that there was this</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.320" end="00:07:04.220" style="s2">other side of the community that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.660" end="00:07:07.130" style="s2">working around open access and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.220" end="00:07:09.590" style="s2">freely available government information</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.130" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">and public libraries because in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.590" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">United States public libraries have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:17.660" style="s2">incredible sort of history where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:20.390" style="s2">these spaces that provide free and open</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.660" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">access to anyone essentially and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.390" end="00:07:24.380" style="s2">they&#39;ve been yeah they were very</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:27.580" style="s2">involved in sort of the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.380" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">movement and so I got into activism in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.580" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">library school when I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:37.640" style="s2">training to be a library a librarian and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:40.700" style="s2">yeah and it was you know Aaron Swartz</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.640" end="00:07:42.470" style="s2">had committed suicide a few years before</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.700" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">I was in library school and that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.470" end="00:07:46.520" style="s2">still sort of really influencing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">affecting the library community he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.520" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">an open access activist sort of trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.920" style="s2">to break down the barriers to you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.240" end="00:07:57.560" style="s2">public access to information of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.920" end="00:07:59.690" style="s2">kinds because as we know so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.560" end="00:08:04.250" style="s2">information in the world is close behind</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.690" end="00:08:06.200" style="s2">peignoir barriers and so forth and so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.250" end="00:08:08.120" style="s2">got into this sort of activist community</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.200" end="00:08:14.180" style="s2">and started to move away from the arts</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.120" end="00:08:16.340" style="s2">and I yeah I got a full-time unpaid</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.180" end="00:08:18.110" style="s2">internship at the United Nations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.340" end="00:08:20.420" style="s2">really studied sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.110" end="00:08:21.920" style="s2">information access channels and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.420" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">distributing information through</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.920" end="00:08:30.650" style="s2">intergovernmental sorts of bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:33.380" style="s2">then at that time I reconnected with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.650" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">old friend Lauren Carelli who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.380" end="00:08:37.400" style="s2">president and founder of a growing</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.040" style="s2">culture and he and I actually grew up</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.400" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">together in Vermont so it was we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.040" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">longtime friends and since I was in sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:49.000" style="s2">of the open access</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:54.220" style="s2">you know internet hacking sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.000" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">library side of activism Lauren got</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.220" end="00:08:58.090" style="s2">really interested in that because one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:01.800" style="s2">the things that he was working on was</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.090" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">how to sort of make the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.800" end="00:09:07.480" style="s2">agricultural complex obsolete in that he</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:10.030" style="s2">was he&#39;s really focused on supporting</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.480" end="00:09:13.180" style="s2">small holder farmers and their role in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.030" end="00:09:15.130" style="s2">the food system and their role in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.180" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">addressing so many of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.130" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">interconnected challenges that we face</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">globally and he wanted to this was in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:28.300" style="s2">2015 he wanted to create some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:31.180" style="s2">platform or some sort of database where</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.300" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">we could like store and make freely</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.180" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">accessible all of these grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.630" end="00:09:39.010" style="s2">agro-ecological innovations that were</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:40.810" style="s2">coming from farming communities all over</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">the world but especially in the global</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.810" end="00:09:46.090" style="s2">south where a growing culture was more</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">focused although now they&#39;re doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.090" end="00:09:55.900" style="s2">of work in the US but and so Lauren and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:59.010" style="s2">I partnered up together to work on what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.900" end="00:10:02.770" style="s2">became the library for food sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.010" end="00:10:07.020" style="s2">right now and Association we we all need</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.770" end="00:10:10.330" style="s2">to look at that library yeah yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.020" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">and you know of course we we started off</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.330" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">with this idea that would be a platform</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:16.570" style="s2">and it would it would be high tech and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:18.339" style="s2">accessible to everyone and quickly we</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.570" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">got into this process and realized like</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.339" end="00:10:23.320" style="s2">that if our main users were farmers in</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:25.750" style="s2">the global South like they were not</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.320" end="00:10:27.430" style="s2">going to use this platform so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.750" end="00:10:29.860" style="s2">realized right away that it had to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.430" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">much more than a platform like this was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.860" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">about tapping into a community and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">this library was going to be offline and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:42.040" style="s2">online it was going to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:45.310" style="s2">transcending many different spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.040" end="00:10:47.710" style="s2">communities and that very importantly it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.310" end="00:10:51.970" style="s2">wasn&#39;t sort of this closed database or</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.710" end="00:10:54.520" style="s2">like archival repository of documents or</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">something like that it was this living</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.520" end="00:11:02.110" style="s2">and breathing sort of yeah this river of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:04.600" style="s2">all sorts of to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.110" end="00:11:06.579" style="s2">and agro ecological innovations from</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.600" end="00:11:10.870" style="s2">communities all over the world I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.579" end="00:11:15.579" style="s2">that is a huge lesson and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.870" end="00:11:18.070" style="s2">almost message in that story and that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.579" end="00:11:20.829" style="s2">sit with a lot at the moment when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.070" end="00:11:24.700" style="s2">watch all these wonderful attempts in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.829" end="00:11:28.600" style="s2">the kind of regeneration of landscape</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.700" end="00:11:31.720" style="s2">space where people are building all</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.600" end="00:11:35.050" style="s2">these mechanisms for monitoring the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.720" end="00:11:38.440" style="s2">impact of like the regenerative impact</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.050" end="00:11:40.990" style="s2">on a piece of land and to help farmers</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.440" end="00:11:43.149" style="s2">maybe earn twice not just for their</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.990" end="00:11:45.160" style="s2">produce but for the positive impact on</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.149" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">healing the landscape and the carbon</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">drawdown in the regeneration effect none</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:53.320" style="s2">of it is wonderful and I&#39;m glad all this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:55.390" style="s2">work is being done but but lately I keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.320" end="00:11:57.579" style="s2">asking myself if we keep doing that all</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.390" end="00:12:00.700" style="s2">these the kind of resource economy</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.579" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">people who love the sort of much at</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.700" end="00:12:07.959" style="s2">Fresno and Venus Project ilk am I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">concerned about in the best of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.959" end="00:12:12.070" style="s2">intentions by putting everything on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:14.140" style="s2">platform that is ultimately digitally</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.070" end="00:12:14.440" style="s2">digital and you have to have a mobile</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.140" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">phone</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.440" end="00:12:21.880" style="s2">or you have to be in that game of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:23.740" style="s2">virtually connected in order to UM to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.880" end="00:12:29.030" style="s2">even engage with this well-meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.740" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">system how we cut out or how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.030" end="00:12:34.640" style="s2">technologically technologically colonia</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">lies people who might have actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.640" end="00:12:40.250" style="s2">right to choose that they would like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">be smallholder farmers in their</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.250" end="00:12:47.060" style="s2">community living in the ways that their</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:49.340" style="s2">traditions have taught them and not</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.060" end="00:12:50.960" style="s2">engaged with those technologies where do</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.340" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">you sit on that double-edged sword of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.960" end="00:12:56.750" style="s2">Technology oh yeah I mean I&#39;m not after</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:13:00.260" style="s2">trying to build this platform for</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.750" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">several years I you know don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.260" end="00:13:07.520" style="s2">much I believe in platforms anymore</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">and yet yeah I mean I think that the big</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.520" end="00:13:11.540" style="s2">realization is is that you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:13.460" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re working on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.540" end="00:13:14.960" style="s2">platform you&#39;re not just working on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.460" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">platform you&#39;re working on something</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.960" end="00:13:20.330" style="s2">much larger and if you can keep that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">sort of big picture in your mind then</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.330" end="00:13:27.220" style="s2">the platform aspect becomes just one</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:30.650" style="s2">tool in a larger sort of toolkit to use</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:32.570" style="s2">so it&#39;s not this like end-all like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.650" end="00:13:35.000" style="s2">creating this this is the solution this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.570" end="00:13:39.140" style="s2">is going to do it all it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.000" end="00:13:43.100" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s explore and improve our</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.140" end="00:13:45.770" style="s2">skills at creating tools and toolkits</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.100" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">that can support in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.770" end="00:13:50.960" style="s2">different ways but that importantly are</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:53.390" style="s2">keeping that big picture in mind and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.960" end="00:13:55.580" style="s2">this is like it seems really simple like</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.390" end="00:13:57.200" style="s2">keep the big picture in mind but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.580" end="00:14:00.170" style="s2">actually really rare that people do</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.200" end="00:14:03.320" style="s2">because everyone gets focused on their</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.170" end="00:14:08.390" style="s2">one role and the work oftentimes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.320" end="00:14:11.510" style="s2">becomes about improving and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.390" end="00:14:13.520" style="s2">building that one role instead of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.510" end="00:14:16.520" style="s2">flipping it around and saying how is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.520" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">this I&#39;m not I&#39;m not against expertise</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.520" end="00:14:19.550" style="s2">but like how is my expertise serving</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:22.540" style="s2">something greater</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.550" end="00:14:26.020" style="s2">how is my sort of piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.540" end="00:14:27.830" style="s2">uplifting the entire the entire sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.020" end="00:14:32.300" style="s2">transformational journey that were on</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.830" end="00:14:34.010" style="s2">and with with the growing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.300" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">particularly in the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.010" end="00:14:37.640" style="s2">seeing all these wonderful people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:42.170" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to bring together and come</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.640" end="00:14:42.740" style="s2">on earth all having this on the ones and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.170" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.740" end="00:14:46.670" style="s2">standing like if you build an</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:48.920" style="s2">organization like drawdown or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.670" end="00:14:52.040" style="s2">biomimicry Institute or ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.920" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">restoration camps or common land and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.040" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">you know that they it&#39;s doing good work</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:57.170" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re amazing people</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:14:58.760" style="s2">working in it that you care about</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">because you&#39;ve met their families and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.760" end="00:15:04.640" style="s2">you want to keep them also in the job</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">and then it becomes understandable that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.640" end="00:15:09.500" style="s2">it becomes difficult to collaborate in</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:12.380" style="s2">that larger beyond the organization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.500" end="00:15:14.570" style="s2">actual work because people have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.380" end="00:15:16.700" style="s2">sort of dual allegiance of yes wanting</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.570" end="00:15:18.440" style="s2">to do the work but also not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.700" end="00:15:23.959" style="s2">jeopardize the work they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.440" end="00:15:27.080" style="s2">doing and a lot yeah and it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.959" end="00:15:29.390" style="s2">not like I don&#39;t experience that either</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.080" end="00:15:33.260" style="s2">you know we all experience that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.390" end="00:15:35.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s like sort of like we want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.260" end="00:15:38.209" style="s2">do good work but first we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.240" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">care of ourselves right and I don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.209" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to get around that um</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:47.899" style="s2">you know I have and then in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:53.180" style="s2">ways it&#39;s depressing because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.899" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">so much there aren&#39;t so there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.180" end="00:15:57.380" style="s2">social scaffolding or infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">that allows that uplifts and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.380" end="00:16:02.750" style="s2">supports the transformation that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:04.760" style="s2">really needed and we&#39;re all sort of we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.750" end="00:16:06.470" style="s2">have like good ideas in our head and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.760" end="00:16:09.589" style="s2">like the content of what we&#39;re promoting</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.470" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">is incredible and yet we&#39;re stuck inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.589" end="00:16:15.560" style="s2">of old business models and nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:17.630" style="s2">structures and we&#39;re really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.560" end="00:16:19.250" style="s2">make this leap to something that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.630" end="00:16:21.950" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t even know what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.250" end="00:16:23.779" style="s2">a lot of times I find these structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.950" end="00:16:25.760" style="s2">are holding us back and I&#39;m also not</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.779" end="00:16:27.589" style="s2">saying like that structures aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.760" end="00:16:29.870" style="s2">useful I I think institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.589" end="00:16:32.779" style="s2">organizations are useful in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.870" end="00:16:35.930" style="s2">but in other cases they can it can hold</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.779" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">you back um I just wanted to come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.930" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">briefly because the the what we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:42.740" style="s2">talking about earlier with the platform</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.760" end="00:16:44.899" style="s2">because it reminded me yesterday I had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:47.899" style="s2">conversation with Martin fan Hildebrandt</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.899" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2">from guy Amazonas and and he told the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.899" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">story of how they&#39;ve been helping in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.550" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">Colombia to protect and lots of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">over a million hectares actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.890" end="00:17:01.650" style="s2">the white attire is 16 million hectares</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.110" end="00:17:03.810" style="s2">of Amazonian rainforest and for me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.650" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">the Jeunesse tribes that live in in them</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.810" end="00:17:08.580" style="s2">and have over years fought for the land</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">rights for these people so they actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.580" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">own the the right to their territory and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:24.420" style="s2">um in his work or their work with their</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.390" end="00:17:26.310" style="s2">wisdom systems of forest management by</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.420" end="00:17:29.640" style="s2">living in the forest as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.310" end="00:17:33.990" style="s2">forest and and the whole framework like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.640" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">he was describing that there and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.990" end="00:17:42.360" style="s2">still have this richness of the spirits</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">and the totems and the certain areas of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.360" end="00:17:47.100" style="s2">the forest just being taboo for certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:48.840" style="s2">time times of the year and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.100" end="00:17:50.670" style="s2">of the spirits but it also when you look</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">at it from a biological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.670" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">it&#39;s because there&#39;s some important</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:56.670" style="s2">reproduction process or growth process</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">going on so the it&#39;s best not to go into</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.670" end="00:18:00.600" style="s2">that part of the forest but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:04.170" style="s2">told in different stories that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.600" end="00:18:05.880" style="s2">just the Western rational story and well</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.170" end="00:18:06.900" style="s2">I found interesting about it was that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.880" end="00:18:08.460" style="s2">because we are talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.900" end="00:18:10.050" style="s2">double-edged sword of Technology in</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.460" end="00:18:11.700" style="s2">these paradoxes and dilemmas we</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.050" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">constantly have to navigate between will</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.700" end="00:18:17.700" style="s2">have to embrace and he was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">the elders were worried that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.700" end="00:18:21.800" style="s2">this knowledge was being lost because</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:25.020" style="s2">when they were putting on three-day</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.800" end="00:18:26.460" style="s2">ceremonies the youngsters after a day</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.020" end="00:18:28.440" style="s2">and a half were like ok how much longer</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.460" end="00:18:31.290" style="s2">is this going to go on and and can I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.440" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">something else now and and so the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.290" end="00:18:36.390" style="s2">that they began to actually engage the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">youngsters and rebuild the pride in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.390" end="00:18:40.650" style="s2">connection with that long lineage and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:44.040" style="s2">storyline was to start using some</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.650" end="00:18:46.650" style="s2">technologies so they let them make</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.040" end="00:18:48.750" style="s2">little videos about the stories and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.650" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">and find new ways of capturing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.750" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">knowledge in that modern technology way</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">and while on the one hand it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:18:57.480" style="s2">wince on the other hand I can see well</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:18:59.850" style="s2">if that&#39;s that&#39;s how you make the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.480" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">between and and engage the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.850" end="00:19:05.400" style="s2">generation in the value of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:09.420" style="s2">knowledge fantastic yeah I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.400" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">yeah I totally agree I think like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.420" end="00:19:17.700" style="s2">the objective should not be to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:20.190" style="s2">like you know go back to some ancient</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.700" end="00:19:23.340" style="s2">way of living but we have to learn to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:27.180" style="s2">sort of of those ways in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.340" end="00:19:29.430" style="s2">like we need to reposition an orient our</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.180" end="00:19:33.540" style="s2">technologies towards something greater</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.430" end="00:19:35.790" style="s2">we need to we need to yeah I think live</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.540" end="00:19:40.460" style="s2">in relationship with our ancestry and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.790" end="00:19:44.250" style="s2">what&#39;s come for us and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.460" end="00:19:47.850" style="s2">use our technologies as tools to extend</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.250" end="00:19:49.910" style="s2">and sort of evolve those relationships</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.850" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2">and new ways the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.910" end="00:19:57.930" style="s2">technology often comes in and is is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.940" end="00:20:01.320" style="s2">in tune with those elements right it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.930" end="00:20:04.530" style="s2">comes in and it&#39;s it&#39;s technology for</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.320" end="00:20:07.770" style="s2">technology&#39;s sake or its you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.530" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">part of that never-ending growth sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.770" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">system and so it&#39;s not that technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:19.850" style="s2">is the problem it&#39;s that it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:23.040" style="s2">used in service of something meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.850" end="00:20:24.660" style="s2">so I think that they&#39;re almost two</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.040" end="00:20:28.170" style="s2">layers to that I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.660" end="00:20:30.110" style="s2">what you just said I feel like even when</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.170" end="00:20:34.050" style="s2">you get to the layer of being very</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.110" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">cautious and conscious of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.050" end="00:20:40.860" style="s2">still possible that underneath there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:42.900" style="s2">yet one more layer where like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.860" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">say comes more from from what what Bucky</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.900" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">Fuller&#39;s advice and if you if you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">to change the way people think don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.670" style="s2">tell them what to think of them the tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.770" style="s2">the use of which will change how they</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.670" end="00:20:55.410" style="s2">think and I think that with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.770" end="00:20:57.870" style="s2">technologies were using even if we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.410" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">using them with the best of intention</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.870" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">for a greater good the tool itself still</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:08.340" style="s2">has a power of re orientating how we</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:11.550" style="s2">like what we look at how we look at it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.340" end="00:21:13.530" style="s2">what data we see valuable how it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.550" end="00:21:16.380" style="s2">processed how we engage with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.530" end="00:21:18.930" style="s2">situation and that&#39;s almost the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.380" end="00:21:21.059" style="s2">insidious kind of colonialization of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.930" end="00:21:26.039" style="s2">mind through technology where</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.059" end="00:21:30.179" style="s2">and it really takes the practice to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.039" end="00:21:34.409" style="s2">discern how much we all are influenced</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.179" end="00:21:38.519" style="s2">by that yeah I mean I&#39;m reminded of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.409" end="00:21:42.179" style="s2">know like sometimes there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.519" end="00:21:44.879" style="s2">like you know capitalism capitalism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.179" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">me you know extractive never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.879" end="00:21:50.279" style="s2">growth sort of economic system is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">some sort of conspiracy theory or</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.279" end="00:21:54.629" style="s2">something to fight when really it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.980" end="00:21:57.899" style="s2">of like worse than that it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.629" end="00:21:59.730" style="s2">logic of a system that&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.899" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">the greatest artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.730" end="00:22:04.619" style="s2">that&#39;s ever been created right and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:06.210" style="s2">we don&#39;t even we don&#39;t even really see</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.619" end="00:22:09.809" style="s2">it it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the air we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.210" end="00:22:15.019" style="s2">breathe right and so I&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.809" end="00:22:18.809" style="s2">that sort of idea and that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.019" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">yeah how that how that technology is in</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.809" end="00:22:23.190" style="s2">relation you know is you know in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.210" end="00:22:25.169" style="s2">relationship with our yeah with our</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.190" end="00:22:26.389" style="s2">minds and how we how are being</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.169" end="00:22:32.730" style="s2">influenced by it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.389" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">lately I&#39;ve come to a couple of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.730" end="00:22:44.070" style="s2">very basic insights like they&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">so basic that do you feel and with</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:47.460" style="s2">regard to our the whole capitalism store</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:48.299" style="s2">because it&#39;s the we&#39;ve had this</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.299" end="00:22:55.289" style="s2">again this attempt of how do we</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.379" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">the understanding so things get better</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.570" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a well-meaning attempt</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:17.519" style="s2">but with all these people working on</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:20.700" style="s2">social capital and natural capital and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.519" end="00:23:22.730" style="s2">all that it&#39;s it&#39;s also in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.700" end="00:23:25.769" style="s2">becoming a mechanism that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.730" end="00:23:28.950" style="s2">monetizes them social relationships and</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.950" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">like it could so easily again in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.860" end="00:23:36.210" style="s2">constructing these systems that a soup</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.990" end="00:23:48.120" style="s2">danger is that the minute we invent the</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.120" end="00:23:54.600" style="s2">capitals into economic capital we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.350" end="00:23:58.740" style="s2">and-and-and deep wisdom to land in that</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.740" end="00:24:03.990" style="s2">and-and-and what the baseline of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.519" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">you are just saying that that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.990" end="00:24:08.730" style="s2">really understand that it&#39;s the air we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:09.929" style="s2">breathe is that simple understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.730" end="00:24:11.909" style="s2">that there&#39;s the difference between our</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.929" end="00:24:13.970" style="s2">culture and all native peoples</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.909" end="00:24:17.549" style="s2">everywhere in the world is that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.970" end="00:24:20.899" style="s2">believed that land can belong to us and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.549" end="00:24:26.370" style="s2">they know that we belong to the land</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.899" end="00:24:29.009" style="s2">yeah yes really providing that found and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.370" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">and to extend that a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.009" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">I mean I couldn&#39;t agree more I&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:39.659" style="s2">come to also have this really simple yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:42.450" style="s2">profound understanding of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.659" end="00:24:44.100" style="s2">I do and the work that we do a common I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.450" end="00:24:46.830" style="s2">think loud burst and that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.100" end="00:24:48.600" style="s2">real work is working on each other what</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.830" end="00:24:51.299" style="s2">you may think we are doing a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.600" end="00:24:53.759" style="s2">regenerative roadmap for New Zealand or</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.299" end="00:24:57.690" style="s2">Costa Rica but really we are working on</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.759" end="00:24:59.909" style="s2">each other and we are we are learning we</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.690" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">are in developmental learning</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.909" end="00:25:05.669" style="s2">relationships with each other and when</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:08.549" style="s2">all is said and done that those are</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.669" end="00:25:11.759" style="s2">going to be the most transformative</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.549" end="00:25:14.009" style="s2">aspects and it in the sense that then</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.759" end="00:25:18.690" style="s2">the rest will come from that and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.009" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">and this is why I I tend to with with</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.690" end="00:25:23.370" style="s2">colleagues and like you know friends</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:25.799" style="s2">around the world I tend to focused first</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.370" end="00:25:28.470" style="s2">on a sense of solidarity with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.799" end="00:25:31.649" style="s2">person and then and then whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">will will come from that place rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.649" end="00:25:38.490" style="s2">than you know rushing into some work</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.830" end="00:25:40.830" style="s2">stream around some good idea without</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">having established that sort of base of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.830" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">trust and solidarity with the person</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:47.820" style="s2">because it&#39;s those it&#39;s when you rush</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.770" style="s2">into these sort of functional</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.820" end="00:25:53.180" style="s2">relationships around good ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.770" end="00:25:58.310" style="s2">there are so many good ideas right</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.180" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">without that connection and I though it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.310" end="00:26:03.660" style="s2">tends to not be as long-lasting and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:06.590" style="s2">transformative it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.660" end="00:26:10.170" style="s2">different way of working that first way</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.590" end="00:26:12.120" style="s2">needs mo use and contracts and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.170" end="00:26:15.510" style="s2">financial arrangements and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.120" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">the second way is a alignment of in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.510" end="00:26:21.090" style="s2">shared intention and and and building</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:23.430" style="s2">circles of trust that then and you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.090" end="00:26:26.280" style="s2">get burned with that tool we all know</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.430" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">that but but more often than not you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.280" end="00:26:31.770" style="s2">don&#39;t get burned and it and it creates</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:35.820" style="s2">an agile way of working that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.770" end="00:26:37.290" style="s2">need all this and yeah fluff around that</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.820" end="00:26:40.500" style="s2">takes so much energy and so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.290" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">resources and my point is the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.500" end="00:26:44.850" style="s2">deep the the impulse in the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.040" style="s2">and again it&#39;s I mean I could add</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.850" end="00:26:49.380" style="s2">disclosure after disclosure but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.040" end="00:26:51.510" style="s2">to say that mo use aren&#39;t useful or that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.380" end="00:26:54.420" style="s2">you know strategy and how strategic</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.510" end="00:27:00.050" style="s2">plans aren&#39;t useful it&#39;s just to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.420" end="00:27:03.660" style="s2">that if you if you first focus on</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.050" end="00:27:05.880" style="s2">establishing a rich culture where people</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.660" end="00:27:09.060" style="s2">are there because there is a profound</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.880" end="00:27:10.560" style="s2">exchange of value and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.060" end="00:27:12.060" style="s2">they&#39;re not there because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.560" end="00:27:15.960" style="s2">getting funded to be there or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.060" end="00:27:19.110" style="s2">not there because of some vanity play</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.960" end="00:27:21.150" style="s2">they&#39;re there because they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:24.090" style="s2">and because they feel a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.150" end="00:27:26.150" style="s2">solidarity with with what you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.090" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">on between and what they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.150" end="00:27:34.230" style="s2">and then from that you know funding can</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:36.210" style="s2">if you first established that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.230" end="00:27:39.060" style="s2">getting some funding will really go a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.210" end="00:27:44.040" style="s2">long way or you know signing that MOU</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.060" end="00:27:45.780" style="s2">will be much more impactful at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.040" end="00:27:47.430" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve found and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.780" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">brings us right into common earth and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.430" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">common earth alliance because you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:58.020" style="s2">rulla rulla and Secretary General</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:01.410" style="s2">Patricia scotland&#39;s they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.020" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">convening regularly since 2016 at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.410" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">as you know and at our last convening in</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:10.860" style="s2">October of 2019 Rolla and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:12.690" style="s2">that that we could and we should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.860" end="00:28:14.460" style="s2">doing more than just convening there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:17.400" style="s2">actually this opportunity to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.460" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">harness our operationalized a larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.400" end="00:28:22.950" style="s2">movement of a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:24.800" style="s2">organizations and initiatives and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.950" end="00:28:29.370" style="s2">individuals that were working in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.800" end="00:28:31.350" style="s2">regenerative space and so since then</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:34.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve been working on evolving this</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.350" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">common Earth Alliance concept and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.950" end="00:28:41.340" style="s2">very we&#39;re sort of building it as we go</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s it feels like it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.340" end="00:28:48.200" style="s2">momentum even though there are no formal</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:51.330" style="s2">agreements there is no funding in place</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.200" end="00:28:53.660" style="s2">but what we&#39;ve been able to do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.330" end="00:28:56.850" style="s2">establish that sense of solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.660" end="00:28:58.170" style="s2">establish that sense of trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.850" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">people are coming because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.170" end="00:29:02.040" style="s2">learning an enormous amount from each</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">other and they love the dialogues that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.040" end="00:29:08.340" style="s2">are taking place and I feel like to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:10.950" style="s2">that as a foundation and again it takes</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.340" end="00:29:12.930" style="s2">time it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just like you set</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:14.850" style="s2">it up in a week or you design it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.930" end="00:29:21.870" style="s2">then you implement it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.850" end="00:29:24.660" style="s2">ongoing process that that the prep that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.870" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">you and you have to prioritize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.660" end="00:29:32.310" style="s2">culture that you are cultivating that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">the priority and that&#39;s the key it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.310" end="00:29:37.110" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:41.670" style="s2">I completely agree and um having been</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:43.740" style="s2">involved in in in varying degrees like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.670" end="00:29:47.820" style="s2">we did much more in the first meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.740" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">October 2016 and then less so and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.820" end="00:29:53.700" style="s2">of a kind of listening and feedback in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:58.530" style="s2">little bit of visor II roles since then</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.700" end="00:30:00.630" style="s2">um I&#39;ve been more and more in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.530" end="00:30:03.270" style="s2">opportunities to have these learning</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.630" end="00:30:05.460" style="s2">conversations around a wonderful project</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.270" end="00:30:09.870" style="s2">that is really worth doing with amazing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.460" end="00:30:10.990" style="s2">people and but we we very often want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.870" end="00:30:14.200" style="s2">create</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.200" end="00:30:18.860" style="s2">contributions and very often you hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.700" end="00:30:21.380" style="s2">the voice why aren&#39;t there more young</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.860" end="00:30:23.929" style="s2">people around this table or where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.380" end="00:30:26.360" style="s2">where&#39;s the global self representation</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.929" end="00:30:29.990" style="s2">always the real grassroots present</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:32.600" style="s2">representation and that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.990" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">shadow side of what you said nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.600" end="00:30:37.370" style="s2">around the table because there&#39;s funding</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.330" end="00:30:39.710" style="s2">or they get there only there to learn</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.370" end="00:30:42.620" style="s2">there is a certain privilege of being</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:44.690" style="s2">either through trajectory in life stage</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.620" end="00:30:47.539" style="s2">like where you&#39;re at in your life in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.690" end="00:30:50.299" style="s2">situation of being able to dedicate X</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.539" end="00:30:53.900" style="s2">amount of time to that kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.299" end="00:30:57.020" style="s2">or non-income-generating collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.900" end="00:30:58.400" style="s2">but what it often does is either really</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.020" end="00:31:00.620" style="s2">committed people that have spent all</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.400" end="00:31:02.150" style="s2">their life working for grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.620" end="00:31:05.210" style="s2">organizations and haven&#39;t built up any</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.150" end="00:31:07.580" style="s2">resources to coast on to make time for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.210" end="00:31:09.260" style="s2">those kind of things or young people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.580" end="00:31:12.620" style="s2">are still not in the process of having</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.260" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">established a way of earning an income</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.620" end="00:31:16.340" style="s2">that then freeze them for these</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.770" style="s2">processes they can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.340" end="00:31:20.570" style="s2">time-consuming and because they are deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.770" end="00:31:24.020" style="s2">learning journeys with a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.570" end="00:31:26.770" style="s2">community and there&#39;s so worth it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.020" end="00:31:30.409" style="s2">but what I&#39;m but I&#39;m getting it is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.770" end="00:31:32.600" style="s2">without intending to do so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.409" end="00:31:35.299" style="s2">little bit of selection of a group that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.600" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">can do this and and there are some</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.299" end="00:31:39.020" style="s2">people on the fringe that should be in</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:42.770" style="s2">the conversation that there are in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.020" end="00:31:44.600" style="s2">tension of between serving self and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.770" end="00:31:47.809" style="s2">their family and serving the larger</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.600" end="00:31:50.419" style="s2">whole that they are also part of of not</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.809" end="00:31:52.520" style="s2">being able to engage in the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.419" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">have you noticed that with what some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.520" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">the people that you would have liked to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:58.970" style="s2">have involved yeah absolutely yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:08.470" style="s2">everyone can be involved in the process</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.970" end="00:32:12.669" style="s2">like this and yet I I have over time</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.470" end="00:32:16.730" style="s2">gotten used to and have some peace with</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.669" end="00:32:17.809" style="s2">the reality that nothing we do will ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.730" end="00:32:23.049" style="s2">be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.809" end="00:32:23.049" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.320" end="00:32:28.669" style="s2">another deep wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">yeah and that and that actually this</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.669" end="00:32:35.960" style="s2">impulse to try to make it perfect to try</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:39.250" style="s2">to craft the perfect jewel of equality</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.960" end="00:32:45.019" style="s2">and the sort of like intellectual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.250" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">gem of a project or an initiative to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.019" end="00:32:53.899" style="s2">focus on that is to miss the point and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:58.909" style="s2">and also to focus on that is in a way to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.899" end="00:33:00.409" style="s2">UM at least I found in my subjective</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.909" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">experience of working on the common</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.409" end="00:33:06.830" style="s2">earth is to actually move into a place</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">in the future or in a place in the past</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.830" end="00:33:14.750" style="s2">and not be present in the context</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:16.279" style="s2">context that we are in right so we you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.750" end="00:33:18.529" style="s2">know and the regenerative movement we</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.279" end="00:33:21.860" style="s2">always talk about place source potential</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.529" end="00:33:25.309" style="s2">and context and how our efforts need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.860" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">be site-specific and rooted in community</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.309" end="00:33:33.019" style="s2">and and that&#39;s not to say that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:35.090" style="s2">at times break down those silos of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.019" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">comfort zone in your community and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.090" end="00:33:43.179" style="s2">search for new inspiration and new</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:48.139" style="s2">perspectives but what I&#39;ve found is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.179" end="00:33:49.789" style="s2">yeah trying to get out of thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.139" end="00:33:52.519" style="s2">the past or thinking in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.789" end="00:33:55.690" style="s2">really presencing what is available to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.519" end="00:33:58.519" style="s2">us you know because there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.690" end="00:34:00.590" style="s2">dimensions to a project or an</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.519" end="00:34:03.529" style="s2">organization right that aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.590" end="00:34:06.500" style="s2">about the idea right that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.529" end="00:34:08.510" style="s2">like sometimes that&#39;s sort of like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:11.030" style="s2">everyone sort of congregates around is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:14.089" style="s2">the idea or the vision the mission the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.030" end="00:34:16.609" style="s2">potential and yet there are operations</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.089" end="00:34:18.980" style="s2">there&#39;s funding there&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.609" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">dynamics power structures inherent in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.980" end="00:34:26.570" style="s2">every single effort that we do and to to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:30.020" style="s2">sort of tense and shut those out and try</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.570" end="00:34:33.319" style="s2">to make it perfect is to in a way not</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.020" end="00:34:36.050" style="s2">tap into the true essence of what that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.319" end="00:34:40.470" style="s2">thing wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.050" end="00:34:42.200" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;ve I resist the impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:44.849" style="s2">tried to make common earth this</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.200" end="00:34:46.470" style="s2">catch-all for everything like as if as</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.849" end="00:34:49.109" style="s2">if we had to do it all in this one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.470" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">project it had to be the perfect project</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.109" end="00:34:53.580" style="s2">you know ticking off all of the criteria</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:57.869" style="s2">of what a regenerative initiative would</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.580" end="00:35:00.359" style="s2">be when it&#39;s not possible because we to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.869" end="00:35:02.940" style="s2">work regenerative ly is to reach for</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.359" end="00:35:07.109" style="s2">something that wants to be born that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a process and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.109" end="00:35:11.340" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t just reach for it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.780" end="00:35:13.260" style="s2">have it be this perfect jewel and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.340" end="00:35:15.960" style="s2">now you do regenerative development</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.260" end="00:35:18.140" style="s2">right it you have to present you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:21.270" style="s2">tap into the unique potential of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.140" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">community you&#39;re in and so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.270" end="00:35:27.950" style="s2">of what we&#39;ve been focusing on initially</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:31.980" style="s2">intuitively and now with some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.950" end="00:35:35.030" style="s2">intention that speaks very strongly to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.980" end="00:35:37.500" style="s2">another one of the profound simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.030" end="00:35:42.089" style="s2">insights that I&#39;m coming back to more</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.500" end="00:35:44.609" style="s2">and more is how insidious I got four</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.089" end="00:35:46.680" style="s2">years I mean probably I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.609" end="00:35:48.599" style="s2">time I wrote that sentence was in 2002</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.680" end="00:35:51.660" style="s2">in my master&#39;s thesis at Truman college</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.599" end="00:35:53.910" style="s2">and that sustainability isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.660" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">endpoint that we can ever arrive at but</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.910" end="00:35:58.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a learning journey in community of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">how to participate appropriately in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.440" end="00:36:06.330" style="s2">nested complexity and and yet while I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.220" style="s2">rewritten that same statement in many</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.330" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2">ways and and and brought it into lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:15.540" style="s2">my teaching and so on em I still find</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">that sometimes I fall into the thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.540" end="00:36:20.369" style="s2">trap of spending time thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">some sort of perfect in state and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.369" end="00:36:25.050" style="s2">getting all the pieces of the puzzle in</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">place instead of really understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.050" end="00:36:31.020" style="s2">that that this is a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:32.040" style="s2">journey and it will never stop and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.020" end="00:36:34.290" style="s2">never get there</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.040" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">there is no end point that we can then</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.290" end="00:36:38.430" style="s2">down tools and say what a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:39.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve made it it&#39;s everything is</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.430" end="00:36:44.010" style="s2">hunky-dory because the world keeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.810" end="00:36:46.080" style="s2">transforming and and and once you really</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.010" end="00:36:52.830" style="s2">internalize that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.080" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">then a you can be easier on holding</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.830" end="00:36:57.420" style="s2">differences more likely and still move</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:37:00.350" style="s2">forward with with some shared intention</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.420" end="00:37:02.910" style="s2">even if one person is kind of a bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.350" end="00:37:04.650" style="s2">techie new green deal and the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.910" end="00:37:06.270" style="s2">person is a little bit no no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.650" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">get it it&#39;s all the wrong kind of green</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.270" end="00:37:10.040" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:16.430" style="s2">they&#39;re ultimately both people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.040" end="00:37:19.710" style="s2">people who want to serve positively</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.430" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">moving towards increased health and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.710" end="00:37:25.020" style="s2">wholeness and and they can in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:28.080" style="s2">journey have the conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.020" end="00:37:30.420" style="s2">where we arrive will be neither one nor</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.080" end="00:37:32.490" style="s2">the other future it will be who you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.420" end="00:37:35.120" style="s2">won&#39;t arrive we&#39;ll just continue to keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.490" end="00:37:39.030" style="s2">learning on the way yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.120" end="00:37:41.490" style="s2">regenerative development is not the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.030" end="00:37:45.180" style="s2">religion you know that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.490" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">the point is not to convince the smart</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.180" end="00:37:52.290" style="s2">AG or the you know yeah more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.430" style="s2">green tech a movement that regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.290" end="00:38:00.060" style="s2">development is what they should be</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.430" end="00:38:02.340" style="s2">working on as if it was a different just</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.060" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">another topic or just you know or the</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.480" end="00:38:21.840" style="s2">this work is being able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.210" end="00:38:24.900" style="s2">coexisting different perspectives at</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.840" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">once and just increasingly sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.900" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">increase my own capability as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:34.980" style="s2">activist to hold yeah coexisting and</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.980" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">of at once and give them a seat at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.860" end="00:38:43.260" style="s2">table almost in your in your thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:46.170" style="s2">process and your in your planning</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.260" end="00:38:47.700" style="s2">processes because I think we would all</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.170" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">agree that like none of us really</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.700" end="00:38:53.340" style="s2">believe in linearity anymore and even</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.710" style="s2">the you know the guy sitting across from</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.270" end="00:39:18.920" style="s2">yeah like you know extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.630" end="00:39:21.770" style="s2">and sort of movements that are more sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.920" end="00:39:25.160" style="s2">of protest focused on you know peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.770" end="00:39:28.040" style="s2">civil disobedience you could on one hand</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">of problem focused approach where iam in</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.070" end="00:39:34.520" style="s2">the regenerative community is you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.350" style="s2">we try to work from place source of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.520" end="00:39:40.100" style="s2">potential right where I&#39;m sort of a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.350" end="00:39:43.430" style="s2">uh sort of positive optimist and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.100" end="00:39:44.600" style="s2">lone hopeful at least movement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.430" end="00:39:47.120" style="s2">looking for sort of deep transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.600" end="00:39:49.640" style="s2">but not sort of picking out all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.120" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">problems and working at problems and yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.640" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t actually know the role</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:57.290" style="s2">that some of those civil disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:40:00.740" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re probably they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.290" end="00:40:03.290" style="s2">raising the bar and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.740" end="00:40:06.980" style="s2">consciousness around this work that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.290" end="00:40:09.650" style="s2">creates the conditions that allows our</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.980" end="00:40:11.780" style="s2">work to be successful so if we get</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.650" end="00:40:13.880" style="s2">caught in this oh that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.780" end="00:40:17.630" style="s2">approach I would take or what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.880" end="00:40:19.640" style="s2">guy&#39;s problem like he&#39;s doing then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.630" end="00:40:21.950" style="s2">then we could we don&#39;t know because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.640" end="00:40:24.680" style="s2">know we don&#39;t know what effect that will</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.950" end="00:40:27.700" style="s2">ultimately have which is why I really</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.680" end="00:40:30.860" style="s2">try to focus and embody and live by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.700" end="00:40:35.150" style="s2">you know growing my own capability and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.860" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">capacity to hold coexisting and diverse</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:41.180" style="s2">perspectives in every moment basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">yeah no I completely hear and that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.180" end="00:40:46.970" style="s2">day&#39;s the essence of working regenitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:50.980" style="s2">like the the a like for example even</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.970" end="00:40:54.470" style="s2">just but sticking with exile briefly and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.980" end="00:40:56.510" style="s2">they from last year to this you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.470" end="00:40:59.570" style="s2">already made a significant change in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.510" end="00:41:02.090" style="s2">languaging from where the key words were</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.570" end="00:41:07.930" style="s2">extinction rebellion and rebelled for</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.090" end="00:41:11.170" style="s2">life and two more regenerate 2020 and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.930" end="00:41:11.170" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:16.870" style="s2">I love extinction rebellion and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.360" end="00:41:19.880" style="s2">trying to kill them no no me neither</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.870" end="00:41:21.950" style="s2">like I am so grateful that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.880" end="00:41:23.380" style="s2">actually included regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.950" end="00:41:25.910" style="s2">as one of their principles and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.380" end="00:41:28.040" style="s2">regenerative culture and while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.910" end="00:41:30.170" style="s2">still dancing with is this just the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.040" end="00:41:33.490" style="s2">culture that how do we support ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.170" end="00:41:37.900" style="s2">in our activism and non direct action</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.490" end="00:41:40.340" style="s2">non-violent direct action and and in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.900" end="00:41:42.250" style="s2">raising the movement and and and taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.340" end="00:41:45.320" style="s2">care of the movement or is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.250" end="00:41:47.960" style="s2">but I think the regenerative cultures is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.320" end="00:41:54.830" style="s2">actually the answer of how we stop this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.960" end="00:41:56.450" style="s2">extinction crisis and avoid runaway</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.830" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">climate change and and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:42:01.370" style="s2">breakdown that everybody now seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:04.460" style="s2">so focused on that we&#39;re almost calling</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.370" end="00:42:07.790" style="s2">it in um if if we don&#39;t leave the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.460" end="00:42:10.370" style="s2">possibility of working a miracle that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.790" end="00:42:12.380" style="s2">back door open and I mean I would love</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.370" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">to share with you just briefly something</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.380" end="00:42:20.300" style="s2">that that really you know how that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.470" end="00:42:22.670" style="s2">holding rather than falling into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.300" end="00:42:24.050" style="s2">paradigm shift we need to go from this</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.670" end="00:42:27.800" style="s2">kind of thinking to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.050" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">thinking and in trying to force people</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.800" end="00:42:34.310" style="s2">along on the journey the the holding the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:36.230" style="s2">polarity between different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.310" end="00:42:39.950" style="s2">the activating in the restraining force</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.230" end="00:42:42.830" style="s2">and looking for the potential that there</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.950" end="00:42:46.540" style="s2">lies in not saying it&#39;s an either/or</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.830" end="00:42:50.060" style="s2">these both perspectives in form and in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.540" end="00:42:52.850" style="s2">like for the longest time when when</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.060" end="00:42:56.270" style="s2">again wonderful well-meaning people that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.850" end="00:42:58.940" style="s2">I know who are very much into the you</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.270" end="00:43:01.100" style="s2">process and Otto shamans work and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.940" end="00:43:04.010" style="s2">all the working with all these these you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.100" end="00:43:07.390" style="s2">labs all around the world and they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.010" end="00:43:13.160" style="s2">very often used the ego to equal M</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.390" end="00:43:15.800" style="s2">framing um and and it always rang a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.160" end="00:43:18.770" style="s2">little bit to either or for me like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.800" end="00:43:21.530" style="s2">sort of there in the seed of making that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.770" end="00:43:24.200" style="s2">move ours felt that&#39;s not a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.530" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">relationship to relate to self</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.200" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">and let&#39;s not be devil-like I mean ego</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:32.540" style="s2">has become a bad word and of course in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:35.750" style="s2">certain interpretation of the word we</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.540" end="00:43:37.579" style="s2">know why but what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.750" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">earlier as well in a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.579" end="00:43:42.799" style="s2">ones in this conversation is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:46.250" style="s2">tension this polarity that is common to</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.799" end="00:43:49.670" style="s2">all life which is being for oneself and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.250" end="00:43:51.589" style="s2">being as part of a larger whole and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.670" end="00:43:54.710" style="s2">I just wanna share this image pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.589" end="00:44:02.599" style="s2">with you because and I don&#39;t know is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.710" end="00:44:05.059" style="s2">and share screen this one I found this</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.599" end="00:44:06.740" style="s2">in a linear next to each other way and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.059" end="00:44:13.569" style="s2">have just played around whether to put</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.740" end="00:44:17.510" style="s2">it into a tetrad you know try it like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.569" end="00:44:19.190" style="s2">the ego eco dimension of how do I take</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.510" end="00:44:22.099" style="s2">care of my family my community in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.190" end="00:44:27.799" style="s2">place and do my work right here right</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.099" end="00:44:29.900" style="s2">now in this place and how do I build the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.799" end="00:44:32.359" style="s2">connection to serving the larger whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.900" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">that this place is part of whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.359" end="00:44:37.099" style="s2">my community in this bio region or this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:39.500" style="s2">bio region within the biosphere and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.099" end="00:44:41.809" style="s2">way we resolve that tension is if on</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.500" end="00:44:45.950" style="s2">both ends we actually understand that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.809" end="00:44:48.710" style="s2">serving life and but as a keystone</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.950" end="00:44:52.549" style="s2">species like because that another danger</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.710" end="00:44:55.130" style="s2">of this ego eco framing for me is either</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.549" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">you deny the importance of self-care and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.130" end="00:44:59.720" style="s2">you will not be able to serve your</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:02.180" style="s2">community and the planet if you can&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.720" end="00:45:07.990" style="s2">you don&#39;t serve yourself and your family</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.180" end="00:45:13.540" style="s2">mmm but also in getting lost in just</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.990" end="00:45:16.670" style="s2">serving they like their and I&#39;ve lost my</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.540" end="00:45:19.910" style="s2">my train of thought right now and I had</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.670" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">the the subsuming into Eco of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.910" end="00:45:23.869" style="s2">we&#39;re human beings were so wrong with we</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:26.180" style="s2">just have to be part of the web of life</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.869" end="00:45:29.390" style="s2">and and be humble little critters in it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.180" end="00:45:31.130" style="s2">m is is not speaking to the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.390" end="00:45:32.990" style="s2">human beings it&#39;s not speaking to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.130" end="00:45:35.000" style="s2">the fact that we can actually and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.990" end="00:45:37.190" style="s2">now that we have fucked up the system so</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.000" end="00:45:38.420" style="s2">badly on so many levels we have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.190" end="00:45:41.900" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.420" end="00:45:44.750" style="s2">to become healers and keystone species</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.900" end="00:45:47.210" style="s2">and nurture health and resilience and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.750" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">abundance and and increased by</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.210" end="00:45:55.730" style="s2">productivity and again it&#39;s an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:58.040" style="s2">wisdom and that like buddy what do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.730" end="00:46:00.760" style="s2">think about this resolution well yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.040" end="00:46:04.040" style="s2">I think it&#39;s ancient wisdom and when</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.760" end="00:46:06.829" style="s2">sometimes people you know when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.040" end="00:46:09.799" style="s2">about ancient wisdoms and having you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.829" end="00:46:11.630" style="s2">know going back to people think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.799" end="00:46:13.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re suggesting we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.630" end="00:46:18.020" style="s2">that and and really it&#39;s not about going</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.400" end="00:46:19.819" style="s2">back it&#39;s being from being of that and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.020" end="00:46:22.579" style="s2">was reminded by what you said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.819" end="00:46:24.980" style="s2">you know how you have these sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.579" end="00:46:26.359" style="s2">profound like realizations on something</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.980" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">and usually when you have a profound</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.359" end="00:46:30.680" style="s2">realization on something it&#39;s some it</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:33.020" style="s2">feels like you&#39;re remembering something</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.680" end="00:46:34.760" style="s2">that you already knew and it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.020" end="00:46:36.650" style="s2">simple and in a lot of ways it feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.760" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">like you&#39;re going back to and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.650" end="00:46:43.640" style="s2">what awareness is right awareness</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:46.309" style="s2">happens instantaneous realization of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.640" end="00:46:48.290" style="s2">something that has always been there but</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.309" end="00:46:50.420" style="s2">now you&#39;re fully understanding what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.290" end="00:46:53.569" style="s2">what it means and I I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.420" end="00:46:55.880" style="s2">that probably transformation is similar</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.569" end="00:46:57.980" style="s2">to that like I sort of have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.880" end="00:47:00.200" style="s2">and maybe I got this from Krishnamurti</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.980" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not remembering a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.200" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">attribution</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.220" end="00:47:09.740" style="s2">but I but you know this idea that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:12.470" style="s2">transformation is instantaneous it will</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.740" end="00:47:15.740" style="s2">happen like that which sort of for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:17.150" style="s2">rationalist you know mind is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.740" end="00:47:19.329" style="s2">wrap your head around right there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.150" end="00:47:21.980" style="s2">much to do right we&#39;re so far away from</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.329" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">transformation there&#39;s there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.980" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">work to be done it needs to be done so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:28.369" style="s2">quickly and yet we just really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:30.859" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.369" end="00:47:33.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s increasingly clear I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.859" end="00:47:35.180" style="s2">people&#39;s lives are changed overnight you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.650" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">know you can have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.180" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">someone you know lately and this new</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:40.970" style="s2">science of kovat have been feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:43.490" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve never even met in</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.970" end="00:47:46.670" style="s2">person I&#39;m all the sudden like deeply</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.490" end="00:47:51.350" style="s2">connected to in very little time and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.670" end="00:47:53.870" style="s2">so yeah I just not to get all no weird</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.350" end="00:47:56.300" style="s2">but they I just I feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.870" end="00:47:58.430" style="s2">timescales there are so many different</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.300" end="00:48:01.460" style="s2">timescales on how this is playing out</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.430" end="00:48:03.560" style="s2">and transformation I think we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.460" end="00:48:05.990" style="s2">beginning to comprehend what that could</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.560" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">mean right now we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.990" end="00:48:11.570" style="s2">transformation means change and change</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">requires a lot of work but that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.570" end="00:48:16.850" style="s2">change being a lot of work is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:20.120" style="s2">coming from that sort of industrial</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.850" end="00:48:22.340" style="s2">mindset right that that a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.120" end="00:48:26.300" style="s2">requires a big response and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.340" end="00:48:28.760" style="s2">be a huge undertaking I completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.300" end="00:48:29.840" style="s2">resonate with that and it brings me to</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.760" end="00:48:34.220" style="s2">there&#39;s two things that I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.840" end="00:48:37.550" style="s2">definitely still want to cover and one</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.220" end="00:48:40.190" style="s2">of them is I want to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.550" end="00:48:42.950" style="s2">the Alliance that you&#39;ve been building I</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.190" end="00:48:45.620" style="s2">know who&#39;s involved but it would be nice</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.950" end="00:48:47.540" style="s2">to hear you share share it and but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.620" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">other thing is which which I did we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.540" end="00:48:53.300" style="s2">talked about between ourselves before</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:55.700" style="s2">and which I think he also - like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.300" end="00:49:01.010" style="s2">heard it what you just said landed in me</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.700" end="00:49:04.550" style="s2">in that way is that really this tension</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.010" end="00:49:08.600" style="s2">between like I you know I use the word</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.550" end="00:49:11.950" style="s2">glocal a lot and working locally like</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.600" end="00:49:16.490" style="s2">how do you where you put your energy of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.950" end="00:49:19.090" style="s2">being truly rich generatively in place</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.490" end="00:49:22.490" style="s2">changing your being state having more</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.090" end="00:49:27.380" style="s2">connection with your community your land</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.490" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">and taking the time for rituals of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.380" end="00:49:35.930" style="s2">connection with people in place and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:38.030" style="s2">really practicing this how do I</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.930" end="00:49:40.730" style="s2">contribute to the next greater whole in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.030" end="00:49:43.910" style="s2">in a daily way in your bio region and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.730" end="00:49:46.520" style="s2">then the other thing is connecting all</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.910" end="00:49:48.950" style="s2">the good people that are coming into</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.520" end="00:49:53.810" style="s2">that way of being all over the place all</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.950" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">over the planet and enabling them to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.810" end="00:49:59.300" style="s2">feel part of other of an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.640" style="s2">movement that more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.300" end="00:50:03.300" style="s2">coming home to a place that more people</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.640" end="00:50:05.580" style="s2">wanting to Rhian habit</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.300" end="00:50:08.340" style="s2">they&#39;re bioregions and and become</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.580" end="00:50:13.890" style="s2">healing presences in community and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.340" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">ecosystem and I personally find that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.890" end="00:50:19.790" style="s2">live an enormous tension in in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:22.080" style="s2">where do I put my energy because when I</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.790" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">listen to either of people that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.080" end="00:50:26.430" style="s2">very strongly focused on either of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:29.310" style="s2">those scales the very local or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.430" end="00:50:33.560" style="s2">global connecting it&#39;s so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.310" end="00:50:36.870" style="s2">important work both of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.560" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">somehow I think we need both em but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.870" end="00:50:46.040" style="s2">get lost in terms of my own capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:48.810" style="s2">in terms of time and energy and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.040" end="00:50:51.480" style="s2">you&#39;re it just means you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.810" end="00:50:55.140" style="s2">attention yeah of course you&#39;re lost</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.480" end="00:50:58.740" style="s2">we&#39;re all lost you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.140" end="00:51:02.490" style="s2">really challenging to live and to live</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.740" end="00:51:05.250" style="s2">in these two two to fully be yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.490" end="00:51:08.040" style="s2">and support you know regeneration at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.250" end="00:51:09.630" style="s2">family scale and a local scale and a bio</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.040" end="00:51:13.380" style="s2">regional scale and then also be working</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.630" end="00:51:15.720" style="s2">on the global side so to to think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.380" end="00:51:17.970" style="s2">that would just somehow be easy is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.720" end="00:51:21.150" style="s2">total illusion right and but I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.970" end="00:51:25.170" style="s2">just encourage us all to to also like</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.150" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">that we always have this idea if only I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.170" end="00:51:31.110" style="s2">could be in that place then everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:33.840" style="s2">would work out or if only I could you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.110" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">know I would have only had enough money</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.840" end="00:51:37.860" style="s2">to leave my office job and farm the land</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:41.010" style="s2">then that would be like the real</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.860" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">transformative you know decision and I I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.010" end="00:51:48.990" style="s2">think that that&#39;s not quite it I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:51.600" style="s2">that actually transformation is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.990" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">available to us in any in any context</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.600" end="00:51:57.540" style="s2">and that that feeling of tension and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:52:00.690" style="s2">confusion and being conflicted between</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.540" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">those those are all signs of a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.690" end="00:52:07.290" style="s2">person right so feel encouraged that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:10.590" style="s2">you&#39;re discouraged because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.290" end="00:52:13.260" style="s2">would be numb you know if everything was</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.590" end="00:52:16.110" style="s2">going perfect and you know it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.260" end="00:52:17.190" style="s2">like you know those of us who are you</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.110" end="00:52:19.530" style="s2">know you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.190" end="00:52:22.859" style="s2">the CEO has just got it all together and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.530" end="00:52:25.140" style="s2">he&#39;s perfectly happy great life and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.859" end="00:52:28.109" style="s2">actually those are the most dangerous I</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.140" end="00:52:30.930" style="s2">think you know people in this society</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.109" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re completely numb</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.930" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">to the illness in and disease in you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:42.539" style="s2">know are in our society in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">and they&#39;ve completely given over to I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.539" end="00:52:49.349" style="s2">think I think again it was Krishnamurti</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:52.819" style="s2">you know it is no sign of health to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.349" end="00:52:56.940" style="s2">well adjusted in a sick society right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.819" end="00:53:02.630" style="s2">and so yeah so yeah honor your</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.940" end="00:53:06.299" style="s2">discomfort and yeah lean into that edge</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.630" end="00:53:08.190" style="s2">beautiful I mean Paul Hawken just quoted</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.299" end="00:53:10.440" style="s2">it it&#39;s by some woman author I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.190" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">remember her name this notion of Blessed</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.440" end="00:53:16.369" style="s2">unrest that drives so many of us I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:18.270" style="s2">is yeah again it&#39;s another thing of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.369" end="00:53:21.240" style="s2">framing what I was saying earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.270" end="00:53:23.069" style="s2">the there&#39;s no in destination there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.240" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">no perfect to have my cake in eat it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.069" end="00:53:27.630" style="s2">there&#39;s mob if only I had all this in</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.400" style="s2">place then I could live happily ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.630" end="00:53:31.710" style="s2">after it&#39;s to just really embrace that</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.400" end="00:53:33.270" style="s2">these tensions are part of being in life</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.710" end="00:53:35.490" style="s2">and they were part of what&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.270" end="00:53:37.470" style="s2">things interesting and creative but it</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.490" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">also means sometimes you have to listen</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.470" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">to them and understand what I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:45.960" style="s2">to my personal life right now is to also</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:48.420" style="s2">say there&#39;s a breathing in and out with</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.960" end="00:53:50.430" style="s2">these things and like right now I have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.420" end="00:53:56.119" style="s2">young daughter and if for the next 2 or</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.430" end="00:53:56.119" style="s2">3 years I swing more on the side of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.299" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">planting a food forest and creating a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.450" end="00:54:06.089" style="s2">little watering hole in which I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:10.829" style="s2">welcome my local community to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.089" end="00:54:13.170" style="s2">about our bio region it&#39;s a time where I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.829" end="00:54:14.220" style="s2">can be there for my daughter and do all</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.170" end="00:54:19.049" style="s2">the things that are also really</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.220" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">important to really live em and practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.049" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">what I preach and and and then to trust</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.589" style="s2">that it&#39;s not my responsibility to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:30.870" style="s2">any anything in the sense that that if</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.589" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2">this it&#39;s a global movement people</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.870" end="00:54:34.290" style="s2">pick up the ball and run with it for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:37.560" style="s2">next three years if I if I found less</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.290" end="00:54:39.930" style="s2">online and more analogue for a few years</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.560" end="00:54:41.790" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sort of narcissism in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.930" end="00:54:44.100" style="s2">believing that I have to be in both</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.790" end="00:54:47.250" style="s2">areas because my contribution is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.100" end="00:54:49.380" style="s2">important and like it&#39;s also okay to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.250" end="00:54:50.940" style="s2">just disappear for a while and and take</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.380" end="00:54:57.150" style="s2">care of the caretakers at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.940" end="00:54:58.650" style="s2">what I&#39;m yeah I I live in a house with</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.150" end="00:55:01.800" style="s2">four generations I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.650" end="00:55:03.390" style="s2">know this I my tickets my husband my</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.800" end="00:55:07.020" style="s2">husband&#39;s parents and my husband&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.390" end="00:55:11.970" style="s2">grandparents and a three-story house and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.020" end="00:55:14.580" style="s2">I see you know you know my mother-in-law</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.970" end="00:55:17.130" style="s2">has completely given herself to caring</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.580" end="00:55:20.310" style="s2">for my children when I&#39;m at work all day</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.130" end="00:55:23.330" style="s2">and she also has her mother who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.310" end="00:55:26.010" style="s2">elderly and is also caring for her and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.330" end="00:55:29.820" style="s2">you just when you&#39;re in that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.010" end="00:55:32.310" style="s2">like close up in that reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.820" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">that like that is seriously</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.310" end="00:55:39.990" style="s2">transformative work like it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:42.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s um yeah we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.990" end="00:55:45.570" style="s2">where the most change is happening and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.750" end="00:55:47.510" style="s2">to try to measure it constantly I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.570" end="00:55:49.770" style="s2">is missing the point</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.510" end="00:55:52.290" style="s2">and I think yeah is there the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.770" end="00:55:55.530" style="s2">regeneration movement is is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.290" end="00:55:58.110" style="s2">moving towards you know alternative</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.530" end="00:56:00.660" style="s2">metrics and ways of evaluating how we</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.110" end="00:56:02.400" style="s2">are being impactful and I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.660" end="00:56:05.070" style="s2">encouraged to see so many of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:07.710" style="s2">colleagues that are you know really</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.070" end="00:56:10.980" style="s2">thinking about regeneration at a family</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.710" end="00:56:12.570" style="s2">scale at a local scale in you know how</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.980" end="00:56:14.870" style="s2">well they know their neighbors for</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.570" end="00:56:18.050" style="s2">example I mean these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.870" end="00:56:21.510" style="s2">critical dimensions of what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.050" end="00:56:24.830" style="s2">regeneration and if we are pin sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.510" end="00:56:26.730" style="s2">point focused on our professional</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.830" end="00:56:30.450" style="s2">contributions to the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.730" end="00:56:32.940" style="s2">development movement I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.450" end="00:56:36.540" style="s2">increasingly we will find that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.940" end="00:56:38.970" style="s2">impulse is part of what we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.540" end="00:56:40.830" style="s2">move away from and yet it&#39;s still so</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.970" end="00:56:43.530" style="s2">hard and I struggle with it constantly</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.830" end="00:56:44.010" style="s2">so I&#39;m not suggesting one enlightens</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.530" end="00:56:47.550" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.010" end="00:56:50.490" style="s2">it helps so much to just voice these</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.550" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">things and also find peers struggling</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.490" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">with the same dilemmas and embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:57.240" style="s2">same paradoxes because then I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:59.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the power of circle work and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.240" end="00:57:00.120" style="s2">sitting in a console circle that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.100" end="00:57:02.190" style="s2">hear other people</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.120" end="00:57:04.350" style="s2">voice something that you were starting</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.190" end="00:57:06.300" style="s2">to all I was starting to think like am I</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.350" end="00:57:08.430" style="s2">crazy I&#39;m a what&#39;s going on I need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.300" end="00:57:09.840" style="s2">and then when you hear somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.430" end="00:57:12.690" style="s2">okay they&#39;re struggling with the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.840" end="00:57:15.060" style="s2">human dynamic it gives yourself sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.690" end="00:57:18.150" style="s2">permission to say okay maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.060" end="00:57:23.010" style="s2">crazy no I mean this is what this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.150" end="00:57:26.670" style="s2">what Regenesis calls second line work in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.010" end="00:57:29.250" style="s2">the sense that it&#39;s we we have to hold</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.670" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">each other in this field in order for</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.250" end="00:57:36.150" style="s2">the field to to grow and to evolve and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.630" end="00:57:40.170" style="s2">to enter into our collective</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.150" end="00:57:42.750" style="s2">consciousness and that&#39;s that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.170" end="00:57:44.730" style="s2">always say it&#39;s it&#39;s this is awareness</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.750" end="00:57:47.720" style="s2">building work its solidarity it&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.730" end="00:57:51.630" style="s2">in solidarity it&#39;s make its we have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">we have to sort of build the social</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.630" end="00:57:59.460" style="s2">scaffolding and infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:58:01.740" style="s2">allows us to do this work and in the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.460" end="00:58:04.530" style="s2">we are working on each other we we may</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:07.020" style="s2">think we are you know making the food</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.530" end="00:58:08.670" style="s2">forest or you know creating a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.020" end="00:58:11.940" style="s2">regenerative development map and yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.670" end="00:58:14.520" style="s2">that is one aspect but there is so much</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.940" end="00:58:16.820" style="s2">more going on and the more that we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.520" end="00:58:20.190" style="s2">sort of creatively lean into that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.820" end="00:58:21.720" style="s2">mystery of the lark somebody the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.190" end="00:58:24.030" style="s2">sort of mysterious thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.720" end="00:58:28.770" style="s2">happening that we&#39;re all part of I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.030" end="00:58:31.320" style="s2">the closer I think the yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.770" end="00:58:34.590" style="s2">evolutionary leap that we are that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.320" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">wanting to happen will we&#39;ll get closer</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.590" end="00:58:43.170" style="s2">to us like Rhonda said we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:45.560" style="s2">walking each other home yeah who are the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.170" end="00:58:49.350" style="s2">people that after over the like since</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.560" end="00:58:50.610" style="s2">2016 building and these meetings at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.350" end="00:58:52.440" style="s2">Commonwealth had started with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.610" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">impulse regenerative development to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.440" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">reverse climate change and have gone</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">into all these transformations</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:03.729" style="s2">then Commonwealth was created and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:05.979" style="s2">launched last October and now you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.729" end="00:59:08.430" style="s2">moving in like even mapped and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.979" end="00:59:10.959" style="s2">had conversations where people in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.430" end="00:59:14.440" style="s2">grassroots end of the spectrum and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.959" end="00:59:17.079" style="s2">also people political players who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.440" end="00:59:21.160" style="s2">willing to take their member nations of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.079" end="00:59:24.459" style="s2">the of the Commonwealth em into Road</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.160" end="00:59:26.979" style="s2">mapping processes and it&#39;s New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.459" end="00:59:29.079" style="s2">or a non Commonwealth member in Costa</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.979" end="00:59:32.529" style="s2">Rica with the leadership of Miller</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.079" end="00:59:35.859" style="s2">joining this idea can we pioneer one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.529" end="00:59:37.809" style="s2">those Roman mapping processes II in in</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.859" end="00:59:40.719" style="s2">this mapping in these conversations what</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.809" end="00:59:44.589" style="s2">some of the pioneering people in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.719" end="00:59:46.869" style="s2">world doing regenerative work um who</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.589" end="00:59:49.869" style="s2">have you identified that that you will</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.869" end="00:59:52.119" style="s2">build this alliance with and and what</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.869" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">are the the the projects that currently</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.119" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">give you most hope that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:05.650" style="s2">something transformative is emerging</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:07.180" style="s2">yeah I mean the the main the primary</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.650" end="01:00:10.209" style="s2">people that are involved</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.180" end="01:00:12.609" style="s2">I mean Rolla obviously is the mother and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.209" end="01:00:17.319" style="s2">the constant caretaker of everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.609" end="01:00:19.269" style="s2">that we do have been haggard recently</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.319" end="01:00:21.849" style="s2">gave this analogy of Marilla which I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.269" end="01:00:23.769" style="s2">thought was brilliant was that in in</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.849" end="01:00:25.779" style="s2">some of the Lama Buddhist communities</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.769" end="01:00:28.199" style="s2">that he&#39;s part of when a when an</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.779" end="01:00:30.759" style="s2">important conference or meeting or</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.199" end="01:00:36.789" style="s2">meditation session is taking place there</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.759" end="01:00:39.329" style="s2">will be one sort of elder monk that will</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.789" end="01:00:42.699" style="s2">that will sit in another room and well</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.329" end="01:00:44.589" style="s2">well these ceremony is taking place or</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.699" end="01:00:46.709" style="s2">the session is taking place they will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.589" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">in a deep state of meditation holding</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.709" end="01:00:53.049" style="s2">holding the sorry I&#39;m not a Buddhist and</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:56.259" style="s2">not very to talk about this but they</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.049" end="01:00:58.390" style="s2">will be sort of holding them keeping the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.259" end="01:01:02.709" style="s2">candle alive keeping the fire alive for</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.390" end="01:01:04.630" style="s2">the entire for the entire group and role</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.709" end="01:01:08.229" style="s2">is sort of like that she&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:01:08.229" end="01:01:14.800" style="s2">much more but like in her</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.050" end="01:01:17.170" style="s2">and you know that that that whatever he</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.800" end="01:01:20.080" style="s2">described is actually happening at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.170" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">United Nations like people don&#39;t lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.080" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">people don&#39;t know that but there is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.580" style="s2">there is something called the spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:27.640" style="s2">caucus of the United Nations and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.580" end="01:01:30.670" style="s2">a meditation room at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.640" end="01:01:34.900" style="s2">building where the the big hall that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.670" end="01:01:37.480" style="s2">always see the Security Council meeting</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:41.980" style="s2">in and all that when when the Security</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.480" end="01:01:44.349" style="s2">Council is in session about the global</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.980" end="01:01:46.030" style="s2">crisis there&#39;s always people underneath</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.349" end="01:01:54.420" style="s2">holding the space in that way like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.030" end="01:02:00.609" style="s2">actually meditating and and holding yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.420" end="01:02:02.980" style="s2">so yeah so beyond that the we&#39;ve the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.609" end="01:02:06.040" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been evolving common earth</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.980" end="01:02:10.300" style="s2">alliances we started with pulling</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.040" end="01:02:14.460" style="s2">together a core team so myself or</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.300" end="01:02:21.460" style="s2">Alastair Cowan and Haggard Pamela Ming</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.460" end="01:02:22.859" style="s2">may East and several others have come in</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.460" end="01:02:28.060" style="s2">and out it&#39;s sort of an informal</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.859" end="01:02:30.849" style="s2">gathering and the core team chartered</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.060" end="01:02:33.550" style="s2">the common Earth Alliance so we worked</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.849" end="01:02:36.130" style="s2">on what is the what is the purpose and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.550" end="01:02:37.780" style="s2">the role what is the ultimate end state</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.130" end="01:02:40.630" style="s2">vision that were that we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.780" end="01:02:46.510" style="s2">towards and so the core team chartered</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.630" end="01:02:49.570" style="s2">that and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve adopted this sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.510" end="01:02:51.940" style="s2">of structure that Pamela Ming and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.570" end="01:02:55.000" style="s2">Regenesis folks introduced to us called</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.940" end="01:02:56.140" style="s2">core team task team field team and</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.000" end="01:02:59.250" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s a very flexible</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.140" end="01:03:02.410" style="s2">structure that is designed to support</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.250" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">emergence so the core team is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.410" end="01:03:09.220" style="s2">keeping the big picture always sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:10.990" style="s2">alive and then fields teams form or what</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.220" end="01:03:15.550" style="s2">we call working groups in our case</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.990" end="01:03:17.710" style="s2">around specific topics mostly in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.550" end="01:03:19.210" style="s2">the infrastructure I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.710" end="01:03:20.859" style="s2">infrastructure differently than we</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.210" end="01:03:22.779" style="s2">typically think of it but like you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.859" end="01:03:27.999" style="s2">big topics like education or</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.779" end="01:03:29.469" style="s2">Nantz or gender national scale</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.999" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">regenerative development planning</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.469" end="01:03:35.199" style="s2">processes these working groups have</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:37.059" style="s2">formed and a core team member is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.199" end="01:03:40.919" style="s2">present in each one of the working</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.059" end="01:03:45.099" style="s2">groups and then as these working groups</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.919" end="01:03:49.059" style="s2">sort of scope and define the trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.099" end="01:03:53.049" style="s2">of their work as a team task teams</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.059" end="01:03:58.239" style="s2">bubble up to focus on specific topics or</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.049" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">deliver a project so the working groups</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.239" end="01:04:02.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve launched three key working</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:06.039" style="s2">groups regenerative finance regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.890" end="01:04:09.489" style="s2">road mapping and a project and a working</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.039" end="01:04:13.439" style="s2">group focused on projects and each one</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.489" end="01:04:16.839" style="s2">of these working groups is chaired by an</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.439" end="01:04:21.249" style="s2">individual so did not not roll over me</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.839" end="01:04:23.799" style="s2">basically and so Stuart Cowan is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.249" end="01:04:26.909" style="s2">chair or the key facilitator of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.799" end="01:04:29.619" style="s2">regenerative finance working group and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.909" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">we&#39;re 1212 I think there&#39;s twelve people</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.619" end="01:04:35.439" style="s2">on the finance working group Caroline</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:37.419" style="s2">Robinson and New Zealand and Edward</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.439" end="01:04:39.519" style="s2">Mueller in Costa Rica are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.419" end="01:04:41.079" style="s2">co-chairing and co-facilitating the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.519" end="01:04:46.409" style="s2">regenerative Road mapping working group</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.079" end="01:04:49.449" style="s2">and then David Hodgson is facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.409" end="01:04:53.380" style="s2">the project working group and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.449" end="01:04:55.119" style="s2">just getting off the ground now so each</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.380" end="01:04:58.390" style="s2">and so each one of these working groups</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.119" end="01:05:00.249" style="s2">you can see how there&#39;s overlap between</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.390" end="01:05:03.549" style="s2">the working groups and the core team in</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.249" end="01:05:08.380" style="s2">an attempt to foster alignment and</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.549" end="01:05:12.699" style="s2">collaboration in service of the you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.380" end="01:05:15.429" style="s2">the final end state sort of gold and all</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.699" end="01:05:17.259" style="s2">of this is rooted in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.429" end="01:05:20.140" style="s2">Commonwealth so it&#39;s not some abstract</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.259" end="01:05:23.380" style="s2">thing and the core team has begun a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.140" end="01:05:25.269" style="s2">process of working on what we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.380" end="01:05:28.779" style="s2">a common Earth Alliance project</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.269" end="01:05:30.609" style="s2">portfolio and so the working groups and</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.779" end="01:05:33.759" style="s2">the core team and the wider alliance</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.609" end="01:05:35.250" style="s2">because as task teams bubble up the task</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.759" end="01:05:37.380" style="s2">teams also</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.250" end="01:05:39.660" style="s2">reach out beyond the working groups and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.380" end="01:05:44.370" style="s2">involved it&#39;s it&#39;s a very sort of fluid</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.660" end="01:05:47.910" style="s2">alive ongoing process and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.370" end="01:05:51.000" style="s2">anchored in this portfolio of projects</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.910" end="01:05:53.340" style="s2">and again the portfolio of projects it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.000" end="01:05:56.610" style="s2">it&#39;s very diverse geographically and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.340" end="01:05:59.510" style="s2">also in terms of scale and stages of</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.610" end="01:06:01.830" style="s2">development so you have projects such as</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.510" end="01:06:03.330" style="s2">Christopher Nesbit&#39;s my amount of</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.830" end="01:06:05.640" style="s2">research farm in the leaves that&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.330" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">scaling and looking at the rio grande</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.640" end="01:06:10.050" style="s2">watershed and southern Belize so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:12.990" style="s2">have a watershed scale project and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.050" end="01:06:16.770" style="s2">you have you know by a regional scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.990" end="01:06:18.450" style="s2">initiatives ecological mega region scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.770" end="01:06:21.990" style="s2">initiatives we&#39;re working on something</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.450" end="01:06:26.250" style="s2">with CARICOM the Caribbean community and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.990" end="01:06:28.410" style="s2">then you have national scale projects</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.250" end="01:06:30.780" style="s2">such as what&#39;s being brought forward in</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.410" end="01:06:34.350" style="s2">new zealand whatever muller is working</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.780" end="01:06:37.560" style="s2">on in costa rica and jason 12 to a large</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.350" end="01:06:41.130" style="s2">extent as well in australia has seated</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.560" end="01:06:46.680" style="s2">on national scale regenerate australia</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.130" end="01:06:48.660" style="s2">project i thought that the new zealand</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.680" end="01:06:50.970" style="s2">project initially was sort of Auckland</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.660" end="01:06:53.940" style="s2">Bay focus is that now moving to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.970" end="01:06:56.340" style="s2">national scale conversation moving to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.940" end="01:06:59.880" style="s2">national scale conversation and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.340" end="01:07:02.610" style="s2">a few calls with James Goodhue and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.880" end="01:07:04.530" style="s2">Wellington who&#39;s close with Jason Whelan</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.610" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">is working on an urban regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.530" end="01:07:11.330" style="s2">housing project in Wellington so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:15.090" style="s2">being pulled in but essentially the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.330" end="01:07:17.430" style="s2">national scale we&#39;re still we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.090" end="01:07:22.140" style="s2">sort of split we&#39;re still trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.430" end="01:07:24.990" style="s2">understand the role of the road map in</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.140" end="01:07:26.760" style="s2">working group in relation to a national</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.990" end="01:07:29.040" style="s2">scale effort so it&#39;s they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.760" end="01:07:31.020" style="s2">same so Edward Mueller has his sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.040" end="01:07:33.690" style="s2">in-country team that he&#39;s been evolving</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.020" end="01:07:36.750" style="s2">for years as Caroline Robinson has her</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.690" end="01:07:40.410" style="s2">auckland-based but now much larger team</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.750" end="01:07:43.230" style="s2">and so each one of these groups is</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.410" end="01:07:47.910" style="s2">involved with their own sort of process</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.230" end="01:07:48.869" style="s2">around thinking about how regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.910" end="01:07:51.059" style="s2">development plays</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.869" end="01:07:53.490" style="s2">at various scales ultimately at a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.059" end="01:07:55.019" style="s2">national scale but the common Earth</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.490" end="01:08:02.130" style="s2">Alliance regenerative roadmapping</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.019" end="01:08:04.289" style="s2">working group this is is still defining</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.130" end="01:08:06.599" style="s2">what its role is but it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.289" end="01:08:11.730" style="s2">probably more of like a thought leader</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.599" end="01:08:13.230" style="s2">role and Ana Ana role in you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.730" end="01:08:16.830" style="s2">only had one meeting you have our second</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.230" end="01:08:20.219" style="s2">meeting tonight actually but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.830" end="01:08:22.350" style="s2">looking at the role of story in you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.219" end="01:08:27.540" style="s2">national scale regeneration because a</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.350" end="01:08:29.810" style="s2">lot of times framing a story around what</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.540" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">because you know the idea is not to</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.810" end="01:08:35.960" style="s2">replicate regenerative technologies all</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:39.750" style="s2">over New Zealand it&#39;s it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.960" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">about I think fostering solidarity and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.750" end="01:08:45.870" style="s2">hooking it in with national Clinton</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:48.449" style="s2">processes at a government level so</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.870" end="01:08:54.299" style="s2">anyway so there&#39;s a lot of territories</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.449" end="01:08:55.770" style="s2">to to be explored still but the common</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.299" end="01:08:59.190" style="s2">Earth Alliance Road mapping working</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.770" end="01:09:01.440" style="s2">group is a group of individuals that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.190" end="01:09:03.330" style="s2">thinking about regenerative development</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.440" end="01:09:09.420" style="s2">at national scales or have been engaged</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.330" end="01:09:11.190" style="s2">in some capacity in that in green I just</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.420" end="01:09:12.569" style="s2">saw something that sort of ties to a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.190" end="01:09:16.949" style="s2">loop - at the beginning of our</p>

<p begin="01:09:31.020" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">linked in to the policy-making process</p>

<p begin="01:09:49.770" end="01:09:57.630" style="s2">in abling the political architecture</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.330" end="01:10:00.510" style="s2">through really making subsidiarity the</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.180" end="01:10:24.750" style="s2">my own life at the moment is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.890" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">actually the work on subsidiarity is</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.750" end="01:10:36.090" style="s2">hugely important and like we will not</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:38.310" style="s2">get this process of capacity building in</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.090" end="01:10:42.090" style="s2">place to help people in place to</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.590" end="01:11:03.180" style="s2">the political process in a different way</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.630" end="01:11:05.580" style="s2">and make decisions at at scales that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.180" end="01:11:06.720" style="s2">really matter to them and so it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.580" end="01:11:10.620" style="s2">like we need to flip the entire</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.720" end="01:11:13.590" style="s2">political process from regional and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.620" end="01:11:15.960" style="s2">national and international scale taking</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.590" end="01:11:18.720" style="s2">on really important coordinating roles</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.960" end="01:11:21.420" style="s2">but not the the rank and the power that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.720" end="01:11:24.210" style="s2">they have but the rank sort of needs to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.420" end="01:11:26.700" style="s2">be flipped into that it&#39;s it&#39;s the local</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.210" end="01:11:30.530" style="s2">communities that need to be one part is</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.700" end="01:11:34.440" style="s2">that conversation at all on the map in</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.530" end="01:11:36.810" style="s2">in that process or not I realize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.440" end="01:11:39.570" style="s2">very alive and it&#39;s we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.810" end="01:11:43.470" style="s2">clear answers but what I will say is</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.570" end="01:11:45.420" style="s2">that we tend to think of capacity</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.470" end="01:11:47.400" style="s2">development as like this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.420" end="01:11:50.070" style="s2">needs to happen locally where as</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.400" end="01:11:52.770" style="s2">capacity development actually needs to</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.070" end="01:11:54.750" style="s2">happen up and down you know nested</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.770" end="01:11:57.240" style="s2">scales you know you can&#39;t just build</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.750" end="01:11:58.360" style="s2">capacity locally and then have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.240" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">government not understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.360" end="01:12:03.219" style="s2">and the value of it you have to you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:05.980" style="s2">to do it at all scales so common Earth</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.219" end="01:12:08.739" style="s2">Alliance you know what it&#39;s really doing</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.980" end="01:12:10.510" style="s2">you keep hearing me say the real work is</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.739" end="01:12:12.100" style="s2">working on each other and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.510" end="01:12:15.310" style="s2">mean by capability and capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.100" end="01:12:17.080" style="s2">development we we need to work with each</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.310" end="01:12:22.929" style="s2">other in a variety of different ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.080" end="01:12:25.449" style="s2">up and down nested scales to change the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.929" end="01:12:29.260" style="s2">way that we live and work and approach</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.449" end="01:12:31.980" style="s2">problems or potential in the case of you</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.260" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">know regenerative development and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.980" end="01:12:39.310" style="s2">capacity development that&#39;s the goal of</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:41.469" style="s2">common earth yet not the goal the well</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.310" end="01:12:46.139" style="s2">in a lot of ways it is it is a goal is</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.469" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">to be able to collectively in a highly</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.139" end="01:12:52.420" style="s2">coordinated way work on capability and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:55.659" style="s2">capacity development up and down these</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.420" end="01:13:00.969" style="s2">nested scales from a grassroots level up</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.659" end="01:13:03.909" style="s2">to a national scale sort of effort and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.969" end="01:13:05.619" style="s2">it happens it&#39;s manifested and expressed</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.909" end="01:13:08.230" style="s2">in all of these different ways right</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.619" end="01:13:10.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not always expressed</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.230" end="01:13:13.690" style="s2">in like an initiative on capacity</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.690" end="01:13:16.210" style="s2">building like it&#39;s we we organize</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.690" end="01:13:18.429" style="s2">ourselves around first principles and</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.210" end="01:13:20.409" style="s2">values as an alliance that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.429" end="01:13:22.300" style="s2">charter the Alliance that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.409" end="01:13:25.000" style="s2">Charter the working groups so that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.300" end="01:13:27.340" style="s2">organizing framework for each for our</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.000" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">for the culture that we develop within</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.340" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">each one of these teams is based on</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:34.929" style="s2">those first principles of building</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">capacity up and down nested scales and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.929" end="01:13:39.730" style="s2">that you know that&#39;s very rooted in</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:42.340" style="s2">learning and being open to new ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.730" end="01:13:46.690" style="s2">we actually have started saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.340" end="01:13:49.270" style="s2">explicitly that these groups are we we</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.690" end="01:13:52.210" style="s2">want to cultivate creative contributions</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.270" end="01:13:54.699" style="s2">rather than expert contributions right</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.210" end="01:13:58.030" style="s2">this is a create fundamentally creative</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.699" end="01:14:01.020" style="s2">process rather than an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.030" end="01:14:04.179" style="s2">share expertise not that expertise is</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.020" end="01:14:07.210" style="s2">you know not valid it absolutely has a</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.179" end="01:14:10.119" style="s2">place but when when we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.210" end="01:14:11.500" style="s2">creatively as a team that&#39;s when new</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.119" end="01:14:13.540" style="s2">thinking comes</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.500" end="01:14:15.420" style="s2">or word rather than getting stuck in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.540" end="01:14:18.340" style="s2">lot of sort of the old thinking patterns</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.420" end="01:14:21.340" style="s2">so anyway you you appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.340" end="01:14:23.170" style="s2">complexity of this work and nothing is</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.340" end="01:14:25.870" style="s2">perfect you know where we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.170" end="01:14:27.850" style="s2">working you know in 2018 when were</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.870" end="01:14:29.500" style="s2">involved in the inception and initial</p>

<p begin="01:14:50.020" end="01:14:55.980" style="s2">taking on some of the main sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.300" end="01:14:58.420" style="s2">topics that we care about such as</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.980" end="01:15:01.870" style="s2">regenerative sustainable agriculture</p>

<p begin="01:15:05.020" end="01:15:09.490" style="s2">is you know agroforestry reforestation</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.240" end="01:15:13.570" style="s2">and those sorts of things and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.490" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">this opportunity to link the common</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.020" end="01:15:46.480" style="s2">great didn&#39;t know that well we could go</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.710" end="01:15:48.640" style="s2">on for a long time but we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.480" end="01:15:51.070" style="s2">should wrap it up so even the most</p>

<p begin="01:15:59.020" end="01:16:01.830" style="s2">bit in that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.079" end="01:16:08.730" style="s2">the future ideal state a kind of line is</p>

<p begin="01:16:38.110" end="01:16:43.949" style="s2">wonderfully in the next five to ten</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.210" end="01:16:48.849" style="s2">years where would you see this process</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.949" end="01:16:50.349" style="s2">going to yeah well I think you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.849" end="01:16:53.679" style="s2">think you&#39;ll appreciate this that I I</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.349" end="01:16:58.300" style="s2">really value the culture that we create</p>
