<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">that I would like everybody here to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.130" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">is if if Jordan mare talking or Pugh and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:24.210" style="s2">I are talking like we we have this and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:27.390" style="s2">think we naturally have it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.210" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">making explicit is if you say something</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.390" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">that sounds ridiculous to me or batshit</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">crazy or wrong I actually give the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">benefit of the doubt that you might have</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">a reason that I didn&#39;t understand first</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">so rather than just default into you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">probably wrong</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">I&#39;ll ask more questions and and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">giving the benefit of the doubt that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">actually might have something useful to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">say increases my making sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">understand you before I&#39;m responding and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">that actually and the disagreeing was</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">something that you weren&#39;t even saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t seek to understand well</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">enough creates very turbulent flow</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">rather than laminar flow breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">coherence right if people could just do</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">that towards coherence if they could</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:19.430" style="s2">just give the benefit of the doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">each other that everyone has some signal</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.430" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">even if it&#39;s on a very different part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">reality than the part they&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:28.430" style="s2">and even if there&#39;s noise involved and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">they&#39;re listening for the signal first</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.430" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">that would change everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">that&#39;s a starting place so Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">expresses something and let&#39;s see he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">trying to express intense hard which by</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">the way the rule make is designed for</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">that kind of a thing like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:43.170" style="s2">interested in having conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually trying to break new</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">ground so okay do with you so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">expressing something hard and in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">expression ninety-eight percent is noise</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">and two percent is signal like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">chance riff but what happens is that my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">job is to actually do two things one</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">hold all of it not just say it that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">was that wasn&#39;t a hundred percent right</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna nuke it hold all of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">then in my self discernment to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">degree can i express something back that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">gets rid of the fifty fifty percent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:16.970" style="s2">is noise</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">so now I&#39;ve got 6% signal express it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.970" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">back and of course if he can then do</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:22.700" style="s2">that and now you three is even better a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:23.300" style="s2">more profound instrument because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.700" end="00:02:24.710" style="s2">gonna be bringing a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.300" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">perspective perhaps you can take it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.710" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">actually zoom in on it down to the poem</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.070" style="s2">you&#39;re actually 50% signal that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:32.570" style="s2">idea I and so one it&#39;s an invitation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.070" end="00:02:33.800" style="s2">say hey we&#39;re trying to do something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.570" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2">hard let&#39;s all try to do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.800" end="00:02:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to be willing to take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:46.670" style="s2">risk of not speaking elegantly and on</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.520" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">the premise that everyone else is doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.670" end="00:02:52.310" style="s2">their absolute level best to hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:54.350" style="s2">that which is trying to speak itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.310" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">through you and listening them is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.350" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">themselves like oh there it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:03:00.200" style="s2">tone got it there&#39;s something beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.130" end="00:03:02.260" style="s2">and clear there here&#39;s what I heard and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.200" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">that&#39;s for the Omega and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.260" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">psychological safety that&#39;s created to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:09.860" style="s2">be able to try out new stuff knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:11.390" style="s2">that we know we&#39;re trying out new stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.860" end="00:03:13.340" style="s2">we&#39;re giving the benefit of the doubt so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.390" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">it actually does become more explorative</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.340" end="00:03:17.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you get more novelty</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">and then I imagine I don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.390" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">is true for Daniel I imagine it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">for you but certainly if it&#39;s true for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:21.860" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.510" style="s2">is that I&#39;m also noticing myself like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.860" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">this constant you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.510" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">meditating you feel this this constant</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:29.269" style="s2">chatter and flow of like all the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.070" style="s2">that are going on internally that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.269" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">either like certain ideas are popping up</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.070" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">or emotional responses some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">like social emotional responses some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:40.100" style="s2">them are like just like I got a P and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:42.769" style="s2">like being able to actually notice all</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.100" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">that chatter internally and do the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.769" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">disturbing interior and say okay of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">that chatter which have a heart that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:50.030" style="s2">actually signal oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:51.590" style="s2">but listen to all of it you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.030" end="00:03:53.810" style="s2">you we&#39;re gonna make it goes in and out</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.590" end="00:03:56.090" style="s2">right I&#39;m listening to myself fully and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.810" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">I&#39;m listening to the to the others fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:04:00.310" style="s2">and trying to use discernment to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:05.269" style="s2">continuously allow that process to turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.310" end="00:04:07.970" style="s2">that into gold now there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.269" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">important distinction that we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.970" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">something that is different than the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">that some people think about multi</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">perspectivism which is we&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:23.240" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying all perspectives are</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">equally valid and I&#39;m also not saying</p>
