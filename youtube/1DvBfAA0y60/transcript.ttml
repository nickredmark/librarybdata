<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">about addiction and sort of in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">three-stage way</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">i tried to answer at length as best i</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">think help make the peritonic mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">salient is this just contemplation or is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">it more involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">so the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">uh get into the peritonic mode</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">autotellic and autotelic is basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">synonymous with peritolic so those</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">uh that get you into the flow state uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">will get you more and more aware of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">the peritonic mode in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">i think uh the flow state uh i remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">we talked about the flow state can</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">you know is on a continuum from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">you know mild to medium to intense but</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">all good</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">i think the flow state um is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">marker</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">of of that mode um because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">uh in which we are going through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">most developmental</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">uh change because that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">peritelic mode&#39;s about it&#39;s about where</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">we play</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">in order to develop as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">vitalik mode</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">where we work in order to survive</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">so i think any of the practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">that get you into the flow state of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">course they would be contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">uh but the movement practices can also</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">get you into that but many uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">have been created precisely because um</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">they generate the flow state playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">jazz</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">writing poetry all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">notice how a lot of these are the arts</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">and our work</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">obsessed workaholic culture that works</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">us to death for nothing other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">working so that we can continue to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">to make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">make it possible for other people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">has of course denigrated the arts</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">they though those principles that move</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">us in that way have forgotten those</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">principles and powers that move us that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">have forgotten the being mode modal</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">and they have forgotten how important</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">the serious play of art</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">is to remembering sati</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">the being mode remembering the peritonic</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">because that is the mode in which human</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">most activate their devel and actualize</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">their developmental potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">and thereby most afford their</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">growth so i think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">that we deepen and extend mark&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">into asking ourselves not only what are</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">the practices but how can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">incorporate more of them into our lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">in a more comprehensive and integrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">so uh karima cynthia clayton</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a question socrates and plato</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">taught that knowledge gained in past</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">lives is the basis for education in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">present life</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">what happened that the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">dropped the belief</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">um so it&#39;s not clear if socrates</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">believes that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">socrates in the apology very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">uh that he has no knowledge of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">um and um and that therefore he</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">should in no way fear it or hope for it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">plato of course is deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">the pythagoreans</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">and i agree with a lot of the research</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">that argues that the pythagoreans</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">were influenced by shamanism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">shamanism of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">has the idea of soul flight and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">reincarnation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">the epicureans drop it because they</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">are not as influenced by plato</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">they are more directly influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">and because they also have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">scientific bent of mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">they didn&#39;t think that the psyche the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">was immaterial they thought it was also</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">made up of atoms special kind of atom</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">and therefore like everything else made</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">of atoms it would dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">given enough time that caused them</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">problems of course with respect</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">to the existence and the immortality of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">the gods and the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">they give some of the first arguments in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">history for what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">atheism arguments the argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">often attributed to hume</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">you know if the gods are all powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">and all good why is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">evil actually originates with epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">so there was a questioning in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">epicureans of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">of what you might call the pythagorean</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">and shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">aspects that plato introduced in</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">um now neoplatonism uh does follow uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">those aspects neoplatonism picks up</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">uh the ideas of rebir reincarnation past</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">and such but that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">historical answer to your question</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">karima</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">i&#39;m not accusing anybody of anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">we have to break the frame of monologue</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">so that we become genuinely open to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">and trust that our relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">in fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">better in dialogue and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">i know that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">i&#39;m asking you to trust and to try</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">but what i can say is um</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">i have good reason and confidence to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">that if you make this move you will find</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">uh deeply rewarding kiera kroger in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">practice i noticed a deep sadness at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">loss of the daily</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">meditation classes i i know kara we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">we we struggled to try i i</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">we are all felt very responsible to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">and we we&#39;ve tried many times uh you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">know i just tried to find intersections</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">we were thinking of doing some evening</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">i just just can&#39;t get it to work</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">and so i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">that i will still</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">be able to answer a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">uh give you some reliable sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">of my presence</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">in your lives as a teacher and mentor</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">with the saturday morning dharma class</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">switching more to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">you know uh you know the synagogue</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">temple mosque</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">church model where we meet once a week</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">time and always there&#39;s always some</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">dharma</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">and so that has worked for people</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">obviously in many contexts across many</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">within many religious frameworks this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">not a religious framework but</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">you understand the analogy i i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">and so i&#39;m hoping that will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">work and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">am hoping and i&#39;m encouraged by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">by the belief that uh the discord server</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">can take</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">over the function of homing uh the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">weekly senga</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">and giving a place where people can</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">review the lessons all of the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">are are recorded</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">people can still meet they can still</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">review they can still practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">there&#39;s no real reason for the weekly</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">meetings to stop</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to do my best to try and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">maintain perhaps not as extensive but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">a significant presence as a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">mentor</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">for the sangha so i share your sadness</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">it has can it has been very nourishing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">and meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">but um we</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">this is the best we the best response</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">so remi remember the rest of the week is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">as normal</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">i hope not i hope that these things can</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">are progressing</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">uh quite well in canada um</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think things are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">back to the way they were before covet</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a false hope</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">but i do think we&#39;re going through yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">another transition and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">work out</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">a new way of being and so i ask</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">everybody to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">and i ask you to trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">in the practices</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">that we have shared together and learned</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">to affording your capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">and adaptivity as we go through yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">another phase</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">together and we will be going through it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">together we&#39;re not going away</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to be differently</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">present</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">really hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">this new technology working that way</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">when we switch</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">the dharma classes we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">cut between cameras and record that for</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">make that available we won&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">the weird move moving of the camera and</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">and so that should hopefully make</p>
