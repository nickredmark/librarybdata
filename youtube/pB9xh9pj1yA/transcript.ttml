<p begin="00:02:32.920" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">Jenny berry Bai Rd just fabulous stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.510" end="00:02:44.990" style="s2">in her gallery so okay so what have we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:46.910" style="s2">been doing we started with deep clothes</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:51.460" style="s2">what&#39;s starting what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.910" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">is as clearly and simply as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.460" end="00:02:57.080" style="s2">understand ourselves the way we make</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:59.420" style="s2">meaning the way we make sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.080" end="00:03:03.770" style="s2">we started with deep cold which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.420" end="00:03:07.580" style="s2">unpacked these large concepts such as</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.770" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">power and trust so that was one way to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.580" end="00:03:13.480" style="s2">take complexity and kind of get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:17.810" style="s2">wrap wrapped some conversation around it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">and then we started doing actually some</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.810" end="00:03:27.290" style="s2">interior work some phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:29.239" style="s2">asking ourselves what&#39;s what&#39;s under the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.290" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2">hood like how does this work so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.239" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">worked with in her talk and we looked</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.620" end="00:03:40.100" style="s2">carefully at what inner talk how inner</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:43.880" style="s2">talk is composed what is it composed of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.100" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">and this consideration consideration we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.880" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">got to was that inner talk is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">sub-threshold micro actions of talk that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:04:02.420" style="s2">when that happens when I say water and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">if I have a sub-threshold action little</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.420" end="00:04:08.920" style="s2">bit action electricity that pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:13.600" style="s2">my my jaw and my mouth and my tongue the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.920" end="00:04:15.590" style="s2">perceptual function of my brain has</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.600" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2">anticipates that it comes with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.590" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2">sound water so it completes it down</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:24.490" style="s2">retro actively someone said it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:28.640" style="s2">burning a CD it completes the other side</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.490" end="00:04:31.580" style="s2">so we likened it to burning a CD we also</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.640" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">likened it to this notion of well what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">burns in her top and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">well if I have if I if I close my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:46.700" style="s2">and I imagine raising my right</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:48.790" style="s2">hand right okay I can I can recreate</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.700" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">that in my imagination and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.790" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">foundational experience that enables me</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:04:57.169" style="s2">to recreate that it&#39;s raising my right</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:05:00.830" style="s2">hand so the same thing the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.169" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">experience that Prime&#39;s the organism for</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.830" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">inner talk is actual talk in actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">speech we also made a analogy about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:14.840" style="s2">phantom limb syndrome right because</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:18.620" style="s2">certain intentions always come with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:21.979" style="s2">certain feeling then if I have my limbs</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.620" end="00:05:24.410" style="s2">severed I can in fact have the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.979" end="00:05:27.650" style="s2">that I&#39;m moving my arm because these</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.410" end="00:05:30.830" style="s2">things what we call covary so your whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.650" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">life there&#39;s certain things that almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:40.580" style="s2">100% Kovach can you can expect something</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">almost 100% coming from those things so</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.580" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">when I say water I can expect that sound</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:51.140" style="s2">watch her coming from those things if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:52.970" style="s2">say water I can expect the death coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.140" end="00:05:57.380" style="s2">from the feeling of my tongue doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.970" end="00:06:00.050" style="s2">and this is how we teach or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.380" end="00:06:04.700" style="s2">teach but people can teach people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.050" end="00:06:07.070" style="s2">are deaf to speak because they you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">investigate with your hands what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.070" end="00:06:12.710" style="s2">mouth is doing and you do that the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">and the breath and even though they</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.710" end="00:06:18.650" style="s2">can&#39;t hear themselves they can speak and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">this is also why when we start to lose</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.650" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">our hearing we can read lips</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">because of these near mirror neurons so</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:35.350" style="s2">this is also part of why people can read</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:38.270" style="s2">minds so you can do an experiment where</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.350" end="00:06:43.669" style="s2">let&#39;s say I give someone a card and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.270" end="00:06:46.729" style="s2">has the word water sky and ambulance</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.669" end="00:06:49.970" style="s2">okay so those are quite different in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.729" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">terms of their sounds and I have like</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.970" end="00:06:56.380" style="s2">what and the person has a card and picks</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:59.920" style="s2">one of those cards so websites and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.380" end="00:07:01.570" style="s2">and I asked them to say the word in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.920" end="00:07:04.930" style="s2">their head without moving their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.570" end="00:07:06.940" style="s2">and then I asked them to spell it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:10.030" style="s2">their head without moving their mouths</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:12.700" style="s2">and I have someone watching them I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.030" end="00:07:15.310" style="s2">get a better than 30% a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.700" end="00:07:18.100" style="s2">predictability that the person can tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.310" end="00:07:21.070" style="s2">what word is in the person&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.100" end="00:07:25.290" style="s2">because very very subtly there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.070" end="00:07:30.940" style="s2">mirror neurons and you&#39;re subconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.290" end="00:07:34.510" style="s2">picking up on very subtle cues in the in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:39.340" style="s2">the context right so this is like a game</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.510" end="00:07:41.230" style="s2">that some of some some people play you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.340" end="00:07:44.590" style="s2">know you hear Dan Brown and people say</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.230" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2">you know my guru my mentor he could read</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:47.740" style="s2">my mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:49.870" style="s2">part of it is picking up on these subtle</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.740" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">cues but also understanding that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.870" end="00:07:58.450" style="s2">something quite a lot of patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">compose compose people and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.450" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">teacher understands not only there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:05.410" style="s2">patterns but there are certain stages</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:10.270" style="s2">that people are in so they can guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.410" end="00:08:13.330" style="s2">pretty well what kind of package package</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.270" end="00:08:15.700" style="s2">you&#39;re in so we&#39;re just trying to play</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.330" end="00:08:20.500" style="s2">around with touching base on some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.700" end="00:08:25.750" style="s2">these so what would be a next step what</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.500" end="00:08:30.480" style="s2">would be a next step to investigating</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:35.770" style="s2">what&#39;s under the hood let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:39.669" style="s2">emotions and let&#39;s try to get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.770" end="00:08:44.650" style="s2">on what the literature on emotions is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.669" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">highly is messy so you have emotions you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.650" end="00:08:53.530" style="s2">have the word feeling feelings and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:58.450" style="s2">the literature unfortunately in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.530" end="00:09:01.060" style="s2">literature unfortunately some people use</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.450" end="00:09:03.100" style="s2">the word feelings in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.060" end="00:09:06.100" style="s2">emotions in another way and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.100" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">authors use it in the opposite way so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.100" end="00:09:12.570" style="s2">like DiMaggio</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:15.870" style="s2">and I think pants that use them the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.570" end="00:09:18.090" style="s2">other way so first of all if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.870" end="00:09:22.050" style="s2">reading the literature this is maybe why</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.090" end="00:09:25.170" style="s2">you&#39;re confused so just to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.050" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">that you understand when you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.170" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">the literature which which way is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">author using this and if it&#39;s transposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">from another author than in your mind to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:38.339" style="s2">compare the two you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">do that semantic mapping but work for</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.339" end="00:09:48.390" style="s2">our purposes then we are going to agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:48.900" style="s2">on defining these things in a specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.390" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.900" end="00:09:58.850" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to use the word feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2">as bodily sensation I feel hot I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.850" end="00:10:06.630" style="s2">yeah I feel hot I feel like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.000" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">get a stomachache I feel butterflies in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.630" end="00:10:11.430" style="s2">my stomach I feel how this is soft</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:14.190" style="s2">everything is really more in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.430" end="00:10:18.120" style="s2">bodily sensation so that&#39;s how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.190" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">gonna use the term feeling and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.120" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use this term effect an</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:27.330" style="s2">effect yep</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">okay yep very close so ethics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.330" end="00:10:35.160" style="s2">gonna say is more subtle than feelings</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:39.180" style="s2">and we&#39;re not gonna get into this today</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.160" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">but in my work I&#39;m map it onto jack</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:46.350" style="s2">pants Epps 6at well there&#39;s seven</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.380" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">effects dreams they can become making</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.350" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">and Jean Russell showed that they come</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:55.140" style="s2">in pairs so there&#39;s there&#39;s three pairs</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:59.660" style="s2">of effects dreams and then another one</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.140" end="00:11:03.420" style="s2">so what we mean by ethics are this</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:06.420" style="s2">something changes in my body okay the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.420" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">word feeling means I can feel something</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.420" end="00:11:16.709" style="s2">in my body I&#39;m conscious of it okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:19.650" style="s2">effect is is whether I&#39;m aware of it or</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.709" end="00:11:21.699" style="s2">not so my heart rate might go up or down</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.650" end="00:11:23.559" style="s2">it could be so subtle I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.699" end="00:11:26.259" style="s2">aware of it you know tiny little murmur</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.559" end="00:11:29.189" style="s2">ations my adrenaline levels all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.259" end="00:11:32.109" style="s2">neuro cocktails are constantly changing</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.189" end="00:11:35.109" style="s2">my vagus nerves constantly processing</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.109" end="00:11:39.369" style="s2">information my pupils may delay to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.109" end="00:11:43.389" style="s2">contract some nerves become tense others</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.369" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">become relaxed there&#39;s so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.389" end="00:11:48.790" style="s2">we&#39;re going to call effect it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">kind of interior almost yet static or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.790" end="00:11:56.859" style="s2">responsive mode our state or state of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">intention how my body is primed in any</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.859" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">given moment right so I don&#39;t know no</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:05.230" style="s2">they&#39;re different than feelings because</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:07.419" style="s2">I&#39;m not necessarily aware of them I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:12.249" style="s2">train myself to be more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.419" end="00:12:16.449" style="s2">them but an effect is that and pANSA cap</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.249" end="00:12:19.059" style="s2">uses this notion of effect because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.449" end="00:12:23.499" style="s2">way it works in our body is consistent</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.059" end="00:12:27.939" style="s2">with all mammals okay so those that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.499" end="00:12:31.869" style="s2">feeling after and now emotions so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.939" end="00:12:37.239" style="s2">going to say an emotion is an effect</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.869" end="00:12:39.579" style="s2">plus a story okay so some kind of we</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.239" end="00:12:41.379" style="s2">talked about other stories like some</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.579" end="00:12:43.809" style="s2">kind of mental model we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.379" end="00:12:47.379" style="s2">which the energy comes up and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.809" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">reproduces a mental model of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.379" end="00:12:57.009" style="s2">of the mental model can become a story</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:13:00.220" style="s2">in your head yeah so an emotion is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.009" end="00:13:03.100" style="s2">effect plus a story now let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.220" end="00:13:06.999" style="s2">an example of what I mean we know in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.100" end="00:13:10.149" style="s2">early childhood when a child falls down</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.999" end="00:13:13.689" style="s2">right a child will fall down in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.149" end="00:13:15.609" style="s2">body their body since their body effects</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.689" end="00:13:18.039" style="s2">will change their adrenaline will go up</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.609" end="00:13:21.910" style="s2">they might have a startle response right</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.039" end="00:13:25.119" style="s2">this is very easy but they turn to their</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.910" end="00:13:29.410" style="s2">primary caregiver to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.119" end="00:13:32.739" style="s2">will effective tone to put that in to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.410" end="00:13:34.179" style="s2">put that with it&#39;s just at first just</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.739" end="00:13:35.350" style="s2">something that&#39;s happening in their body</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.179" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">they turn to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.350" end="00:13:40.570" style="s2">who&#39;s ever taking care of them and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">look for a marker and if that if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.570" end="00:13:44.010" style="s2">fall down and bump your knee and your</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.220" end="00:13:47.890" style="s2">mother is scared</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.010" end="00:13:51.640" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna couple this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.890" end="00:13:55.930" style="s2">threat to those kinds of bodily</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.640" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">sensations if your mother goes oh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.930" end="00:14:06.310" style="s2">see are you all right then you a couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:10.390" style="s2">that with curiosity so that&#39;s what so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.310" end="00:14:12.820" style="s2">that&#39;s so so this is a many of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.390" end="00:14:15.880" style="s2">curiosity becomes stories or the threat</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.820" end="00:14:18.310" style="s2">becomes stories but the actual body</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.880" end="00:14:22.060" style="s2">sensation is neutral to a story the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.310" end="00:14:26.460" style="s2">effect is neutral to the story in those</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.060" end="00:14:30.340" style="s2">ways so let me give you another example</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.460" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">and this is where I wish pants got</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.340" end="00:14:37.830" style="s2">hadn&#39;t used these words one of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:44.260" style="s2">primary effects streams he calls fear</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.830" end="00:14:47.170" style="s2">now when it when he investigates that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.260" end="00:14:49.870" style="s2">certain things happen your adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.170" end="00:14:51.970" style="s2">levels go up your you know your</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.870" end="00:14:54.220" style="s2">parasympathetic and your neuro</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.970" end="00:14:58.840" style="s2">sympathetic and your vagus nerves your</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.220" end="00:15:02.860" style="s2">pupils open up some muscles contract</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.840" end="00:15:05.230" style="s2">some relax this is exactly what happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.860" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">to a deer when it&#39;s in the woods and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.230" end="00:15:11.320" style="s2">hears something but for the deer it</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:13.390" style="s2">Prime&#39;s them for action they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.320" end="00:15:15.670" style="s2">sitting there like shuddering oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.390" end="00:15:19.060" style="s2">like we think they are we project that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.670" end="00:15:24.210" style="s2">onto them so the very same kind of neuro</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.060" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">chemical electrochemical effect Laden</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.210" end="00:15:30.610" style="s2">body response is in the deer who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:34.060" style="s2">primed to run in a sense in their power</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.610" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">and into you but then when you add your</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.060" end="00:15:40.680" style="s2">story of threat or worried it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:40.680" style="s2">fear in the human sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.130" end="00:15:49.610" style="s2">and this is why when you&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.590" end="00:15:54.080" style="s2">people you as coaches you want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.610" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">to what is actually your body doing try</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.080" end="00:16:01.820" style="s2">to move from the story now just like we</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:06.550" style="s2">have downward causation and inner talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:09.950" style="s2">and phantom limb eventually the story</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.550" end="00:16:13.550" style="s2">can downwardly cause the body to change</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.950" end="00:16:22.970" style="s2">its effect configuration now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.550" end="00:16:27.290" style="s2"> now you&#39;re really so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.970" end="00:16:34.910" style="s2">is why what we want to really try to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.290" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">is be have you know try to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.910" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">out of the habit of the story affects</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:44.630" style="s2">like everything else in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:51.560" style="s2">they come and they go and they take the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.630" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">time they take some of you may have</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.560" end="00:16:59.000" style="s2">noticed especially I mean I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">this is kind of hyper this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.000" end="00:17:05.480" style="s2">stereotypical but you know when you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:07.459" style="s2">know get interesting I&#39;d be interested</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.480" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">in a male version of the same story but</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.459" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">when you have when you&#39;re a young woman</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:17.540" style="s2">and you have your period menstrual cycle</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:20.689" style="s2">you noticed how your ethics are changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.540" end="00:17:24.680" style="s2">and you learn not to interpret the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.689" end="00:17:27.020" style="s2">from the fact that you&#39;re you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.680" end="00:17:29.570" style="s2">threat response all the time when I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.020" end="00:17:32.780" style="s2">my hysterectomy I got very Acorah phobic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.570" end="00:17:34.670" style="s2">it was like oh my god it was gonna rain</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.780" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">when these people were coming on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.670" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">weekend and I was sitting there in bed</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:40.760" style="s2">going like what if it rains and all this</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">threat response would come and it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.760" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">just because my my hormones were all</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.550" end="00:17:48.800" style="s2">messed up and so you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:51.770" style="s2">learned the if you have erratic hormones</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.800" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">at certain times to get the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.770" end="00:17:56.690" style="s2">are served up it&#39;s so obviously out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:59.269" style="s2">sync with the reality</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:42.259" style="s2">very fundamental to animal nature it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.710" end="00:19:44.359" style="s2">very primordial it separates the plants</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.259" end="00:19:48.979" style="s2">from the animals that we seek and move</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.359" end="00:19:50.539" style="s2">okay so G this woman Russell I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.979" end="00:19:53.149" style="s2">it&#39;s Dianne Russell she noticed</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.539" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">something interesting she noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.149" end="00:20:00.919" style="s2">the seeking and the fear had the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:03.559" style="s2">quality of energy but one was more</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.919" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">expanded than the other and she talks</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.559" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">you call these the tremulous energies</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:10.550" style="s2">you know when we&#39;re seeking for</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:14.060" style="s2">something if we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.550" end="00:20:16.670" style="s2">these these piece that these that sci-fi</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.060" end="00:20:19.160" style="s2">these horror movies where the woman is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.670" end="00:20:20.810" style="s2">gonna like open the door and she hears</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.160" end="00:20:24.910" style="s2">all this horrible stuff on the other</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.910" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">eaten by the aliens or something this</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.680" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">this is a good portal to understand her</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:34.610" style="s2">notion of seeking she calls a tremulous</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:37.400" style="s2">energies when you&#39;re seeking something</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.610" end="00:20:40.850" style="s2">it has this notion of excitement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.400" end="00:20:43.580" style="s2">like fear and then she says and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.850" end="00:20:45.560" style="s2">when you&#39;re contracted and studies are</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.580" end="00:20:47.720" style="s2">now she&#39;s looking for studies that show</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.560" end="00:20:50.810" style="s2">the seeking and the fear have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.720" end="00:20:52.760" style="s2">vague vagal tone because but at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.810" end="00:20:56.390" style="s2">of seeking there&#39;s a boundary between</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.760" end="00:20:59.090" style="s2">seeking and fear so when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.390" end="00:21:02.300" style="s2">for something and so as a coach what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.090" end="00:21:05.780" style="s2">work with is Isis is when I see if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.300" end="00:21:08.810" style="s2">working with fear you move it you say</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.780" end="00:21:12.110" style="s2">it&#39;s in the same direction as seeking so</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.810" end="00:21:14.300" style="s2">you always move fear to curiosity well</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.110" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look maybe that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.300" end="00:21:19.040" style="s2">case do we really understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">government is saying do we really</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.040" end="00:21:25.250" style="s2">believe this conspiracy theory we always</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:31.340" style="s2">take fear and move it toward curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.250" end="00:21:35.210" style="s2">or seeking there&#39;s the same relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.340" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">between care and panic panic is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.210" end="00:21:42.290" style="s2">experience of losing some someone or</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:45.170" style="s2">something you care for so the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.290" end="00:21:47.720" style="s2">panic at separation anxiety right and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.170" end="00:21:50.390" style="s2">know this is very close when you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.720" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">your first crush you really care for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.390" end="00:21:54.170" style="s2">person and you&#39;re like on the phone like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">24 hours a day to make sure you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.170" end="00:22:01.540" style="s2">gonna lose them right so this notion</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:04.280" style="s2">between panic care and panic this is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.540" end="00:22:07.690" style="s2">great exercise if you&#39;re like me and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.280" end="00:22:10.130" style="s2">take care of orphaned wild animals</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.690" end="00:22:12.770" style="s2">because you care for them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.130" end="00:22:14.770" style="s2">have to let them be wild animals and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.770" end="00:22:18.890" style="s2">you&#39;re so afraid that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.770" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">gonna be eaten you know so she talks</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.890" end="00:22:24.259" style="s2">about how she calls care and panic the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:30.899" style="s2">connection energy</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.259" end="00:22:34.700" style="s2">the connection energies and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.899" end="00:22:37.499" style="s2">interesting is again as a coach and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.700" end="00:22:40.919" style="s2">instead of moving people around if</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.499" end="00:22:45.389" style="s2">they&#39;re panicked about you know being</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.919" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">abandoned or separations you lead them</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.389" end="00:22:50.580" style="s2">to where that shows them that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:53.279" style="s2">really care if they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.580" end="00:23:00.840" style="s2">something because it&#39;s in the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.279" end="00:23:05.789" style="s2">stream does that make sense we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.840" end="00:23:09.059" style="s2">get to rage I know and then play and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.789" end="00:23:10.919" style="s2">anger the same thing it&#39;s like watching</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.059" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">my used to have these two big Murray</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.919" end="00:23:14.840" style="s2">mushy dogs their guard chief and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.759" style="s2">very territorial and they would play</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.840" end="00:23:20.009" style="s2">they would play me playing the older one</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.759" end="00:23:23.999" style="s2">had a bad back and as soon as she got</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.009" end="00:23:26.789" style="s2">hurt she just like the play turned into</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.999" end="00:23:30.359" style="s2">anger so there&#39;s like there is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.789" end="00:23:37.519" style="s2">very close between anger and play the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.359" end="00:23:41.190" style="s2">contracted form of play is anger so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.519" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">there&#39;s that so they&#39;re there again so</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.190" end="00:23:45.659" style="s2">when someone&#39;s angry you try to move</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:47.789" style="s2">that toward playing we see this all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.659" end="00:23:50.249" style="s2">time in the martial arts in sports that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.789" end="00:23:52.679" style="s2">boundary right between my sister and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.249" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">used to play this game where we would</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.679" end="00:23:56.519" style="s2">take brushes this is America it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:58.950" style="s2">recently and we would hit each other on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.519" end="00:24:00.840" style="s2">the leg and it would be playful with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.950" end="00:24:03.330" style="s2">little bit of bite you know and then all</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.840" end="00:24:05.820" style="s2">of a sudden it would get it return it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.330" end="00:24:08.340" style="s2">return and you&#39;d get angry right so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.820" end="00:24:11.249" style="s2">notion between clay and angries about</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.340" end="00:24:17.879" style="s2">boundaries so anger is the contracted</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.249" end="00:24:21.090" style="s2">form of play so you can work with them</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.879" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">as three effect streams and of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.090" end="00:24:30.629" style="s2">what moves them into contracted forms is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:33.960" style="s2">often a story right so you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.629" end="00:24:37.289" style="s2">your very playful with someone and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.960" end="00:24:39.149" style="s2">your energy or the capacity turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.289" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">contracted form and then you&#39;re like he</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.149" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">was aggressive or he would think he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:46.679" style="s2">mean or it&#39;s his fault and you start you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:49.649" style="s2">start justifying that that switch with</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.679" end="00:24:51.149" style="s2">these stories instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.649" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">understanding that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.149" end="00:24:57.539" style="s2">there&#39;s this toggle at the edge of how</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:25:02.340" style="s2">much energy you know these these energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.539" end="00:25:04.380" style="s2">signatures and we all have to work we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.340" end="00:25:06.539" style="s2">all have instances of working on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.380" end="00:25:09.029" style="s2">consciously like when you&#39;re a mother</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.539" end="00:25:11.850" style="s2">and your child is starting to grow up</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.029" end="00:25:15.029" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly toggling that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.850" end="00:25:18.059" style="s2">you want to care for them and support</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.029" end="00:25:19.500" style="s2">that but you can feel your panic you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.059" end="00:25:21.570" style="s2">don&#39;t want them to get their first</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.500" end="00:25:24.690" style="s2">driver&#39;s license you don&#39;t want them to</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.690" end="00:25:31.770" style="s2">not good to keep falling into the</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.770" end="00:25:44.340" style="s2">close that&#39;s okay so now there&#39;s an even</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.340" end="00:25:52.110" style="s2">these situations so seeking is the</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.059" end="00:28:39.629" style="s2">that energy signature if that you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.210" end="00:28:44.580" style="s2">an energy signature now the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.629" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">thing is most people can identify what</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.580" end="00:28:50.099" style="s2">their energy signature where their</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">energy sitting there most lies upon like</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.099" end="00:29:01.530" style="s2">what is most mostly their signature yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:05.010" style="s2">so yes that just as an aside the seventh</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.530" end="00:29:10.710" style="s2">stream and pan escapes ethics is lust</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.010" end="00:29:13.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.710" end="00:29:16.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.890" end="00:29:19.470" style="s2">see if it follows the same matrix that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.470" end="00:29:21.080" style="s2">was set up by Diane muscle but I&#39;m kind</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.080" end="00:29:28.980" style="s2">established established science let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.190" end="00:29:30.660" style="s2">say so I&#39;m just I&#39;m following that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.980" end="00:29:32.310" style="s2">little a little bit I do have a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.660" end="00:29:37.350" style="s2">I talk about less but it&#39;s kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.310" end="00:29:39.540" style="s2">up it&#39;s not not not in not in line with</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.350" end="00:29:44.430" style="s2">the way it&#39;s it&#39;s being used in these</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.540" end="00:29:47.220" style="s2">methodologies so but okay you know some</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.430" end="00:29:50.520" style="s2">most people can find where they spend</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.220" end="00:29:52.380" style="s2">most of time in like they spend a lot if</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.520" end="00:29:54.180" style="s2">their energy is free do they spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.380" end="00:29:56.610" style="s2">of time carrying when they&#39;re contracted</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.180" end="00:30:02.220" style="s2">and they come toward anxiety of pink and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.610" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">panic or are you a seeking person who</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.220" end="00:30:06.300" style="s2">throws yourself out there but then that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:11.370" style="s2">means you take a lot of risk and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.300" end="00:30:13.740" style="s2">you&#39;re always working with risk and or</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:17.220" style="s2">are you someone who&#39;s very playful and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.740" end="00:30:20.190" style="s2">needs to play a lot and very sporty but</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:26.780" style="s2">gets angry a lot and has the potential</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.190" end="00:30:29.490" style="s2">for rage so there&#39;s there&#39;s many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.780" end="00:30:30.780" style="s2">maybe not this group because I work</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.490" end="00:30:34.160" style="s2">mostly with people who are highly</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.780" end="00:30:37.560" style="s2">nuanced personalities but in general</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.160" end="00:30:40.290" style="s2">there is an energy signature in most</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.560" end="00:30:44.360" style="s2">people that tends to spend most of its</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.290" end="00:30:44.360" style="s2">time and in one of those streams</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.210" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">what is the relationship between energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.679" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">signature and personality okay from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:31:02.009" style="s2">Taoist perspective they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:06.299" style="s2">very close because we try not to import</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.009" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">too many stories a caricatures or a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.299" end="00:31:11.539" style="s2">language around energy signature we try</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:16.139" style="s2">just to work with the energy signature</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.539" end="00:31:18.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very strong when</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.139" end="00:31:21.509" style="s2">you can work with at this level with</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.450" end="00:31:23.730" style="s2">either coaching or a business or in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.509" end="00:31:26.580" style="s2">own life there&#39;s a lot of leverage point</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.730" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">the deeper you can get it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.580" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">simple I mean I only have like nine</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:37.049" style="s2">boxes but it requires a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:42.330" style="s2">practice and sensitivity and settle</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.049" end="00:31:44.970" style="s2">sensing right but it&#39;s very powerful so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.330" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">and again in my work we started this I</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.970" end="00:31:48.629" style="s2">think the very first day I explained to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:52.580" style="s2">you that all my works about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.629" end="00:31:55.320" style="s2">take huge amount of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.580" end="00:31:57.269" style="s2">trying to get at these fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.320" end="00:32:00.929" style="s2">leverage points that are simple but</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.269" end="00:32:03.720" style="s2">powerful ways to make progress either as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.929" end="00:32:11.090" style="s2">a coach on a spiritual path or in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.720" end="00:32:14.519" style="s2">life or whatever you&#39;re trying to do and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.090" end="00:32:19.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve worked with very complex I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.519" end="00:32:24.299" style="s2">say egos and really I find it very</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.889" end="00:32:26.639" style="s2">helpful just to keep with the basis so</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.299" end="00:32:30.990" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see you&#39;ll feel you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.639" end="00:32:35.129" style="s2">hear your client or go into all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.990" end="00:32:36.870" style="s2">stories and you&#39;ll feel the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.129" end="00:32:38.970" style="s2">to follow them into the story but</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.870" end="00:32:41.159" style="s2">basically you&#39;re wondering where they</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.970" end="00:32:44.750" style="s2">toggling are they talking calmly between</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.159" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">seeking and fear and how can I then move</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.750" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">from the fear to the seeking or</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.159" end="00:32:51.779" style="s2">highlight the attractor toward the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">seeking so that&#39;s all I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.779" end="00:32:58.669" style="s2">care about the story or care about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:33:01.950" style="s2">personality I&#39;m always just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.669" end="00:33:04.020" style="s2">allow first allow the energy to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.950" end="00:33:06.930" style="s2">understand that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.020" end="00:33:09.750" style="s2">panic then you have what it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.930" end="00:33:12.540" style="s2">care deeply right it&#39;s in this you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.750" end="00:33:14.700" style="s2">the tool already you don&#39;t I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.540" end="00:33:17.400" style="s2">to put something else in there if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.700" end="00:33:19.980" style="s2">have a lot of Rage I see the potential</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.400" end="00:33:23.670" style="s2">for great mastery in you because I see</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.070" style="s2">it in the same direction so I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.670" end="00:33:28.380" style="s2">to repress that it&#39;s energy for free its</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.070" end="00:33:32.310" style="s2">energy that I but I that I want to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.380" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">for if you listen if you davon blue</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.310" end="00:33:41.640" style="s2">what&#39;s how big Gotham Oh some some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:46.040" style="s2">you might know him he created a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.640" end="00:33:49.590" style="s2">technology called intensive short-term</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.040" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">short-term intensive dynamic theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.590" end="00:33:55.470" style="s2">it&#39;s has to do with intensive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:58.140" style="s2">short-term he worked with a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:34:02.600" style="s2">serial killers and really sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.140" end="00:34:05.520" style="s2">that had a lot of rage and he showed how</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.600" end="00:34:08.220" style="s2">energetically the rage has to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.520" end="00:34:12.870" style="s2">expressed before it can move into anger</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.220" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">and then beyond so a lot of what we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.870" end="00:34:25.050" style="s2">in schools today is we&#39;re so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:27.870" style="s2">so conditioned that anger is bad that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.050" end="00:34:30.690" style="s2">should not appear that it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.870" end="00:34:33.270" style="s2">place in public space that we constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.690" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">repressed that and unfortunately it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.270" end="00:34:40.190" style="s2">bad we even repress ruffhouse play in</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">public space and pants gap has proved</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.190" end="00:34:46.260" style="s2">his research shows this is part of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:49.640" style="s2">gets a phrenic nature of children today</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.260" end="00:34:55.730" style="s2">and boys are hot at higher risk for this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.640" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">so to me we can meet a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.730" end="00:35:00.300" style="s2">psychology whole lot of theory but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:02.670" style="s2">think that ultimately at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.300" end="00:35:05.340" style="s2">day you know working with some simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.670" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">but powerful parts of the human</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.900" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">are the same someone came to my house</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:59.450" style="s2">just the other day she</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:36:02.430" style="s2">it&#39;s very sad she adopted this lovely</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.450" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">Staffordshire Terrier pit bull terrier</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.430" end="00:36:09.540" style="s2">as a child as a puppy it&#39;s seven months</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.630" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">old now it&#39;s like this with her I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.540" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a beautiful relationship but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:18.950" style="s2">so territorial to this woman that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:21.180" style="s2">attacks everything that comes around her</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.950" end="00:36:23.940" style="s2">and so they wanted to see if I could</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.180" end="00:36:25.770" style="s2">work with the dog and I had to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.940" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">it was not something that I could work</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.770" end="00:36:35.640" style="s2">with and so this is a case of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:41.330" style="s2">some of this deep in flexibility in some</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.640" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">of some of these energies energies and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.330" end="00:36:48.840" style="s2">of course even an aspect tone that set</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:51.870" style="s2">very early on is subject to quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.840" end="00:36:56.460" style="s2">of flexibility even as adults we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.870" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">lot of neuroplasticity he gets easier in</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.460" end="00:37:00.210" style="s2">the case yeah well that&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.430" style="s2">interesting that Eric you said that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.210" end="00:37:05.550" style="s2">required we were talking about what kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.430" end="00:37:10.380" style="s2">of person could work with that dog and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.550" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">it really requires someone of that again</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:17.850" style="s2">it certain kind of energy signature so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">for me it was I have a lovely dog who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.850" end="00:37:25.650" style="s2">not dominant and his male I took like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:29.090" style="s2">wanted to see if I could socialize it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.650" end="00:37:30.930" style="s2">her to him and it wasn&#39;t gonna happen so</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.090" end="00:37:37.079" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.930" end="00:37:40.740" style="s2">so now this is the nine boxes now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.079" end="00:37:44.520" style="s2">going to map the nine boxes on to more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.740" end="00:37:48.930" style="s2">of a spiritual kind of formulation how</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.520" end="00:37:52.950" style="s2">does this relate to spirituality so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.930" end="00:38:00.480" style="s2">have the tremulous energies which are</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.950" end="00:38:05.819" style="s2">seeking fear and dread we have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:10.260" style="s2">connection energies which are Care panic</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.819" end="00:38:16.500" style="s2">and grief and we have the mastery</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.260" end="00:38:20.760" style="s2">energies which are play anger and rage</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.500" end="00:38:22.530" style="s2">and then you know I think I&#39;ll add at</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.760" end="00:38:26.730" style="s2">some point then we have a tantric</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.530" end="00:38:29.540" style="s2">energies I found a place for lust in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.730" end="00:38:32.099" style="s2">nature so yeah so that&#39;s cool thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">yeah you have to go somewhere else and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.099" end="00:38:36.990" style="s2">we do talk about it but I haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.900" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">set it out in my matrix here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.990" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">then we have the tantric and energies I</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.920" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">believe so what I think love is I just</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.380" end="00:38:51.809" style="s2">might answer it I&#39;m gonna call the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">tantric energies they are all those</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.809" end="00:38:59.180" style="s2">other things trying to be reflected onto</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:39:04.740" style="s2">another so they intensify right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.180" end="00:39:07.849" style="s2">microcosmic orbit between people so care</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.740" end="00:39:10.410" style="s2">I can make a court cosmically orbit care</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.849" end="00:39:13.619" style="s2">with you and the connection and build</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.410" end="00:39:16.170" style="s2">this this notion of connection mastery</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.619" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">same thing there&#39;s a kind of lustfulness</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.170" end="00:39:20.270" style="s2">and kind of like what are the two tennis</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.150" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.270" end="00:39:25.980" style="s2">damar your back and the other guy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.150" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">like there&#39;s a bromance happening there</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.980" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">so I think lust is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.349" style="s2">applied to all of those it&#39;s a context</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">of new context for all of those to play</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.349" end="00:39:38.700" style="s2">in a certain way but that&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:41.549" style="s2">story this is not part of any</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.700" end="00:39:44.770" style="s2">established truth okay so we call them</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.549" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">the tantric under energies now</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.770" end="00:39:52.119" style="s2">I think there are spiritual forms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.230" end="00:39:56.859" style="s2">these ethics dreams so for example the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.119" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2">tremulous energies seeking fear and drag</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.859" end="00:40:02.349" style="s2">that Maps really well on to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.060" end="00:40:06.369" style="s2">spiritual or mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.349" end="00:40:08.440" style="s2">experience of awe on the face of mystery</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.369" end="00:40:10.570" style="s2">I say you become the perfect seeker</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.440" end="00:40:14.859" style="s2">you&#39;ll have all this seeking energy but</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.570" end="00:40:18.220" style="s2">you realize there&#39;s there&#39;s it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.859" end="00:40:20.950" style="s2">infinite curiosity in this sense of awe</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.220" end="00:40:23.260" style="s2">and those are the tremulous energies and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.950" end="00:40:26.260" style="s2">you hear a new mystic experience that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.260" end="00:40:29.410" style="s2">there&#39;s always like the trembling in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.260" end="00:40:36.369" style="s2">face of God like there in that same</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.410" end="00:40:40.750" style="s2">direction so again you can work with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.369" end="00:40:46.540" style="s2">same kind of fundamental you know all is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.750" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">in our animal nature in the human push</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.540" end="00:40:57.310" style="s2">to the human form so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">connection that has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.310" end="00:41:05.670" style="s2">like I hate the word unity because it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:08.010" style="s2">sounds it&#39;s conceptually like</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.670" end="00:41:12.250" style="s2">hierarchical but this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.010" end="00:41:14.680" style="s2">experience what South is inter being and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.250" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">you realize that you care for everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.680" end="00:41:19.810" style="s2">but nothing ever is lost and nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:21.609" style="s2">ever gained there&#39;s no panic associated</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.810" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">with this notion of interbeing of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.609" end="00:41:27.010" style="s2">complete participation the interweb of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:30.190" style="s2">everything changes the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.010" end="00:41:34.320" style="s2">care panic it becomes a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.190" end="00:41:34.320" style="s2">experience of that effect stream</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.480" end="00:41:45.600" style="s2">and then in terms of the mastery a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.140" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">stream that play anger and rage I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.600" end="00:41:50.540" style="s2">have a good word for this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:58.520" style="s2">something like wool way the spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.540" end="00:41:58.520" style="s2">alive skillful action its unencumbered</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.870" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">it&#39;s what you get if this stream is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.090" end="00:42:14.780" style="s2">what you discover in the martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:14.780" style="s2">that flow you would say flow could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.270" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">parting Lantana tea spontaneous risk</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.830" end="00:42:28.260" style="s2">yeah spontaneous isn&#39;t it flow is in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:32.760" style="s2">has to do with like a mastery though you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.260" end="00:42:34.920" style="s2">become a sage it&#39;s ageless you know but</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.760" end="00:42:37.800" style="s2">sage without the wisdom it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.920" end="00:42:41.060" style="s2">with you know we&#39;re talking about play</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.800" end="00:42:47.730" style="s2">anger and rage this this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.060" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">can have trickster energy to it I call</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.730" end="00:42:51.300" style="s2">it well where it&#39;s not part it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">perfect but it has all that flavor to it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.300" end="00:42:57.450" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s just it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:58.890" style="s2">excellence in that that affects train it</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.450" end="00:43:09.870" style="s2">comes along with it that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.890" end="00:43:13.800" style="s2">energy signature comes from so this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.870" end="00:43:16.440" style="s2">just as a psycho technology that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.800" end="00:43:19.290" style="s2">work across all levels of all</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.440" end="00:43:22.500" style="s2">individuals you know we&#39;re we&#39;re are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.290" end="00:43:30.930" style="s2">working with where&#39;s the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.500" end="00:43:34.320" style="s2">movement in this direction also to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.930" end="00:43:37.560" style="s2">notice when you you know it also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.320" end="00:43:42.660" style="s2">very similar to the some general notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.560" end="00:43:45.090" style="s2">of Buddha bodies so for example when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.660" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">said earlier if you notice you have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.090" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">certain energy signature you might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:52.890" style="s2">someone more in the mastery stream or</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.890" end="00:44:02.520" style="s2">in the connection stream you tend them</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.760" end="00:44:05.700" style="s2">to become a spiritual adept in that area</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.520" end="00:44:07.830" style="s2">right so you become a healer for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.700" end="00:44:11.430" style="s2">even the connection and you become a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.830" end="00:44:15.750" style="s2">martial artist in the mastery stream or</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.430" end="00:44:17.010" style="s2">you become a mystic in in a more</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.750" end="00:44:21.750" style="s2">conventional sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.010" end="00:44:25.110" style="s2">in the seeking the seeking stream so</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.750" end="00:44:26.970" style="s2">these this shows the continuity all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.110" end="00:44:29.790" style="s2">way from animal nature to Buddha nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.970" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">a seamless continuity it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.790" end="00:44:38.810" style="s2">intervene interpenetrated kind of model</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:42.060" style="s2">where you could then call for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.810" end="00:44:47.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s backed by science reductive</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.060" end="00:44:49.320" style="s2">science and neuroscience and well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.250" end="00:44:52.260" style="s2">a whole nother thing to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.320" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">the play of molecules and how molecules</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:34.980" style="s2">top down as they do those transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.830" end="00:45:41.640" style="s2">types okay I had to get it in there so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.980" end="00:45:49.050" style="s2">we have the basis the path and the goal</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.640" end="00:45:51.600" style="s2">I think it&#39;s easy to see okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.050" end="00:45:53.220" style="s2">I&#39;m describing is my model I teach it in</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.600" end="00:45:56.790" style="s2">my master&#39;s course I teach it for</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.220" end="00:46:00.060" style="s2">coaching it has elements of neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.790" end="00:46:02.760" style="s2">Jack pan SAP and then this woman I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.060" end="00:46:05.070" style="s2">it&#39;s Diane Russell she noticed that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.760" end="00:46:07.259" style="s2">were she was a student of pants caps</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.070" end="00:46:10.259" style="s2">she&#39;s noticed that they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.259" end="00:46:12.599" style="s2">there&#39;s research on whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.259" end="00:46:14.309" style="s2">contractor expanded thing has tested</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.599" end="00:46:17.339" style="s2">with vagal tone which would be really</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.309" end="00:46:21.089" style="s2">cool so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a powerful thing but</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.339" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">now that I&#39;m talking about this matrix</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.089" end="00:46:31.069" style="s2">this is this is my work this is a model</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:33.239" style="s2">I teach okay so in the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.069" end="00:46:35.940" style="s2">community we have these three things the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.239" end="00:46:40.799" style="s2">basis the path and the goal I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.940" end="00:46:44.369" style="s2">intuitive to see which is which so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.799" end="00:46:49.279" style="s2">basis is the connection stream this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.369" end="00:46:49.279" style="s2">the basis of all wisdom and liberation</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.770" end="00:46:57.750" style="s2">path is mastery play the basis is care</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:47:05.600" style="s2">compassion is the word for it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.750" end="00:47:08.910" style="s2">the path is mastery play and the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.600" end="00:47:15.110" style="s2">to stand in the mysteries to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.910" end="00:47:17.940" style="s2">perfect seeker curiosity still hunting</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.110" end="00:47:20.220" style="s2">seeking with it out an object allowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.940" end="00:47:25.580" style="s2">being in the seeking and allowing it all</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.220" end="00:47:25.580" style="s2">to manifest it for you all the display</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.590" end="00:47:39.540" style="s2">so with this with this simple but</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.350" end="00:47:42.630" style="s2">powerful source code right we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.540" end="00:47:49.890" style="s2">source code I think they think it could</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.630" end="00:47:58.770" style="s2">be yeah I think it&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:48:04.140" style="s2">approach I think it there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.770" end="00:48:10.970" style="s2">interesting thing where it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.140" end="00:48:10.970" style="s2">where I find resistance is that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.530" end="00:48:18.570" style="s2">want it to be more complex they feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:19.800" style="s2">like it reduces their human experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.570" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">those are people that too much in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.800" end="00:48:23.580" style="s2">story are too conceptual it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:26.580" style="s2">conceptual enough it&#39;s not complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.580" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">enough it doesn&#39;t have a lot of 12-cell</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.580" end="00:48:33.810" style="s2">out there Sanskrit words you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:35.490" style="s2">there&#39;s all this because many people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.810" end="00:48:37.800" style="s2">are not attracted there&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.490" end="00:48:40.410" style="s2">to shenzhen Jung&#39;s work which about I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.800" end="00:48:44.460" style="s2">think sit-ins and young you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.410" end="00:48:46.290" style="s2">more based on this is this is he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.460" end="00:48:50.070" style="s2">have a lot of effect work he has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.290" end="00:48:52.290" style="s2">more perceptual we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.070" end="00:48:56.940" style="s2">perception later if we continue this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.290" end="00:49:00.500" style="s2">series but the effects are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.940" end="00:49:03.660" style="s2">very complex dynamics are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.500" end="00:49:09.390" style="s2">priming the organism</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.660" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">in sub-threshold ways yeah and then that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.390" end="00:49:15.660" style="s2">can be moved into effective tone then</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">that moves into symbolism or story and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.660" end="00:49:21.890" style="s2">then you get the story builds up energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:21.890" style="s2">and then you talk in your head</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:33.060" style="s2">yeah the AMIA grams and this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.500" end="00:49:35.250" style="s2">know one of the one of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.060" end="00:49:36.690" style="s2">there&#39;s an invitation to play with this</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.250" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">one of the nice fun things about doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.690" end="00:49:39.990" style="s2">source code is that then you can map</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:42.030" style="s2">them on to other things and you find</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.990" end="00:49:47.130" style="s2">distinctions and contractions at a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.030" end="00:49:51.630" style="s2">certain point this this I do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">these are called heuristics in my course</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.630" end="00:49:56.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s a certain type of person</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.150" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">that person who&#39;s got high pattern</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.670" end="00:50:00.780" style="s2">recognition cognition and they try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:03.240" style="s2">map everything onto everything you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.780" end="00:50:05.310" style="s2">the way like when Wilbur came out</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.240" end="00:50:07.980" style="s2">everybody mapped everything on it calls</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.310" end="00:50:12.450" style="s2">it the a qualification or everything you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.980" end="00:50:16.890" style="s2">know so it&#39;s more meant to be very</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.450" end="00:50:18.600" style="s2">useful useful tool in servicing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.890" end="00:50:23.640" style="s2">and being service to yourself and others</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.600" end="00:50:27.780" style="s2">and groups you know constantly try it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.640" end="00:50:30.690" style="s2">a it&#39;s a they&#39;re placeholders for what</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.780" end="00:50:35.160" style="s2">some of you have learned the hard way to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.690" end="00:50:39.390" style="s2">do energetically so instinctively you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.160" end="00:50:41.310" style="s2">have these these ways of making these</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.390" end="00:50:43.080" style="s2">distinctions and discernments but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:45.630" style="s2">really good plate you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.080" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">offered as a placeholder to not only</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.630" end="00:50:53.880" style="s2">support that but to accelerate your</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:56.810" style="s2">expertise or your ability to to work at</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.880" end="00:50:56.810" style="s2">that leverage point</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.400" end="00:51:11.620" style="s2">is there a name for this model yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.350" end="00:51:14.170" style="s2">they do have a name for this model not</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.620" end="00:51:16.020" style="s2">really I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a module in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.170" end="00:51:21.520" style="s2">course that I call the effective</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.020" end="00:51:26.230" style="s2">dimension of self we do aspect we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.520" end="00:51:28.150" style="s2">perception we do spiritual wisdom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.230" end="00:51:30.370" style="s2">so is there a balance point between</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.150" end="00:51:32.440" style="s2">expansion and contraction that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.370" end="00:51:35.580" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s actually a technique</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.440" end="00:51:38.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a valuable technique you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.580" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">experience yourself as holding that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.440" end="00:51:46.060" style="s2">whole range like I&#39;m both fearful and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:52.840" style="s2">still curious at the same time and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.060" end="00:51:54.790" style="s2">you do is you hold open until the body</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.840" end="00:51:57.250" style="s2">resolves that you&#39;ll either be too</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.790" end="00:52:01.150" style="s2">afraid the body made that decision or</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.250" end="00:52:03.790" style="s2">you&#39;ll take the next step so holding</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.150" end="00:52:06.970" style="s2">that balance point if you feel you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.790" end="00:52:09.330" style="s2">right in between you let the body see</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.970" end="00:52:12.790" style="s2">the body because the body is creating</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.330" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">complex dynamics and it&#39;s not one or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.790" end="00:52:17.410" style="s2">other and you can feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:19.450" style="s2">somehow in between so we work with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.410" end="00:52:21.670" style="s2">horses for example and sometimes like</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.450" end="00:52:26.560" style="s2">the stallion get really mad at someone</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.670" end="00:52:30.910" style="s2">and there&#39;s this palpable sense like if</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:34.450" style="s2">one wrong move and you&#39;re and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.910" end="00:52:36.340" style="s2">you can feel you try to release like</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.450" end="00:52:39.100" style="s2">especially horses you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.340" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">more toward angry you&#39;ll start to punch</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.100" end="00:52:44.320" style="s2">up and the horse will say oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:47.380" style="s2">that game that&#39;s a foul so but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.320" end="00:52:50.740" style="s2">want to sink away into nothing and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.380" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">just hold and hold and there are same</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.740" end="00:52:56.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of yin energy it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:59.380" style="s2">true the Mayers will get very narrow Zi</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.380" end="00:53:01.690" style="s2">with women if the women nag them that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.380" end="00:53:04.450" style="s2">says this is stereotypical but the women</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.690" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">nag them they&#39;ll get so they they reach</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.450" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">out and spot them they want to bite them</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">and that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:15.650" style="s2">angry and they want more control and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:17.930" style="s2">there and then it just you just stay</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.650" end="00:53:19.730" style="s2">with that and you wait sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.930" end="00:53:21.890" style="s2">takes 2530 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.730" end="00:53:24.170" style="s2">the horse is holding on body&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.890" end="00:53:27.560" style="s2">on to it too and you can&#39;t find an</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.170" end="00:53:32.330" style="s2">opening you just stay and stay and stay</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.560" end="00:53:34.609" style="s2">until it&#39;s resolved and it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.330" end="00:53:36.560" style="s2">great exercise for this kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.609" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">because you know the horse does not hold</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.560" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">a story so that&#39;s what we say when</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:47.420" style="s2">you&#39;re caught in the limo and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">in-between it&#39;s kind of like being in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.420" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">Bardo state and but but you can count in</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:57.410" style="s2">this case you can count on impermanence</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:54:00.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not can&#39;t stay there forever so</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.410" end="00:54:02.990" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna come and go and take the time</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.410" end="00:54:06.260" style="s2">it takes sometimes what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.990" end="00:54:08.740" style="s2">when we do the coop my course we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.260" end="00:54:12.140" style="s2">people work in pairs and we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.740" end="00:54:15.470" style="s2">it&#39;s described experience situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.140" end="00:54:17.840" style="s2">where you feel most caring like these</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.470" end="00:54:19.750" style="s2">energies as caring energy is pouring out</p>

<p begin="00:54:26.500" end="00:54:31.490" style="s2">what kind of thing makes you contract</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.420" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">what is it that makes you contract and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.490" end="00:54:36.350" style="s2">some people notice that they contract</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:38.600" style="s2">into panic but they might contract into</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.350" end="00:54:40.820" style="s2">anger and you start to see something</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.600" end="00:54:43.880" style="s2">very interesting about this the way this</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.820" end="00:54:45.560" style="s2">thing&#39;s moving around some people go</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.880" end="00:54:49.550" style="s2">from care to anger instead of care to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.560" end="00:54:51.410" style="s2">panic so you can move the contraction</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.550" end="00:54:54.109" style="s2">can move you into a different box I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.410" end="00:54:59.720" style="s2">is this a useful tool but then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.109" end="00:55:02.090" style="s2">notice something about yourself and but</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.720" end="00:55:03.830" style="s2">usually if then you keep working this</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.090" end="00:55:08.330" style="s2">people will notice they went from care</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.830" end="00:55:11.290" style="s2">to panic there they hold a story about</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.330" end="00:55:14.090" style="s2">panic like they&#39;re ashamed of being a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.290" end="00:55:16.700" style="s2">wuss and they&#39;ll go to anger right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.090" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">this usually if you watch and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.700" end="00:55:24.820" style="s2">honest they usually follow a little more</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.820" style="s2">closely that matrix</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.190" end="00:55:43.130" style="s2">yeah so think that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.869" end="00:55:45.460" style="s2">Shawn it&#39;s very close to what Danielle</p>

<p begin="00:57:55.219" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">occurs to me this could be an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.069" end="00:58:02.769" style="s2">useful model to bear in mind in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:05.869" style="s2">moment because if conflict can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.769" end="00:58:07.430" style="s2">engaged in from a place of play and</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.869" end="00:58:08.989" style="s2">curiosity I mean I&#39;ve heard you talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.430" end="00:58:11.209" style="s2">about this I talk about it as friction</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.989" end="00:58:13.239" style="s2">produces forward motion you I think will</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.239" end="00:58:18.650" style="s2">possibility right and and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.829" end="00:58:20.209" style="s2">managing of conflict and I thought this</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.650" end="00:58:21.979" style="s2">strikes me as I mean I&#39;m only just</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.209" end="00:58:23.719" style="s2">thinking about it now it&#39;s new to me but</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.979" end="00:58:29.450" style="s2">it strikes me this to be an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.719" end="00:58:32.539" style="s2">useful and simple map to have in in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.450" end="00:58:34.759" style="s2">kind of domain you know and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.539" end="00:58:36.440" style="s2">in your interlocutor when they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:58:36.440" end="00:58:40.579" style="s2">into anger and and you know the more</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.579" end="00:58:47.650" style="s2">of thing it seems it resolves well not</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.759" end="00:58:58.249" style="s2">resolves but makes a huge step towards</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.650" end="00:59:00.829" style="s2">making that easier yeah when you work</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.249" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">with a model like this as the bones you</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.829" end="00:59:05.209" style="s2">you want it not to contradict any other</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:08.660" style="s2">technique you want to say oh I see that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.209" end="00:59:10.940" style="s2">in conflict resolution I see that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.660" end="00:59:13.670" style="s2">nonviolent communication I see that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.940" end="00:59:19.039" style="s2">this this other something someone else</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.670" end="00:59:24.739" style="s2">is doing and so it&#39;s not an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.039" end="00:59:28.479" style="s2">it should say this can support the make</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.739" end="00:59:33.079" style="s2">the discernment in complex situations so</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.479" end="00:59:34.699" style="s2">when I work with a client I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.079" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">know when I teach I teach this way but</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.699" end="00:59:39.019" style="s2">if you&#39;re working with someone you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:41.869" style="s2">just using this to track your own self</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.019" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">so you&#39;re not getting lost in the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.869" end="00:59:48.380" style="s2">right but your language might be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.510" style="s2">discourse that you&#39;re already situated</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.380" end="00:59:52.490" style="s2">in you know you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.510" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">to use you don&#39;t keep saying god that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.490" end="01:00:00.770" style="s2">care yeah but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:02.630" style="s2">methodology for I mean you can use it</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.770" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">your get it on yourself you like it but</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.630" end="01:00:08.020" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a normal discourse it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:13.400" style="s2">way to help you track and keep on track</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.020" end="01:00:16.070" style="s2">energetically and you know how do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.400" end="01:00:21.230" style="s2">know if something&#39;s contracted well you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.070" end="01:00:23.150" style="s2">know yourself you can feel am i</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.230" end="01:00:25.460" style="s2">contracted or is the other person</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.150" end="01:00:29.780" style="s2">contracted I worked with a client once</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.460" end="01:00:36.410" style="s2">and he said all the boss is so awful you</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.780" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">know he comes in and he yells at all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.410" end="01:00:41.869" style="s2">employees and the employees just take it</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:44.690" style="s2">and he built he creates all this fear in</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.869" end="01:00:48.230" style="s2">his company but the client said it in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.690" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">way I said where&#39;s the sense of fear</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.230" end="01:00:54.500" style="s2">arise and he realized it arose in him</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:57.619" style="s2">like he was working in a company where</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.500" end="01:00:59.150" style="s2">those kinds of kind of like you you</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.619" end="01:01:01.730" style="s2">know whatever all these kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.150" end="01:01:03.380" style="s2">playing very roughhouse play language</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.730" end="01:01:06.369" style="s2">was happening and the contraction was</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.380" end="01:01:12.470" style="s2">happening in him not in the employees</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.369" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">way so you have to be very careful yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.470" end="01:01:17.810" style="s2">so does lust so maybe we need to do the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:27.260" style="s2">next one and lust does let&#39;s move into</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.810" end="01:01:31.960" style="s2">the contracted state yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.260" end="01:01:31.960" style="s2">not a lot of work done on the last one</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.380" end="01:01:37.930" style="s2">we got my imagination going yeah Sean</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.070" end="01:01:46.100" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to relate this to last week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:48.350" style="s2">class I had a sense last week that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.100" end="01:01:50.060" style="s2">feeling that story should kind of be</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.350" end="01:01:53.570" style="s2">thrown away that it was kind of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.060" end="01:01:57.940" style="s2">limiting thing obviously like this week</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.570" end="01:02:00.290" style="s2">it&#39;s more like our stories can modulate</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.940" end="01:02:03.050" style="s2">these feelings from like contracted</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.290" end="01:02:04.260" style="s2">States to healthier states like how</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.050" end="01:02:08.490" style="s2">would you state that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.260" end="01:02:10.350" style="s2">yeah so this is I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.490" end="01:02:13.710" style="s2">in different ways answer questions so</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.350" end="01:02:17.730" style="s2">this is a way to work underneath the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.710" end="01:02:22.140" style="s2">story right so if I have a story you</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.730" end="01:02:27.560" style="s2">know but it&#39;s also where the stories</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.140" end="01:02:31.500" style="s2">arise from and if you look at this model</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.560" end="01:02:33.480" style="s2">you can get expanded like play rough</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.500" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">house playing this map and you could</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.480" end="01:02:40.770" style="s2">have a story that&#39;s kind of generating</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:42.840" style="s2">you just keep more and more and more and</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.770" end="01:02:45.330" style="s2">more place fall because you like Oh play</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.330" end="01:02:51.630" style="s2">find that it become become pathological</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.770" end="01:02:54.119" style="s2">because the energy is being exacerbated</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.630" end="01:02:56.280" style="s2">by the story and you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.119" end="01:02:57.660" style="s2">working toward mastery you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.280" end="01:03:00.270" style="s2">avoiding rage or something the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.660" end="01:03:04.140" style="s2">contraction is important if I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.270" end="01:03:06.420" style="s2">playing and I never find a boundary and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.140" end="01:03:09.030" style="s2">that boundary feels like angry I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.420" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">develop mastery I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.030" end="01:03:17.910" style="s2">distinguish it this is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:20.630" style="s2">trained I know examples but they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.910" end="01:03:23.730" style="s2">is cleaner example so when you train</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.630" end="01:03:26.490" style="s2">like these territorial dogs you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.730" end="01:03:28.980" style="s2">one as a puppy they just they&#39;re bigger</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.490" end="01:03:31.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re very enthusiastic and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.980" end="01:03:34.130" style="s2">they&#39;re very playful and every every</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.560" end="01:03:36.869" style="s2">like fight play fight there and they win</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.130" end="01:03:40.230" style="s2">then you stand you know you have to you</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.869" end="01:03:43.170" style="s2">know you have to show that dog where a</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.230" end="01:03:44.760" style="s2">boundary is because without the boundary</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.170" end="01:03:46.710" style="s2">they just become aggressive dogs they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.760" end="01:03:48.300" style="s2">just kill you know whatever this is fun</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.710" end="01:03:49.800" style="s2">this is fun I killed the rabbit I killed</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.300" end="01:03:52.380" style="s2">this I killed this little Donna killed</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.800" end="01:03:55.010" style="s2">back it&#39;s just it&#39;s just there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.380" end="01:03:58.260" style="s2">boundary a friend of mine actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.010" end="01:04:02.010" style="s2">thinks that the psychopathology and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.260" end="01:04:04.410" style="s2">advanced teachers and gurus is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.010" end="01:04:08.090" style="s2">this that they don&#39;t ever they get</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.410" end="01:04:13.230" style="s2">beyond the boundary they get beyond</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.090" end="01:04:15.109" style="s2">having another human being to surf</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.230" end="01:04:17.460" style="s2">boundaries so it does it no longer</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.109" end="01:04:22.380" style="s2">creates mastery</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.460" end="01:04:24.119" style="s2">it creates a kind of pathology so it can</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.380" end="01:04:29.880" style="s2">look like narcissism or someone&#39;s out of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.119" end="01:04:35.010" style="s2">control so Jamie will called that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.880" end="01:04:38.190" style="s2">Luciferian yeah yeah even God couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.010" end="01:04:40.619" style="s2">destroy Lucifer right there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.190" end="01:04:44.609" style="s2">why God needed Lucifer bah-bah-bah okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.619" end="01:04:47.640" style="s2">so the story can also be to a positive</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.609" end="01:04:49.500" style="s2">you know story to not just like oh you</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.640" end="01:04:52.530" style="s2">know control a story that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.500" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">contracted the question is can I live</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.530" end="01:04:59.040" style="s2">with a body whose rhythms are adequate</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:05:01.830" style="s2">to the reality there I am in and not</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.040" end="01:05:03.930" style="s2">impute stories on them not have them</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.830" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">follow tracks of stories that are either</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.930" end="01:05:12.330" style="s2">said or happier you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:15.349" style="s2">so now stories can be helpful in little</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.330" end="01:05:15.349" style="s2">amounts you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.529" end="01:05:29.079" style="s2">people we really don&#39;t understand this</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.689" end="01:05:32.519" style="s2">these little playgrounds aren&#39;t but we</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.079" end="01:05:37.299" style="s2">really don&#39;t understand how much we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.519" end="01:05:39.789" style="s2">storied people so for example there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.299" end="01:05:44.499" style="s2">this notion of ellipses in moviemaking</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.789" end="01:05:47.169" style="s2">does anybody know that and ellipses is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.499" end="01:05:50.469" style="s2">like you&#39;ll be watching a sitcom and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.169" end="01:05:53.049" style="s2">two women will be like oh I&#39;m so nervous</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.469" end="01:05:55.569" style="s2">I&#39;m going out on this date tonight in</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.049" end="01:05:58.390" style="s2">Bonn you have a conversation and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.569" end="01:06:01.689" style="s2">then the next you know two seconds later</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.390" end="01:06:03.549" style="s2">you see you&#39;re on the couch again and</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.689" end="01:06:08.489" style="s2">one&#39;s got like an ice bag on her head</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.549" end="01:06:12.069" style="s2">and you fill in the hole the whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.489" end="01:06:15.789" style="s2">central story is this day and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.069" end="01:06:18.579" style="s2">in the TV it&#39;s not in the sitcom you</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.789" end="01:06:20.949" style="s2">fill it in yourself right and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.579" end="01:06:23.169" style="s2">what happens to us all the time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.949" end="01:06:25.419" style="s2">very little going on there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.169" end="01:06:32.369" style="s2">perceptual information going on in many</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.419" end="01:06:36.279" style="s2">cases and you just like yeah you just</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.369" end="01:06:39.549" style="s2">you just put all this stuff on and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.279" end="01:06:41.559" style="s2">when you live in this story you up</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.549" end="01:06:44.139" style="s2">your aspect system and you can literally</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.559" end="01:06:47.319" style="s2">cannot see reality and when you can see</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.139" end="01:06:53.429" style="s2">reality it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.319" end="01:06:53.429" style="s2">and you miss all that all the time</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.429" end="01:07:01.389" style="s2">so someone interestly asked about</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.409" end="01:07:03.219" style="s2">Christopher Alexander where did that</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.389" end="01:07:05.799" style="s2">come from because I was gonna start</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.219" end="01:07:08.859" style="s2">today by reading a passage from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.799" end="01:07:10.749" style="s2">timeless way of building so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.859" end="01:07:15.969" style="s2">kind of like who asked the Christopher</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.749" end="01:07:18.969" style="s2">my exams a question yeah so why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.969" end="01:07:22.139" style="s2">just end with the thing that I was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.969" end="01:07:26.380" style="s2">begin with I don&#39;t know what this this</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.139" end="01:07:30.359" style="s2">happened but there&#39;s some magic in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.380" end="01:07:30.359" style="s2">space okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.410" end="01:07:45.770" style="s2">so this isn&#39;t a chapter called being</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.530" end="01:07:49.970" style="s2">alive and the title of this little</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.770" end="01:07:53.210" style="s2">section is this wild freedom this</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.970" end="01:07:59.660" style="s2">passion comes into our lives in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.210" end="01:08:02.060" style="s2">instance we let go it was it is when all</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.660" end="01:08:05.930" style="s2">our forces can move freely</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.060" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">in us in nature this quality is almost</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.930" end="01:08:11.600" style="s2">automatic because there are no images to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:16.820" style="s2">interfere with natural processes of</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.600" end="01:08:19.250" style="s2">making things but in all our creations</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.820" end="01:08:21.470" style="s2">the possibility occurs that images can</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.250" end="01:08:25.730" style="s2">interfere with the natural necessary</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.470" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">orders of things and most of all this</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.730" end="01:08:31.790" style="s2">way that images distort the things we</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:35.150" style="s2">make is familiar in ourselves for we</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.790" end="01:08:39.230" style="s2">ourselves are like our words the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.150" end="01:08:41.900" style="s2">products of our own creation and we are</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.230" end="01:08:45.890" style="s2">only free and have that quality without</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.900" end="01:08:52.910" style="s2">a name when we give up the images which</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.890" end="01:08:54.830" style="s2">guide our lives yet each of us faces the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.910" end="01:08:59.540" style="s2">fear of letting go the fear of being</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.830" end="01:09:02.840" style="s2">just exactly what one is of letting the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.540" end="01:09:06.460" style="s2">forces flow freely of letting the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.840" end="01:09:12.560" style="s2">configuration of one&#39;s person adjust</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.460" end="01:09:14.750" style="s2">truly to these forces our letting go is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:17.330" style="s2">stifled all the time so long as we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.750" end="01:09:19.940" style="s2">ideas and opinions about ourselves which</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.330" end="01:09:22.730" style="s2">make us hug too tightly to our images of</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.940" end="01:09:26.120" style="s2">how we live and follow up these forces</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.730" end="01:09:31.870" style="s2">and yet until one does let go it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.120" end="01:09:31.870" style="s2">impossible it is impossible to be alive</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.680" end="01:10:05.670" style="s2">in this case the forces are these effect</p>
