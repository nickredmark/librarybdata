<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:37.169" style="s2">yeah yeah because we said a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.580" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">they said a lot of stuff I&#39;m sure there</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.169" end="00:05:41.880" style="s2">were minor minor things as always when</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:44.849" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a developing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.880" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">situation with new news that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.849" end="00:05:48.419" style="s2">daily there are things that we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:50.849" style="s2">believe to be true that turned out not</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.419" end="00:05:52.410" style="s2">to be true but I don&#39;t think that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.849" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">were things that we said that are an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.410" end="00:05:56.669" style="s2">absolute need of correction right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">yeah and usually we get really good</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.669" end="00:06:02.640" style="s2">feedback where people point us to things</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">and I must say one of the delightful</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.640" end="00:06:07.469" style="s2">parts of this horrifying situation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">that you and I have gotten to interact</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.469" end="00:06:12.570" style="s2">with our audience a bit the way we did</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:14.969" style="s2">with the classes when we taught at</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.570" end="00:06:17.130" style="s2">Evergreen and the interaction is great</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.969" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">as with Evergreen we are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.130" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">learning things that we didn&#39;t know by</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.810" end="00:06:23.760" style="s2">virtue of the fact of a very engaged</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">audience who is fanning out across all</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.760" end="00:06:27.659" style="s2">of the things one could be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:29.639" style="s2">and they bring us useful information all</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.659" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">the time so in fact comments coming in</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.639" end="00:06:33.479" style="s2">fact I got a text from a former student</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:36.449" style="s2">yesterday the day before I think I read</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.479" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">it to you saying that it reminded him of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.449" end="00:06:40.440" style="s2">his time with us both in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.370" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">and in the field so that was nice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.440" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s good it&#39;s nice to to have that back</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:48.210" style="s2">in our lives all right so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">should probably start by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.210" end="00:06:55.289" style="s2">the situation in Guayaquil Ecuador now</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:58.340" style="s2">for those of you who don&#39;t know why kill</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.289" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">Ecuador is Ecuador&#39;s most populous city</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:07:04.129" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the capital the capital is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:07.080" style="s2">Quito and Quito is high in the Andes</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.129" end="00:07:09.569" style="s2">Guayaquil is on the coast on the west</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.080" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">coast of South America close to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.569" end="00:07:15.419" style="s2">coast it&#39;s it&#39;s on yeah it&#39;s on the gwil</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:16.979" style="s2">River I guess I don&#39;t remember but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.419" end="00:07:19.650" style="s2">not it&#39;s not exactly on the coast but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.979" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">sits in the humid lowlands humid</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.650" end="00:07:24.419" style="s2">lowlands and it is a major port city so</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:26.219" style="s2">somehow maybe a bit like Portland things</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.419" end="00:07:28.409" style="s2">are coming up the river and docking in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.219" end="00:07:32.849" style="s2">Guayaquil but in any case Guayaquil</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.409" end="00:07:36.270" style="s2">broke into the news late this week as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.849" end="00:07:39.990" style="s2">absolutely horrifying situation began to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.270" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">emerge with respect to the fragile</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.990" end="00:07:45.870" style="s2">health care system in Guayaquil and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">system that deals with the dead became</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.870" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">overwhelmed and bodies are now lying in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:54.750" style="s2">the street some families have ended up</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">living with their own dead many of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:07:59.940" style="s2">have died of kovat 19 but irrespective</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.419" end="00:08:02.430" style="s2">of what people died from there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.940" end="00:08:04.710" style="s2">mechanism for dealing with the number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.430" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">bodies that are emerging and so people</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.710" end="00:08:09.210" style="s2">are keeping them inside as long as they</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:11.550" style="s2">can often these families are living</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.210" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">without air-conditioning and then at</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.550" end="00:08:16.740" style="s2">some point the smell of the decaying</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:19.469" style="s2">relative has forced people to drag these</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.740" end="00:08:23.400" style="s2">bodies of people they loved outside and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.469" end="00:08:26.819" style="s2">so there are many many instances of by</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:29.370" style="s2">bodies just simply lying in public many</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.819" end="00:08:33.269" style="s2">of them not in a casket just simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.370" end="00:08:35.810" style="s2">lying in the open and it&#39;s a tragic and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.269" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">certainly psychologically devastating</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">situation for the citizens of Guayaquil</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:44.790" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:46.769" style="s2">I we have spent a lot of time in Ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.790" end="00:08:49.529" style="s2">I have not been to Guayaquil you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.769" end="00:08:52.230" style="s2">been there I was I went through there in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.529" end="00:08:55.019" style="s2">2014 with my study abroad class my first</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.230" end="00:08:57.420" style="s2">study abroad in Ecuador just just went</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.019" end="00:08:59.910" style="s2">through I had to stop to get our bus</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.420" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">cleaned out and you know I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.910" end="00:09:03.089" style="s2">impressed with it as a city it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:04.259" style="s2">some place that I wanted to live whereas</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.089" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">there are a lot of places in Ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.259" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">that I do feel like I would I would love</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:12.120" style="s2">to to spend a lot of time there but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:17.910" style="s2">was as every place that I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.120" end="00:09:22.529" style="s2">Ecuador a bustling vibrant culturally</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.910" end="00:09:28.139" style="s2">deep rich and historic place and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.529" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">these images you know we all we all will</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.139" end="00:09:33.569" style="s2">relate most to those places that we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:35.850" style="s2">a personal relationship with and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.569" end="00:09:37.769" style="s2">while yes I&#39;ve been to Guayaquil it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.850" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">more that this was happening this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.769" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">happening in Ecuador where we have both</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">spent considerable time it&#39;s a country</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:49.649" style="s2">that we love and seeing seeing these</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:53.190" style="s2">signs of utter horror in Ecuador brought</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.649" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">home what might start to be happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.190" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">throughout Latin America throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:10:01.019" style="s2">rest of the developing world in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:02.699" style="s2">that probably will not manifest in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.019" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">in the weird countries and developed</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.699" end="00:10:08.670" style="s2">countries only because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">slightly thicker margin we aren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.670" end="00:10:14.069" style="s2">on such a razor-thin margin with regard</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:18.540" style="s2">to our healthcare well I actually this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.069" end="00:10:20.970" style="s2">is all making me wonder a bit so when</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.540" end="00:10:23.339" style="s2">you first ran across a tweet from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.970" end="00:10:25.769" style="s2">friend of ours on Twitter mentioning the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.339" end="00:10:28.709" style="s2">situation in Guayaquil the images were</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.769" end="00:10:31.319" style="s2">almost beyond belief such that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.709" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">both felt very nervous about saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.319" end="00:10:36.510" style="s2">anything because what if somehow anyway</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:37.860" style="s2">we were both quite concerned that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.510" end="00:10:39.149" style="s2">there was something about the story that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.860" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be right and then it turned out</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.149" end="00:10:43.769" style="s2">an hour or two before the LA Times had</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">published a story that reflected the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.769" end="00:10:50.310" style="s2">very same pattern so we knew that it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:53.779" style="s2">it was real but in understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.310" end="00:10:55.900" style="s2">story it a couple things emerged one</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.779" end="00:10:57.790" style="s2">some of you will remember that in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.900" end="00:11:00.220" style="s2">last livestream I mentioned a particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.790" end="00:11:01.930" style="s2">concern about the role that homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.220" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2">is going to play and we in the United</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.930" end="00:11:05.830" style="s2">States if you&#39;re not an American maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t know but we in the United</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.830" end="00:11:11.530" style="s2">States have a an absolutely terrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">problem with homelessness in every urban</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.530" end="00:11:17.740" style="s2">center I can think of and it&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">part of the landscape it was always</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.740" end="00:11:22.510" style="s2">there to some extent but the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.740" end="00:11:26.080" style="s2">which there are homeless encampments all</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.510" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">around Portland LA every especially on</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.080" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">the west coast which don&#39;t have such</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:31.960" style="s2">harsh winters right so they&#39;ll survive</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.580" end="00:11:35.230" style="s2">people who are homeless can survive for</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.960" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">quite some time but I raise the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.230" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">in the last live stream about what</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:42.100" style="s2">happens you know I don&#39;t think we think</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">very much about how it is that homeless</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.100" end="00:11:47.530" style="s2">people function in their daily lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2">mostly the you know if you become</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.530" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">preoccupied with how the homeless are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:54.550" style="s2">living it takes over your mind and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:56.380" style="s2">anyway we all become more practiced and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.550" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">we should and ignoring the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.380" end="00:12:01.000" style="s2">what it means is that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:05.230" style="s2">have a deep understanding of for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.000" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">how it is that these people eat right</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">what is it that they are eating and as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:11.590" style="s2">thought about that question more and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">more I realized that probably the places</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.590" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">that they are are largely chosen because</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:19.450" style="s2">they have proximity to places where</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:22.570" style="s2">people throw away lots of food like near</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.450" end="00:12:24.540" style="s2">you know food courts and fast food</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.570" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">restaurants and things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.540" end="00:12:30.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve been watching those places shut</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.880" end="00:12:33.790" style="s2">down and wondering if there is not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.340" end="00:12:35.620" style="s2">brewing crisis you know amongst homeless</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.790" end="00:12:37.900" style="s2">people of starvation and if it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.620" end="00:12:40.390" style="s2">been you know going for a couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:42.730" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.390" end="00:12:48.250" style="s2">certainly it could it could be true and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.730" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">my question really is the the situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.250" end="00:12:52.180" style="s2">in Guayaquil reveals a pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen with respect to other things</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.180" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">non-human things which is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:13:02.140" style="s2">many things which can fluctuate in their</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:03.700" style="s2">availability or their commonality up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.140" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">some point at which they cross a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.700" end="00:13:07.780" style="s2">threshold at which point you noticed if</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:09.459" style="s2">something has happened so for example I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.780" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">don&#39;t remember in</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.459" end="00:13:16.420" style="s2">my lifetime when toilet paper or beans</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:18.369" style="s2">or rice or any of the things that people</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.420" end="00:13:24.129" style="s2">have been hoarding have been unavailable</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.369" end="00:13:25.990" style="s2">in a store and in the US we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.129" end="00:13:29.079" style="s2">traveled places we&#39;ve and we&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.990" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">classes where these basics were not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.079" end="00:13:34.209" style="s2">available sometimes ever and some but</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:35.470" style="s2">but in the u.s. or in in Europe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.209" end="00:13:39.100" style="s2">never seen this before</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.470" end="00:13:40.779" style="s2">and likewise I&#39;m a huge fan of isopropyl</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.100" end="00:13:42.459" style="s2">alcohol I usually have a lot of it on</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.779" end="00:13:44.139" style="s2">hand to clean with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.459" end="00:13:46.389" style="s2">non-toxic we have an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.139" end="00:13:49.509" style="s2">history with the molecules in question</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.389" end="00:13:51.129" style="s2">and so it&#39;s I consider it a very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.509" end="00:13:52.869" style="s2">cleaning product but we didn&#39;t have very</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.129" end="00:13:55.149" style="s2">much when this started and suddenly it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.869" end="00:13:56.230" style="s2">was unavailable everywhere so you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.149" end="00:13:57.100" style="s2">to say something about what you bought</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:03.929" style="s2">in its dead</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.100" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">well I&#39;ve branched out I&#39;ve gotten some</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.929" end="00:14:09.910" style="s2">Everclear is very high proof grain</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:13.480" style="s2">alcohol 190-proof reminiscent of bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.910" end="00:14:16.209" style="s2">college days yeah so anyway that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.480" end="00:14:17.319" style="s2">available relatively inexpensively and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.209" end="00:14:22.869" style="s2">you know would function as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.319" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">disinfectant if if it needed to be I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.869" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">also gotten OxiClean which turns into</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:31.449" style="s2">hydrogen peroxide when I said it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.069" style="s2">water we bought some hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.449" end="00:14:35.649" style="s2">but anyway they&#39;re you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.069" end="00:14:37.749" style="s2">forced to branch out because a seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.649" end="00:14:39.490" style="s2">indefinitely large supply of isopropyl</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.749" end="00:14:42.670" style="s2">alcohol dwindled all of a sudden as</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.490" end="00:14:45.160" style="s2">kovat 19 emerged anyway my point would</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.670" end="00:14:48.009" style="s2">be the fluctuations in the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.160" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">have to be a constant fact but if your</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.009" end="00:14:51.549" style="s2">interface with that supply chain is at</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:53.379" style="s2">the store you don&#39;t notice that anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.549" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">at all has happened even if the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.379" end="00:14:57.100" style="s2">use tripled of one of these things you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:15:00.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know because the store shelf is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.100" end="00:15:01.959" style="s2">full at the point that you reach a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.220" end="00:15:04.499" style="s2">threshold that the supply chain cannot</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.959" end="00:15:06.850" style="s2">keep up suddenly the shelf is empty</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.499" end="00:15:08.589" style="s2">suddenly people understand the value of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.850" end="00:15:10.360" style="s2">the thing and then it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.589" end="00:15:13.079" style="s2">emptiness spreads across the city as</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:15.819" style="s2">people hoard what little bit remains and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.079" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a long-winded explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.819" end="00:15:21.129" style="s2">saying the same thing is true for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:23.230" style="s2">capacity to deal with the dead right</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.129" end="00:15:25.540" style="s2">people die at different rates</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.230" end="00:15:27.880" style="s2">and the number of bodies produced in any</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.540" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">given month may vary quite a bit but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.880" end="00:15:31.840" style="s2">don&#39;t notice that there is a maximum</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:34.690" style="s2">capacity at which a city can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.840" end="00:15:36.370" style="s2">the dead until we exceed that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.690" end="00:15:39.370" style="s2">and then we exceed the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">morgues with refrigerators and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.370" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">bodies are lying in the street and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">anyway Guayaquil has revealed that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:49.270" style="s2">is a threshold yeah and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">healthcare it&#39;s death care right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.270" end="00:15:53.980" style="s2">its body care it&#39;s it&#39;s the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:56.680" style="s2">morgues and ability to transport bodies</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:15:57.760" style="s2">that is why we can see what we can know</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.680" end="00:16:01.630" style="s2">presumably what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.760" end="00:16:03.670" style="s2">hospitals there is awful as well and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.630" end="00:16:06.280" style="s2">in the US are hearing about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.670" end="00:16:08.740" style="s2">on in our hospitals but we so far did</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.280" end="00:16:11.790" style="s2">not have any scenes of horror from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.740" end="00:16:14.470" style="s2">streets of dead bodies in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.790" end="00:16:17.110" style="s2">that just that proved to be a particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.470" end="00:16:19.270" style="s2">kind of visceral visual that I at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.110" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t hadn&#39;t prepared for I didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.270" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">it coming I think there&#39;s another factor</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:29.110" style="s2">playing in here which is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:33.130" style="s2">largely Catholic country and Ecuador is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.110" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">Ecuador and the prohibition against</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.130" end="00:16:37.780" style="s2">cremation amongst Catholics in other</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:39.910" style="s2">words the Christian need for the body to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.780" end="00:16:44.050" style="s2">remain intact at burial for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.910" end="00:16:47.380" style="s2">of later resurrection that is getting in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.050" end="00:16:50.140" style="s2">the way I presume of a rational program</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.380" end="00:16:51.640" style="s2">of stepping up cremations that might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.140" end="00:16:53.320" style="s2">dealing with this that&#39;s conjecture on</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.640" end="00:16:55.060" style="s2">my part but all of the pieces seem to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.320" end="00:16:57.540" style="s2">fit well there also I mean there may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.060" end="00:16:59.800" style="s2">a supply problem in terms of crematoria</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.540" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">precisely because there has been so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.800" end="00:17:05.920" style="s2">little demand in the past that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:09.400" style="s2">although I know that the the local</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.920" end="00:17:14.710" style="s2">government has announced glass products</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.400" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">yes has announced that it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.710" end="00:17:17.680" style="s2">find a solution to the burial problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:19.870" style="s2">that it is going to bury people</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.680" end="00:17:22.660" style="s2">individually and I must say on the one</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.870" end="00:17:25.240" style="s2">hand that strikes me as good news that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.660" end="00:17:28.360" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about solution making on</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.240" end="00:17:31.000" style="s2">the other hand this might not be the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.360" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">time to adhere to the these traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.000" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">at this level and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:39.850" style="s2">you know there are two solutions really</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">one people could move to cremation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">the the country could you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">too hard to put together a crematorium</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:54.399" style="s2">that could accommodate these bodies or</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:56.470" style="s2">the bodies could be buried together and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.399" end="00:18:00.419" style="s2">it strikes me that this comes down to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.470" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">question of you know maybe in light of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.419" end="00:18:08.500" style="s2">the situation the Pope might step in and</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.419" end="00:18:33.129" style="s2">to bend these traditions for these</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.450" end="00:18:55.419" style="s2">measures sometimes right so in this case</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.419" end="00:19:00.429" style="s2">you&#39;re not arguing were neither of us is</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.970" end="00:19:11.019" style="s2">that you can go such that you know for</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.009" end="00:19:13.149" style="s2">sure that the person that you love has</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.019" end="00:19:15.789" style="s2">died and that you have a way of visiting</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.149" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">them and informing them in the future of</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">right and you know not all cultures do</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.419" end="00:19:24.850" style="s2">this but many many cultures every every</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:27.340" style="s2">culture I believe has some kind of death</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.850" end="00:19:30.149" style="s2">ritual and a vast majority of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.340" end="00:19:34.389" style="s2">that are known in on this planet have</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.149" end="00:19:36.340" style="s2">some kind of way of interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.389" end="00:19:40.360" style="s2">effectively the spirit of the body</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.340" end="00:19:42.789" style="s2">afterwards so in this case this is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.360" end="00:19:45.550" style="s2">to say what the hell why are they so</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.789" end="00:19:47.590" style="s2">focused on wanting to bury their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.550" end="00:19:49.420" style="s2">of their loved ones individually we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.590" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">understand why that is useful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.420" end="00:19:55.330" style="s2">helpful and and has been adaptive but in</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:19:57.400" style="s2">this case it may actually cause more</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.330" end="00:19:59.650" style="s2">kinks in the system and may cause more</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.650" end="00:20:04.270" style="s2">no opportunity to get out of there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.810" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">opportunity and the situation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.270" end="00:20:10.420" style="s2">facing a global pandemic spreading at</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:13.270" style="s2">this rate this is novel so whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.420" end="00:20:15.850" style="s2">can say the traditions that stretch back</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.270" end="00:20:20.260" style="s2">thousands of years are not equipped for</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.850" end="00:20:21.970" style="s2">the modern world and it&#39;s time to begin</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.260" end="00:20:24.370" style="s2">to alter the rules so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.970" end="00:20:27.310" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna traumatize people to an</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.370" end="00:20:29.730" style="s2">extreme extent the you know bodies in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.310" end="00:20:33.250" style="s2">the street is a that&#39;s a very dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.730" end="00:20:36.100" style="s2">thing to have children encountering for</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.250" end="00:20:39.400" style="s2">example I saw one film of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.100" end="00:20:41.610" style="s2">body that had been there six days and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.400" end="00:20:44.350" style="s2">line to get in the pharmacy that went</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.610" end="00:20:48.310" style="s2">effectively right by it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.350" end="00:20:50.170" style="s2">this is just so devastating but one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.310" end="00:20:52.300" style="s2">the other things I saw in many of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.170" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">videos is that people in Guayaquil are</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.300" end="00:20:56.820" style="s2">wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:21:00.190" style="s2">that you and I can&#39;t buy at any price</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.820" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">now that tells you this this also raises</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.190" end="00:21:08.830" style="s2">questions about why is it that in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:10.840" style="s2">country masks were not stored in great</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.830" end="00:21:12.970" style="s2">numbers for this contingency they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.840" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">obviously very inexpensive relative to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.970" end="00:21:18.370" style="s2">the cost of not having them and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.210" end="00:21:20.530" style="s2">thing I really am having a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.370" end="00:21:23.260" style="s2">wrapping my mind around is that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.530" end="00:21:26.410" style="s2">cannot bootstrap a mechanism to produce</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.260" end="00:21:27.910" style="s2">them rapidly we should be able should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.410" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">able to produce those things on a dime</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.910" end="00:21:33.910" style="s2">and frankly the country that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">grew up in could have our country has</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.910" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">now you know become so heavily based</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:42.070" style="s2">around a service economy in which all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:44.950" style="s2">the products are manufactured elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.070" end="00:21:50.890" style="s2">that we have made ourselves extremely</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.950" end="00:21:53.290" style="s2">vulnerable and anyway we when we get out</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.890" end="00:21:54.580" style="s2">of this whatever that looks like one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.290" end="00:21:58.840" style="s2">the things that we should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.580" end="00:22:00.280" style="s2">about is how this could have been worse</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.840" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">what we could have done that would have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.280" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">made it vastly better and not having</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:08.950" style="s2">everything driven by a concern with</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">economic efficiency to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.950" end="00:22:16.540" style="s2">every supply chain is you know is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.340" style="s2">coefficient away from breakdown such</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.540" end="00:22:22.030" style="s2">that it can all happen simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.340" end="00:22:23.920" style="s2">yeah with a read of masks anecdotally I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.030" end="00:22:26.260" style="s2">will say I was just at the grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.920" end="00:22:29.350" style="s2">shopping for our younger son&#39;s birthday</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.260" end="00:22:30.610" style="s2">tomorrow and for the first time it had</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.350" end="00:22:31.090" style="s2">been about a week since I&#39;d been at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.610" end="00:22:34.600" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.090" end="00:22:37.060" style="s2">and still not a majority of people in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.600" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">masks but a significant fraction a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.060" end="00:22:41.980" style="s2">significant minority whereas in the past</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:43.390" style="s2">three or four weeks I&#39;ve been the only</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.980" end="00:22:45.850" style="s2">or maybe one of two people in the entire</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.390" end="00:22:49.450" style="s2">store and now there are about half of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.850" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">the employees and a significant minority</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.450" end="00:22:55.420" style="s2">of the other patrons they were masked of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:57.070" style="s2">some and in some way so that that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.420" end="00:22:59.830" style="s2">interesting that that is finally</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.070" end="00:23:01.870" style="s2">spreading I agree in fact I was at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.830" end="00:23:06.100" style="s2">hardware store yesterday sourcing a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.870" end="00:23:09.460" style="s2">necessary plumbing part and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.100" end="00:23:11.140" style="s2">employees recognized me because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.460" end="00:23:14.680" style="s2">apparently I had become you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.140" end="00:23:16.810" style="s2">Bandit who haunted the hardware store as</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.680" end="00:23:18.850" style="s2">a result of the bandana and he some</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.810" end="00:23:21.190" style="s2">coming in my bandana and he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.850" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">you&#39;re back um so anyway yes I am now</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.190" end="00:23:25.780" style="s2">seeing people wearing masks I saw</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:27.130" style="s2">somebody wearing a full-face one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.780" end="00:23:29.680" style="s2">these masks like welders</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.130" end="00:23:30.910" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t dark but it you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.680" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">one of these things that covers the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.910" end="00:23:35.710" style="s2">whole face so anyway people are now</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:37.000" style="s2">beginning to innovate which is good but</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.710" end="00:23:38.890" style="s2">nonetheless the fact that we have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.000" end="00:23:43.630" style="s2">capacity to manufacture these things on</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.890" end="00:23:44.620" style="s2">a dime is amazing yeah you have more</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.630" end="00:23:48.490" style="s2">that you want to say about guajillo</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.620" end="00:23:50.110" style="s2">should we move into this question of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.490" end="00:23:52.630" style="s2">we how we assess the information we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:54.520" style="s2">getting which is which is related which</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.630" end="00:23:56.860" style="s2">is related well why don&#39;t we go there</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.520" end="00:23:58.540" style="s2">yeah suck I don&#39;t we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.860" end="00:24:00.550" style="s2">screen visible you want it can you show</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.540" end="00:24:03.310" style="s2">that tweet that we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.550" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">from the sky yeah yo it says that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.310" end="00:24:07.170" style="s2">the link that says yo yo posted the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:07.170" style="s2">first video</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">okay so we do not have the screen</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.590" end="00:24:18.140" style="s2">visible I&#39;m gonna trust that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:20.570" style="s2">gonna get it done Thank You kiddo so</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.140" end="00:24:23.990" style="s2">really one of one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.570" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">this this pandemic and societal response</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.990" end="00:24:37.450" style="s2">to it has revealed is how and not just</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:37.450" style="s2">how poor it is you want to keep it up</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.750" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.300" end="00:24:45.380" style="s2">not just how poor information is but how</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:47.000" style="s2">unprepared</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.380" end="00:24:48.890" style="s2">most people are including the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.000" end="00:24:50.510" style="s2">are delivering us the information to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.890" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">assess the quality of information so</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.510" end="00:24:56.300" style="s2">almost no one seems to be sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">real-time thinking huh well let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.300" end="00:25:00.890" style="s2">it&#39;s health workers for whom these masks</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:03.380" style="s2">are generally made but we&#39;re being told</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.890" end="00:25:05.210" style="s2">that they have no efficacy how could</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.380" end="00:25:08.090" style="s2">that possibly be true right like this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.210" end="00:25:11.420" style="s2">the obvious one right when you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.090" end="00:25:12.740" style="s2">WHO and the World Health Organization</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.340" end="00:27:55.650" style="s2">through a couple of other pieces of</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.650" end="00:27:59.820" style="s2">last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:01.260" style="s2">just as the schools were closing down</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.820" end="00:28:02.820" style="s2">here in Portland we&#39;d already been</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.260" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">quarantine and you know close to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.820" end="00:28:09.720" style="s2">quarantine for a bit I read an account</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:11.220" style="s2">of a hospital in Seattle that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.720" end="00:28:14.580" style="s2">already under such duress</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.220" end="00:28:16.520" style="s2">they were so slammed that they weren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.350" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">that&#39;s shocking and it&#39;s totally untrue</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.660" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">as it turns out it&#39;s completely not true</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:32.429" style="s2">but at the point I saw this I had no way</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:33.550" style="s2">to verify it there was there was just as</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.429" end="00:28:36.910" style="s2">one claim</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.550" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">and I probably stupidly mentioned it at</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.910" end="00:28:40.390" style="s2">the dinner table and we talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:43.330" style="s2">with with our kids with our you know 13</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.390" end="00:28:46.120" style="s2">or 15 year old boys and I&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.330" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t help the the level of fear and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.120" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">concern that you know we were all</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.740" end="00:28:54.550" style="s2">experiencing why did anyone spread that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:56.200" style="s2">why why is someone fear-mongering right</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.550" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">now there&#39;s plenty of legitimate fear to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.200" end="00:29:00.190" style="s2">go around it&#39;s a it&#39;s a totally awful</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:02.110" style="s2">thing to be doing it&#39;s you know at least</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.770" end="00:29:12.040" style="s2">there is can you put up the letter from</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.410" end="00:29:14.560" style="s2">f scott Fitzgerald Zach compare this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.040" end="00:29:17.050" style="s2">the equally false letter from F scott</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.540" end="00:29:30.280" style="s2">was written by someone a couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.100" end="00:29:34.420" style="s2">ago but it&#39;s charming and it has this</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.070" end="00:29:57.970" style="s2">and you know there was no ill intent and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:59.170" style="s2">in fact I think it&#39;s other than people</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.970" end="00:30:02.140" style="s2">being a little embarrassed if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.170" end="00:30:04.270" style="s2">shared it thinking it was true I think</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.650" end="00:30:17.890" style="s2">just one more example that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">mention and here zach is this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.890" end="00:30:21.670" style="s2">screenshot it at the top of the second</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.500" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">this this again was a tweet that I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.380" end="00:30:32.680" style="s2">not have seen but for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:33.820" style="s2">someone in respond replying to it tagged</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.680" end="00:30:39.790" style="s2">me and said what do you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.820" end="00:30:41.620" style="s2">think of this and it argues it&#39;s yes so</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.790" end="00:30:44.500" style="s2">if you can go into the screenshots</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.620" end="00:30:46.700" style="s2">themselves let&#39;s so this is presumably</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.500" end="00:30:49.159" style="s2">and just hold off for a second sacked</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.700" end="00:30:50.739" style="s2">this is the first page of the preprint</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.159" end="00:30:52.789" style="s2">that was supposedly up on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.739" end="00:30:58.249" style="s2">scientific site until was taken down</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.789" end="00:31:02.029" style="s2">next page this is the first full page of</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.029" end="00:31:08.299" style="s2">short article but it&#39;s got a whole list</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.799" end="00:31:09.769" style="s2">of references and it argues for</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.299" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">something we were talking about our last</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.769" end="00:31:16.340" style="s2">livestream which is this sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">know it&#39;s not incidental that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.340" end="00:31:19.909" style="s2">happened in Wuhan but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.619" style="s2">that it was an intentional bioweapon it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.909" end="00:31:24.379" style="s2">could have escaped from a lab that was</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.009" end="00:31:32.299" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about this paper</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.940" end="00:31:33.739" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t ring true to me and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.299" end="00:31:36.679" style="s2">know the idea that it went up and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.739" end="00:31:38.840" style="s2">it was pulled why was it full I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.679" end="00:31:43.429" style="s2">know the formatting is really</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.840" end="00:31:47.149" style="s2">unstandardized people and weird it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.429" end="00:31:49.580" style="s2">like it&#39;s it reads like what a native</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.149" end="00:31:51.799" style="s2">English speaker would imagine a native</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:53.749" style="s2">Chinese speaker would sound like as they</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.359" end="00:32:05.269" style="s2">here these these found it and it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.629" end="00:32:38.659" style="s2">here Zack the meta cherry at all 2015</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:40.029" style="s2">paper and that&#39;s all I have written here</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.659" end="00:32:46.549" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna have to look at the screen</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.029" end="00:32:50.029" style="s2">it was I&#39;m getting a signal dad I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.549" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">sure what the signals mean great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.029" end="00:32:55.789" style="s2">too far away for me to see though so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:57.019" style="s2">this is this is an article from five</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.789" end="00:32:59.210" style="s2">years ago as a totally legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.019" end="00:33:01.310" style="s2">article from five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.210" end="00:33:04.940" style="s2">saying look there&#39;s there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.310" end="00:33:06.830" style="s2">problem with coronaviruses that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.940" end="00:33:08.660" style="s2">probably latent in bats and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.830" end="00:33:11.660" style="s2">be thinking more about what the risks</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.660" end="00:33:14.330" style="s2">are so this we&#39;ve seen this from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.660" end="00:33:18.020" style="s2">number of places now this is this was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.330" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">real risk so the the moral there is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.020" end="00:33:23.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this 2020 paper that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:25.910" style="s2">supposedly got pulled down from a site a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.540" end="00:33:28.790" style="s2">couple months ago did or did not exist</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.910" end="00:33:31.910" style="s2">was created for the purposes of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.790" end="00:33:34.550" style="s2">know what but it has a legitimate list</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:36.410" style="s2">of references which are actual real</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:38.450" style="s2">papers that exist in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.410" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">literature so how are we assessing</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.450" end="00:33:44.360" style="s2">information right now you have to follow</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:47.780" style="s2">a lot of different threads and often do</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.360" end="00:33:49.820" style="s2">backup for yourself alright this raises</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.780" end="00:33:53.030" style="s2">two issues one of which I realize is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.820" end="00:33:57.560" style="s2">correction I wanted to deliver that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.030" end="00:33:59.540" style="s2">missed up top okay we said in a earlier</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.560" end="00:34:01.220" style="s2">live stream that it was likely that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.540" end="00:34:04.220" style="s2">something like the hunting of deer in</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.220" end="00:34:07.460" style="s2">North America yes was safe</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.220" end="00:34:10.790" style="s2">several people responded to us reminding</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.460" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">us of wasting disease which is a prion</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.790" end="00:34:18.490" style="s2">disease that is now ravaging the deer</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:23.000" style="s2">population and prion diseases are very</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.490" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">interesting these are transmissible</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.000" end="00:34:27.530" style="s2">communicable diseases that do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:31.070" style="s2">DNA or RNA component they are basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.530" end="00:34:33.110" style="s2">a miss folding of a protein that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.070" end="00:34:36.110" style="s2">triggers the miss folding of other like</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.110" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">proteins and that is the cause or prion</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.110" end="00:34:43.460" style="s2">diseases are the cause of of mad cow</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:45.409" style="s2">disease and kuru so these are prior</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.460" end="00:34:47.179" style="s2">examples so anyway it may indeed be very</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.409" end="00:34:50.570" style="s2">dangerous yeah at the moment to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.179" end="00:34:54.980" style="s2">eating deer or certain parts of deer and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.570" end="00:34:57.170" style="s2">so our our sense that deer we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.980" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">probably safe is is off enough that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.170" end="00:35:03.380" style="s2">bears mentioning here but when we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:05.840" style="s2">talking about this you predicted to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.380" end="00:35:08.060" style="s2">you hypothesize that the fact that deer</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.840" end="00:35:10.070" style="s2">have now become dangerous to eat is</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.060" end="00:35:11.600" style="s2">almost certainly going to be the result</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.070" end="00:35:13.400" style="s2">of something that humans have done</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.600" end="00:35:15.950" style="s2">the relationship between humans and deer</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.400" end="00:35:19.550" style="s2">that it has not been dangerous for</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.950" end="00:35:21.770" style="s2">humans to hunt and eat deer for the mmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.550" end="00:35:24.020" style="s2">call it 18 thousand years or so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.770" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">humans have indeed been hunting deer and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.020" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">eating them in North America yep</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:32.990" style="s2">okay um the second thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:35.420" style="s2">address has to do with the fact so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.990" end="00:35:39.710" style="s2">were talking about the evaluation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.420" end="00:35:42.770" style="s2">sources yeah and that is basically you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.710" end="00:35:44.570" style="s2">know is the paper real does it say what</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.770" end="00:35:46.250" style="s2">is being claimed about it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.570" end="00:35:47.810" style="s2">deeper problem which has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:49.670" style="s2">quality of data and we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.810" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">this a number of times but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.670" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">things that is causing this situation to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:57.640" style="s2">be far worse than it otherwise would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:36:00.470" style="s2">is that we can&#39;t actually say for sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.640" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">what has taken place because the data</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.470" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">itself is so low-quality it&#39;s in many</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.210" style="s2">ways extremely noisy but worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.960" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">it contains systematic biases that may</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.210" end="00:36:12.260" style="s2">come from the fact that different</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:14.060" style="s2">countries report things differently</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.260" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">record them differently that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.060" end="00:36:18.740" style="s2">political interests of leaders and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:20.390" style="s2">countries that they represent may cause</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:23.210" style="s2">them to bias the data in one way or</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.390" end="00:36:25.730" style="s2">another which is blinding us to what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.210" end="00:36:30.050" style="s2">actually taking place and I raised this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.730" end="00:36:32.690" style="s2">because many of you will have heard an</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.050" end="00:36:35.300" style="s2">important story where an admiral who had</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.690" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">been told to keep his aircraft carrier</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.300" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">at sea docked in Guam chastising his</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">superiors now he did this in a letter</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:46.070" style="s2">that I believe was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.590" style="s2">private and it was then leaked and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.070" end="00:36:51.170" style="s2">has now been relieved of duty but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.590" end="00:36:53.620" style="s2">wanted to make the following very</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.170" end="00:36:56.990" style="s2">difficult and uncomfortable point I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.620" end="00:36:59.590" style="s2">can&#39;t say one way or the other what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.990" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2">situation on an aircraft carrier is and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.590" end="00:37:04.130" style="s2">what the wisdom of keeping it at sea</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">would have been I&#39;m sympathetic to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.130" end="00:37:10.610" style="s2">I read in this letter that sailors were</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">being put in grave danger for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.610" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">that might make sense during wartime but</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:19.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t make sense during peacetime</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:21.410" style="s2">that said the point at which that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.010" end="00:37:23.720" style="s2">aircraft carrier docked in Guam and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.410" end="00:37:27.380" style="s2">started offloading</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.720" end="00:37:30.410" style="s2">the crew was a lost opportunity of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.380" end="00:37:33.799" style="s2">immense proportions at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.410" end="00:37:36.500" style="s2">that crew should have been thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.799" end="00:37:38.329" style="s2">documented samples of their blood should</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.500" end="00:37:40.910" style="s2">have been taken as they left the ship</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.329" end="00:37:42.589" style="s2">before they interacted with anybody even</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.910" end="00:37:44.750" style="s2">if the tests don&#39;t exist now there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.589" end="00:37:47.420" style="s2">ways to preserve blood so that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.750" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">should be able to do retroactively both</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.420" end="00:37:52.039" style="s2">antigen both molecular testing for</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:54.559" style="s2">current infection and serology testing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.039" end="00:37:56.809" style="s2">for past infection yeah in fact all</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.559" end="00:37:58.250" style="s2">three tests could be done on blood that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.809" end="00:38:03.260" style="s2">had been stored even if the tests aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.250" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">available at the moment also very likely</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.260" end="00:38:08.630" style="s2">people should have been asked to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:10.670" style="s2">document their everything they could</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.630" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">remember about who they had interacted</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:16.819" style="s2">with what rooms they had been in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">data would surely be flawed but if it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.819" end="00:38:21.109" style="s2">was noisy rather than biased in any</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.920" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">given direction this would give us some</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.109" end="00:38:26.030" style="s2">ability to assess how the disease had</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:27.650" style="s2">moved through the hip and indeed there</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:29.660" style="s2">was something more than a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.650" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">sailors were sick with kovat 19 at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.660" end="00:38:34.210" style="s2">point of docking so that information the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">idea that there had been an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.210" end="00:38:40.430" style="s2">population that had been infected with</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:43.279" style="s2">kovat 19 and it was circulating on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.430" end="00:38:45.619" style="s2">ship provided a you know something very</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.279" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">close to a natural experiment and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.619" end="00:38:49.279" style="s2">not suggesting anybody needed to be left</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:51.500" style="s2">in danger in order to preserve it but at</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.279" end="00:38:52.789" style="s2">the point that that isolation was broken</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.500" end="00:38:56.029" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s an aircraft carrier</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.789" end="00:38:59.000" style="s2">maybe helicopters had gone to and from</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.500" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">probably as close as we would as close</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.799" style="s2">an example as we would have available to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.589" style="s2">us and the opportunity that was lost at</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.480" end="00:39:57.050" style="s2">you can&#39;t just take more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.490" end="00:39:58.370" style="s2">more data and get rid of systematic</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.050" end="00:40:00.710" style="s2">error that&#39;s not the way systematic</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.370" end="00:40:02.990" style="s2">error works random error can be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.710" end="00:40:05.300" style="s2">with more data collection but systematic</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.990" end="00:40:07.730" style="s2">error cannot yeah it&#39;s a really vital</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:58.340" style="s2">2016 just laid bare what the DNC was</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:44:03.050" style="s2">capable of and the fact that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.340" end="00:44:06.470" style="s2">appear to have learned anything in 2020</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.870" end="00:44:44.630" style="s2">arrived at a place where these parties</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:49.160" style="s2">cannot be trusted and at some level I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.630" end="00:44:53.540" style="s2">think mutiny is the only option if this</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.160" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">is the direction they insist on going do</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.540" end="00:44:56.330" style="s2">you want me to follow that up by asking</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">what you mean by mutiny or should we go</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.330" end="00:44:59.960" style="s2">to super chat no I didn&#39;t meet me is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">self-explanatory okay you can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.960" end="00:45:05.120" style="s2">what various mutinies might be available</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:09.880" style="s2">to us at some other time maybe next time</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.120" end="00:45:16.150" style="s2">yeah all right all right so super chat</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.880" end="00:45:18.950" style="s2">all right our single people so this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.150" end="00:45:23.090" style="s2">our single people living alone more or</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.950" end="00:45:24.950" style="s2">less at risk our single people living in</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.090" end="00:45:26.930" style="s2">we knew it would seem that single people</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.950" end="00:45:29.540" style="s2">living alone to the extent that they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.930" end="00:45:31.340" style="s2">self isolating they control more of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.540" end="00:45:35.960" style="s2">variables in their environment all right</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.340" end="00:45:37.880" style="s2">then yeah um anytime you anytime someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.960" end="00:45:39.650" style="s2">whom you live with walks in the door and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.880" end="00:45:42.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t know fully where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.650" end="00:45:44.600" style="s2">better health careful they&#39;ve been you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.110" end="00:45:47.360" style="s2">are being exposed to risk that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.600" end="00:45:50.270" style="s2">control so I think in general single</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.360" end="00:45:52.700" style="s2">people living alone are less at risk at</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.270" end="00:45:56.150" style="s2">least one caveat being if someone were</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.580" end="00:48:14.550" style="s2">about reflectivity and for example I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.119" end="00:48:18.660" style="s2">used to torture my classes with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.550" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">question if whiteness is the reflection</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.660" end="00:48:23.130" style="s2">of all colors of light and be a social</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">justice story no no I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.130" end="00:48:27.000" style="s2">about that kind of way I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:28.589" style="s2">the color white I guess whiteness is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.000" end="00:48:30.180" style="s2">reflection of all colors of light and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.589" end="00:48:33.000" style="s2">mirrors reflect all</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.180" end="00:48:35.940" style="s2">of light why aren&#39;t mirrors white so</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.000" end="00:48:38.100" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s gap turns out to be a an</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.940" end="00:48:39.780" style="s2">interesting little puzzle but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.100" end="00:48:40.410" style="s2">this has something to do it to to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.780" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">with it too</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.410" end="00:48:46.140" style="s2">so I guess one one thing I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:48.270" style="s2">at you and your shirt when I read the as</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.140" end="00:48:49.830" style="s2">I was thinking about the question and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.270" end="00:48:54.270" style="s2">was thinking well the shirt make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.830" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">darker because it is now denser and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.270" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">is absent</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.810" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">I think it&#39;s going to have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.060" end="00:49:08.910" style="s2">the fact that the light is bouncing off</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">the surface of the water in concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.910" end="00:49:13.050" style="s2">places which is then denying the light</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:15.420" style="s2">to other places so if you imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:17.220" style="s2">ripples on the surface of the water so</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.420" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">it effectively core gates the surface</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.220" end="00:49:22.740" style="s2">rather than having it be a smooth</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:25.050" style="s2">reflective sheen again let me do reserve</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.740" end="00:49:27.000" style="s2">some time in the next livestream to walk</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.050" end="00:49:28.890" style="s2">this back when that turns out not to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.000" end="00:49:31.110" style="s2">the answer but yes I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.890" end="00:49:34.080" style="s2">concentration of light if you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.110" end="00:49:36.840" style="s2">about a curved water surface a ripple</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.080" end="00:49:39.060" style="s2">the curved water surface is going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.840" end="00:49:40.470" style="s2">send the light depending upon where the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.060" end="00:49:42.180" style="s2">light is coming from it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.470" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">angle of incidence equals angle of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.180" end="00:49:46.350" style="s2">reflection and so the light will end up</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:49.410" style="s2">as a stripe of light and if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.350" end="00:49:51.990" style="s2">like a brick and you pour water on and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.410" end="00:49:55.080" style="s2">it gets darker it gets darker but you</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.990" end="00:49:56.670" style="s2">will see places that have the light</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.080" end="00:49:58.320" style="s2">reflecting off them so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.670" end="00:49:59.940" style="s2">going to be same number of photons but</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.320" end="00:50:01.590" style="s2">they&#39;re concentrated in some places and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.940" end="00:50:03.240" style="s2">denied to others okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.590" end="00:50:05.880" style="s2">why I got asked that I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.240" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">because they can&#39;t because they can&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.980" end="00:54:47.950" style="s2">clearly a retrovirus and the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.930" end="00:54:53.420" style="s2">you would find components of HIV</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.980" end="00:54:59.480" style="s2">guess would be the result is erroneous</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.480" end="00:55:05.650" style="s2">means but who knows I will also say in</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.680" end="00:55:13.009" style="s2">learning something about non retrovirus</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.650" end="00:55:14.869" style="s2">RNA viruses the third category of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.009" end="00:55:19.220" style="s2">actually does involve a mechanism for</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.220" end="00:55:24.099" style="s2">able to exchange components so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.589" end="00:55:28.009" style="s2">kind of analog to exchange components</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.099" end="00:55:29.569" style="s2">between virus instances yes now you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.009" end="00:55:31.190" style="s2">have two different lineages of flu and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.569" end="00:55:33.529" style="s2">they can exchange components which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.190" end="00:55:36.049" style="s2">why you have this like h1 and one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.529" end="00:55:39.170" style="s2">like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a Lego set that you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.049" end="00:55:39.800" style="s2">mix and match parts so anyway I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.170" end="00:55:43.010" style="s2">think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.800" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">that capacity exists between something</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.010" end="00:55:50.330" style="s2">like a HIV retrovirus and coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:52.190" style="s2">but you would have to have something</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.330" end="00:55:54.770" style="s2">like that in order for true components</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.190" end="00:55:58.870" style="s2">of HIV to show up in a coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.770" end="00:56:01.310" style="s2">context without human meddling yeah good</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.230" end="00:56:26.150" style="s2">aggressive members fascinating yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.910" end="00:56:28.700" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that war culls our most</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.150" end="00:56:31.460" style="s2">aggressive members I do think it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.700" end="00:56:33.680" style="s2">been deployed as a kind of culling force</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.460" end="00:56:36.290" style="s2">and I&#39;ve talked about this elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.680" end="00:56:39.110" style="s2">that basically lineage level selection</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.290" end="00:56:41.690" style="s2">results in populations that have reached</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.110" end="00:56:47.210" style="s2">a limit to the resources available to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.690" end="00:56:48.710" style="s2">them engage in behaviors that alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.210" end="00:56:50.300" style="s2">those limits from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.710" end="00:56:53.120" style="s2">the population in question and one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.300" end="00:56:54.740" style="s2">them certainly coming up with a reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.120" end="00:56:56.600" style="s2">to make war on some population that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.740" end="00:57:00.320" style="s2">can&#39;t defend itself but for instance</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.600" end="00:57:02.090" style="s2">absent the draft the people who who</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.320" end="00:57:03.740" style="s2">enroll aren&#39;t inherently the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.090" end="00:57:06.100" style="s2">aggressive they may be more desperate</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.740" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">than the average people who don&#39;t enlist</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.100" end="00:57:11.060" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a calling of people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:12.830" style="s2">don&#39;t have as much opportunity in</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.060" end="00:57:14.330" style="s2">society not necessarily people who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.830" end="00:57:16.220" style="s2">more aggressive or who start out more</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.330" end="00:57:18.350" style="s2">aggressive yes in fact I think our</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.220" end="00:57:19.820" style="s2">society neatly separates these things</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.350" end="00:57:21.110" style="s2">we&#39;re the most aggressive people are the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.820" end="00:57:22.520" style="s2">people who know that they can get away</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.110" end="00:57:26.360" style="s2">with it and don&#39;t pay the price of</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.730" end="00:58:06.200" style="s2">I think it&#39;s what the acronym stands for</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.200" end="00:58:10.490" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about we the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.670" end="00:58:12.200" style="s2">country here I presume after creating a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.490" end="00:58:13.940" style="s2">pandemic response team why wasn&#39;t the</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.940" end="00:58:17.810" style="s2">supply of PPE just goes to show even the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.430" end="00:58:23.180" style="s2">best minds in the field can miss the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.810" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">obvious yeah so I would say yes but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.180" end="00:58:29.630" style="s2">even more disturbed that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:32.630" style="s2">manufacturing capacity that can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.630" end="00:58:35.420" style="s2">caused to produce that which is needed</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.630" end="00:58:37.640" style="s2">the personal protective equipment is one</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.420" end="00:58:39.620" style="s2">thing that one can obviously need but</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.640" end="00:58:43.400" style="s2">the list of things one might suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.620" end="00:58:45.380" style="s2">need are indefinitely large and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.400" end="00:58:48.380" style="s2">that these things are all being produced</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.380" end="00:58:50.500" style="s2">in one region of the world become a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.380" end="00:58:54.710" style="s2">nation of buyers rather than makers</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:57.470" style="s2">right and it is an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.710" end="00:59:00.530" style="s2">vulnerability and it&#39;s needless the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.470" end="00:59:05.600" style="s2">is as the manufacturing capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.530" end="00:59:07.490" style="s2">US was being offshored it was known it</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.600" end="00:59:10.040" style="s2">was actively discussed that this was</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.490" end="00:59:13.460" style="s2">dangerous to us as a nation and so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.040" end="00:59:15.470" style="s2">think those those discussions have been</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.460" end="00:59:17.240" style="s2">forgotten but nonetheless people</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.470" end="00:59:19.820" style="s2">understood this was dangerous it now</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.240" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">clearly is dangerous let&#39;s undo it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.820" end="00:59:25.580" style="s2">and and really so this this one should</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">be obvious now to most people how many</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.580" end="00:59:30.350" style="s2">more of those how many more things have</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:32.060" style="s2">been allowed to lapse that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.350" end="00:59:35.600" style="s2">need not to lapse that&#39;s what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.060" end="00:59:36.770" style="s2">be thinking about thanks for doing these</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.600" end="00:59:38.660" style="s2">how confident do you feel that this</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.770" end="00:59:40.280" style="s2">crisis will spur national reinvestment</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.660" end="00:59:43.370" style="s2">in the sciences on the 5 to 10 year</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.280" end="00:59:51.980" style="s2">scale can scientifically leverage this</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.370" end="00:59:53.480" style="s2">and how you you start well lost the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.980" end="00:59:56.150" style="s2">question I would say the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.480" end="00:59:59.150" style="s2">problem is that our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.150" end="01:00:01.190" style="s2">institutions are not healthy and this</p>

<p begin="01:00:01.190" end="01:00:05.750" style="s2">me to make because somehow any issue</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.760" end="01:00:08.420" style="s2">that break</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.750" end="01:00:10.670" style="s2">down to two sides to the extent you want</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.670" end="01:00:15.020" style="s2">seen to be the enemy so as champions of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.490" end="01:00:17.090" style="s2">science for us to say actually our</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.020" end="01:00:19.220" style="s2">scientific institutions aren&#39;t healthy</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.220" end="01:00:23.900" style="s2">be fixed is taken as an attack on</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.500" end="01:00:25.670" style="s2">science but I mean part of the problem I</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.900" end="01:00:28.100" style="s2">think and I think you started here you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.670" end="01:00:32.480" style="s2">implied it is that higher ed is broken</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.100" end="01:00:34.100" style="s2">and the easiest target when talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.480" end="01:00:36.320" style="s2">about what&#39;s broken in higher ed is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.100" end="01:00:38.630" style="s2">the sciences it&#39;s obvious to almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.320" end="01:00:40.460" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s outside of the the so</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.630" end="01:00:43.850" style="s2">called grievance studies fields that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.460" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">those fields are ridiculous right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.850" end="01:00:47.990" style="s2">day that they are doing great damage and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.710" style="s2">that they have no business being in</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.990" end="01:00:53.000" style="s2">higher ed and if you contrast them</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.710" end="01:00:54.410" style="s2">simply with the sciences and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.000" end="01:00:55.670" style="s2">fair contrast because you know where did</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.410" end="01:00:58.430" style="s2">the arts show up which are you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.670" end="01:01:00.110" style="s2">important and necessary as well and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.430" end="01:01:02.990" style="s2">legitimate humanities and legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.110" end="01:01:05.330" style="s2">social sciences but if it&#39;s sciences</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.990" end="01:01:07.490" style="s2">versus grievant Studies obviously you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.330" end="01:01:08.900" style="s2">going to pick Sciences but what if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.490" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">you know if we start talking about P</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.900" end="01:01:12.890" style="s2">hacking in the replica and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:15.320" style="s2">replication crisis and you know every</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.890" end="01:01:17.210" style="s2">end the fact that NSF and NIH are</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.320" end="01:01:19.310" style="s2">effectively funding most scientists in</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.210" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">the in the u.s. anyway and so it&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.310" end="01:01:23.030" style="s2">you aren&#39;t actually allowed to ask the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:25.820" style="s2">questions you want inherently and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.030" end="01:01:27.410" style="s2">aren&#39;t encouraged particularly to do low</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.820" end="01:01:29.270" style="s2">tech research because then your</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.410" end="01:01:31.250" style="s2">university doesn&#39;t get the 40 to 80</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.270" end="01:01:34.550" style="s2">percent overhead from the grants and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.250" end="01:01:37.690" style="s2">on and on and on and on it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.550" end="01:01:41.780" style="s2">healthy scene so will the science</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.690" end="01:01:44.930" style="s2">departments want to make hay out of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.780" end="01:01:48.020" style="s2">sure and should we have more better</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.930" end="01:01:50.350" style="s2">science absolutely a hundred percent how</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.020" end="01:01:53.270" style="s2">to turn this how to make the science</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.350" end="01:01:57.350" style="s2">healthy and robust and rigorous though</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.270" end="01:01:59.450" style="s2">is tough well I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tough</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.350" end="01:02:00.680" style="s2">we&#39;re a long way from the system</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.450" end="01:02:04.250" style="s2">functioning and most of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.680" end="01:02:05.900" style="s2">inhabit our scientific system wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.250" end="01:02:07.790" style="s2">know what to do which is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.900" end="01:02:10.340" style="s2">problem so that&#39;s that&#39;s the tough part</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.790" end="01:02:12.890" style="s2">is it&#39;s going to take time to repopulate</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.340" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">the system with people who have the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.890" end="01:02:17.630" style="s2">correct instincts you know I mean a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:19.279" style="s2">of people in the system could switch if</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.630" end="01:02:20.989" style="s2">the incentives changed</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.279" end="01:02:23.569" style="s2">and they were actually being rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.989" end="01:02:25.519" style="s2">for challenging things rather than for</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.569" end="01:02:28.959" style="s2">doing brick in the wall science and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.519" end="01:02:31.489" style="s2">keeping their mouths quiet but and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.959" end="01:02:34.099" style="s2">being a bit authoritarian as well you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.489" end="01:02:35.599" style="s2">know well I&#39;ve once once I have a PhD in</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.099" end="01:02:36.739" style="s2">a science you&#39;re supposed to trust me</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.599" end="01:02:38.089" style="s2">because now I&#39;m wearing a lab coat and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.739" end="01:02:39.799" style="s2">I&#39;m a scientist like no that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.089" end="01:02:41.659" style="s2">exactly the opposite of what science is</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.799" end="01:02:43.429" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to trust someone on</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.659" end="01:02:46.519" style="s2">the base of their scientist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.429" end="01:02:48.259" style="s2">supposed to at some point after they</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.519" end="01:02:49.999" style="s2">have demonstrated over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.259" end="01:02:52.459" style="s2">again that they are doing good science</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.999" end="01:02:53.809" style="s2">begin to say okay I will listen to that</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.459" end="01:02:55.459" style="s2">person more than I&#39;ll listen to this</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.809" end="01:02:56.329" style="s2">other person because I&#39;ve seen that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.459" end="01:02:59.269" style="s2">actually know what the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.329" end="01:03:01.130" style="s2">process is and that they are constantly</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.269" end="01:03:03.319" style="s2">trying to falsify their own most</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.130" end="01:03:05.659" style="s2">precious assumptions and that is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.319" end="01:03:08.929" style="s2">what most scientists do you know in fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.659" end="01:03:10.939" style="s2">you see this quite clearly over and over</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.929" end="01:03:13.400" style="s2">in climate change space right where too</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.939" end="01:03:15.679" style="s2">many climate change scientists most of</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.400" end="01:03:18.140" style="s2">whom are presumably rigorous and careful</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.679" end="01:03:19.579" style="s2">will say we you know don&#39;t question the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.140" end="01:03:21.469" style="s2">models you know no one can understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.579" end="01:03:22.789" style="s2">them but us of course we have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.469" end="01:03:24.049" style="s2">question the models of course and of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.789" end="01:03:24.949" style="s2">course there will be some bad science</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.049" end="01:03:26.390" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out of that just like</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.949" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">there&#39;s bad science coming out of every</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.390" end="01:03:31.159" style="s2">single field there&#39;s bad science there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:33.949" style="s2">bad X coming out of every Y that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.159" end="01:03:36.229" style="s2">the way of the world I think the thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.949" end="01:03:37.819" style="s2">people should do is imagine that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.229" end="01:03:40.279" style="s2">systems that they are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.819" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">observing you know politics journalism</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.279" end="01:03:43.249" style="s2">these sorts of things they can see how</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:45.499" style="s2">sick they are</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.249" end="01:03:47.269" style="s2">now imagine science is just as sick</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.499" end="01:03:49.309" style="s2">right that&#39;s a really frightening</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.269" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">thought but it for those of us who have</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.309" end="01:03:55.849" style="s2">seen it from the inside there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:58.849" style="s2">that is wrong and many of us have been</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.849" end="01:04:01.640" style="s2">trying to raise the alarm and just to no</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.849" end="01:04:03.619" style="s2">avail so anyway it&#39;s a big problem and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.640" end="01:04:07.339" style="s2">it must be addressed because it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.619" end="01:04:10.699" style="s2">us incredibly vulnerable yep one hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.339" end="01:04:11.209" style="s2">okay well we said we were gonna stop at</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.699" end="01:04:14.689" style="s2">one hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.209" end="01:04:16.069" style="s2">let us what do we do I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.689" end="01:04:17.989" style="s2">finish up with the questions we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.069" end="01:04:19.669" style="s2">finish the questions we&#39;ve got okay so</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.989" end="01:04:21.229" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go we&#39;re gonna finish the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.669" end="01:04:22.969" style="s2">questions we&#39;ve got we&#39;re gonna try to</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.229" end="01:04:25.479" style="s2">do it quickly and I&#39;m gonna let you read</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.969" end="01:04:27.709" style="s2">so that they never realize I&#39;m Dyslexic</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.869" end="01:04:48.049" style="s2">just a comment oh wait did I know okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.660" end="01:04:50.660" style="s2">we got that one could an infected person</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.049" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">get long-term negative effects I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.660" end="01:04:53.809" style="s2">to start over could an infected person</p>

<p begin="01:04:56.150" end="01:05:00.619" style="s2">were present quite possible we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.700" end="01:05:02.239" style="s2">know and it&#39;s not just that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.619" end="01:05:04.069" style="s2">know the world does not know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.239" end="01:05:06.529" style="s2">to this so but there is nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.069" end="01:05:09.769" style="s2">suggest that it is impossible that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.529" end="01:05:11.180" style="s2">asymptomatic carrier could not end up</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.769" end="01:05:13.609" style="s2">with long-term effects so there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.180" end="01:05:16.099" style="s2">things we can say yeah one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.609" end="01:05:18.650" style="s2">that is true in general of something</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.099" end="01:05:21.469" style="s2">like a respiratory virus is that what</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.650" end="01:05:23.869" style="s2">happens is you get infected you get a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.469" end="01:05:26.089" style="s2">lesion some colony of cells that has</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.869" end="01:05:29.089" style="s2">been overtaken by the virus that then</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.089" end="01:05:31.400" style="s2">starts malfunctioning and spilling out</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.089" end="01:05:34.039" style="s2">virus that creates essentially a wound</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.400" end="01:05:36.739" style="s2">and that wound is a large part of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.039" end="01:05:39.170" style="s2">pathology that you are experiencing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.739" end="01:05:40.759" style="s2">reason you may have a lingering cough</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.170" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">after something is that you&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.759" end="01:05:44.269" style="s2">of these wounds and it takes a long time</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:46.849" style="s2">for them to heal so your nerves are</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.269" end="01:05:49.249" style="s2">being stimulated badly so it is likely</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.849" end="01:05:51.859" style="s2">that the less symptomatic you are the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.249" end="01:05:53.799" style="s2">lasting damage you&#39;ve sustained but it</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.859" end="01:05:55.640" style="s2">is not certain that the damage is zero</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.340" end="01:07:22.570" style="s2">to pass yep</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.270" end="01:07:30.560" style="s2">can the virus survive for significantly</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.190" end="01:07:34.520" style="s2">longer if on plastic packaging in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.560" end="01:07:36.020" style="s2">freezer almost no doubt they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.520" end="01:07:38.720" style="s2">longer compared to what how do you read</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.020" end="01:07:39.800" style="s2">that either not on plastic packaging or</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:41.180" style="s2">outside the freezer</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.800" end="01:07:42.500" style="s2">you think it&#39;ll you think it&#39;ll survive</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.180" end="01:07:43.790" style="s2">for longer in the freezer than outside</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.500" end="01:07:45.560" style="s2">of the freezer I mean the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.790" end="01:07:47.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that freezers play the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.560" end="01:07:49.490" style="s2">role they do it&#39;s just they slow down</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.150" end="01:07:52.970" style="s2">every chemical process and they also</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.490" end="01:07:54.020" style="s2">kill some things I mean they kill you</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.970" end="01:07:56.750" style="s2">know the reason they can kill these</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.020" end="01:07:58.040" style="s2">things cells that break apart as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.750" end="01:08:01.880" style="s2">result of the fact that the water in</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.040" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">them expands but for something as inert</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.880" end="01:08:06.710" style="s2">as a virus I can&#39;t say the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:09.140" style="s2">of it is zero but I think the chances</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.710" end="01:08:10.790" style="s2">that you can preserve this virus in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.140" end="01:08:12.790" style="s2">freezer are high presumably somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.790" end="01:08:16.130" style="s2">presumably that as well understood</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.790" end="01:08:17.719" style="s2">amongst people who study over 19 and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.130" end="01:08:19.790" style="s2">coronaviruses I mean they all have this</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.719" end="01:08:23.509" style="s2">same sort of is it a lipid coat you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.790" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">and so yeah I may think to be safe soap</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.509" end="01:08:28.390" style="s2">is soap is magic and you know it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:30.500" style="s2">actually magic is actually chemistry but</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.390" end="01:08:31.880" style="s2">washing anything that you&#39;re gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.500" end="01:08:34.430" style="s2">in the freezer that&#39;s wrapped in plastic</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.880" end="01:08:35.900" style="s2">plastic and soap first it cost you</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.430" end="01:08:37.969" style="s2">almost nothing it doesn&#39;t put the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.900" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">inside the plastic at risk and then you</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.969" end="01:08:42.549" style="s2">know when you pull it out that it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:45.799" style="s2">it&#39;s clear yeah and if the stuff went in</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.549" end="01:08:48.140" style="s2">since the Cova 19 epidemic and it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.799" end="01:08:50.390" style="s2">been washed just treated since before do</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.140" end="01:08:52.489" style="s2">you mean no if it went in since yeah oh</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.390" end="01:08:54.739" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t have virus on it and nobody</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.489" end="01:08:55.429" style="s2">washed it before it went in treated a</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.739" end="01:08:56.989" style="s2">suspect the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.429" end="01:08:59.989" style="s2">you win a package that arrives at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.989" end="01:09:03.349" style="s2">door yeah stay safe I think they say no</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.989" end="01:09:05.029" style="s2">it&#39;s not how we roll safety third as I</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.349" end="01:09:07.219" style="s2">was saying to my students right there</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.029" end="01:09:08.929" style="s2">you go have you seen the FBI reports</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.219" end="01:09:10.939" style="s2">from last September of Chinese nationals</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.929" end="01:09:13.219" style="s2">flying into the US with unclaimed vials</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.939" end="01:09:15.259" style="s2">containing viral strains no I have not</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.219" end="01:09:17.329" style="s2">have you nope no I haven&#39;t encountered</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.259" end="01:09:18.679" style="s2">it how should the worldwide fragility we</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.329" end="01:09:20.359" style="s2">are now witnessing influence our</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.679" end="01:09:23.929" style="s2">relationship with new technologies a</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.359" end="01:09:27.459" style="s2">gray goo yeah extinction event comes to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.929" end="01:09:27.459" style="s2">mind I love the stream stay safe guys</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.179" end="01:09:33.829" style="s2">read more about this in our book when it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.009" end="01:09:36.469" style="s2">comes out there is clearly something</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.829" end="01:09:39.079" style="s2">about the precautionary principle that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.469" end="01:09:40.369" style="s2">drives people crazy but those of us who</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.079" end="01:09:43.729" style="s2">have thought deeply about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.369" end="01:09:46.339" style="s2">overwhelming novelty of the technology</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.729" end="01:09:48.920" style="s2">that we are encountering know that some</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.339" end="01:09:50.719" style="s2">version no sorry sorry interrupt but not</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.920" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">just the overwhelming extent of novelty</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.719" end="01:09:54.619" style="s2">but the overwhelming rate at which</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:56.989" style="s2">novelty is evolving yes the novel rate</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.619" end="01:09:59.539" style="s2">of novelty is a lethal threat to</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.989" end="01:10:02.689" style="s2">humanity which means that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.539" end="01:10:05.179" style="s2">navigate a path we cannot be paralyzed</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.689" end="01:10:07.189" style="s2">by some sort of sense that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.179" end="01:10:10.429" style="s2">organization of the sand in any</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.189" end="01:10:13.070" style="s2">particular vacant lot is you know can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.429" end="01:10:17.119" style="s2">be altered but the principle I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.070" end="01:10:19.489" style="s2">is one of reversibility yes you should</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.119" end="01:10:22.880" style="s2">not engage in anything that you could</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.489" end="01:10:24.829" style="s2">not reverse if absolutely necessary can</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.880" end="01:10:27.260" style="s2">you make a golf course yes but could you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.829" end="01:10:30.530" style="s2">reverse a golf course if you had to yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.260" end="01:10:32.539" style="s2">so the point is the danger of the golf</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.530" end="01:10:36.409" style="s2">course is limited by the fact that if it</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.539" end="01:10:38.030" style="s2">had to be undone it could be so this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.409" end="01:10:41.689" style="s2">a problem there are lots of things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.030" end="01:10:43.099" style="s2">we can&#39;t undo and those are the ones</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.689" end="01:10:45.829" style="s2">that we should worry most about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.099" end="01:10:49.249" style="s2">release of a novel pathogen is something</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.829" end="01:10:52.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t undo the release of a species</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.249" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">into a habitat where it invades is</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.280" end="01:10:56.389" style="s2">something you can&#39;t undo so the danger</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:58.849" style="s2">of these things is immense relative to</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.389" end="01:11:00.079" style="s2">things that you think are safe could</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.849" end="01:11:02.199" style="s2">turn out not to be and if absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.079" end="01:11:06.979" style="s2">necessary humanity could roll them back</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.199" end="01:11:08.419" style="s2">good someone says he can he&#39;s willing of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.979" end="01:11:10.369" style="s2">his brain picked</p>

<p begin="01:14:00.560" end="01:14:06.349" style="s2">one from this yeah okay do you think</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.349" end="01:14:09.860" style="s2">do you think viruses co-evolved with</p>

<p begin="01:14:33.679" end="01:14:38.060" style="s2">feel like I should and really a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.170" end="01:14:42.639" style="s2">more would help me remember what it is</p>

<p begin="01:15:43.380" end="01:15:46.199" style="s2">sure billboards</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.159" end="01:15:47.370" style="s2">yeah probably video billboards yeah</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.370" end="01:15:52.350" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly lined with a video it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.020" end="01:15:56.130" style="s2">lined yeah as well yeah what came first</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.350" end="01:15:58.590" style="s2">a virus or a cell it&#39;s gotta be a cell</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.130" end="01:16:00.210" style="s2">got to be a cell got to be a cell given</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.659" end="01:16:17.940" style="s2">we know yet it&#39;s very hard to imagine</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.940" end="01:16:22.380" style="s2">hit harder as a result of them being</p>

<p begin="01:16:22.380" end="01:16:26.100" style="s2">that they&#39;re correlated with societies</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.969" end="01:16:28.469" style="s2">that have some other vulnerability but</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.100" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">clearly it&#39;s all smaller much smaller</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.469" end="01:16:33.960" style="s2">than what&#39;s going on in the u.s. in</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.960" end="01:16:35.940" style="s2">terms of economy yeah but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.960" end="01:16:39.330" style="s2">we have the data to know this I just</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.940" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">think the fact is if you get covered 19</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.330" end="01:16:43.350" style="s2">you&#39;re almost certain to be downstream</p>

<p begin="01:16:43.350" end="01:16:49.790" style="s2">health care if you&#39;re in the US because</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.570" end="01:16:52.920" style="s2">so many people have not had access so</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.790" end="01:16:55.409" style="s2">anyway it you know that health care is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.920" end="01:16:58.860" style="s2">very important thing for us to engineer</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.409" end="01:17:02.100" style="s2">on the far side of this catastrophe yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.860" end="01:17:04.380" style="s2">there were failures at every level here</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.100" end="01:17:07.440" style="s2">you know including the fact in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.380" end="01:17:09.719" style="s2">of many people not having access to good</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.440" end="01:17:11.310" style="s2">health care please assign mods for the</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.719" end="01:17:13.260" style="s2">chatter have Zack Maude Zack can&#39;t he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.310" end="01:17:15.390" style="s2">too busy doing all this other stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.260" end="01:17:18.390" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it we are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.390" end="01:17:20.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a downside to mods</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.390" end="01:17:23.010" style="s2">which is that you somehow end up taking</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.840" end="01:17:25.949" style="s2">responsibility for those you have chosen</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.010" end="01:17:28.230" style="s2">and anyway this has been raised to us as</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.949" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">a potential hazard but if if you the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.230" end="01:17:33.750" style="s2">audience will be good about accepting</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:37.110" style="s2">that we will pick good people we will do</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.750" end="01:17:41.460" style="s2">so honorably and hopefully they will do</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.110" end="01:17:43.980" style="s2">an excellent job and then then mods are</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.460" end="01:17:46.020" style="s2">probably the way to go yeah we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.980" end="01:17:46.980" style="s2">don&#39;t see the chat so we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.020" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s going but</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.980" end="01:17:51.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard that it sometimes goes off</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">the rail says these things do to more do</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.390" end="01:17:55.800" style="s2">you have anything do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.940" style="s2">thoughts on the rat city experiments so</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.800" end="01:17:58.020" style="s2">far I don&#39;t know what those are</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.940" end="01:17:59.340" style="s2">do you think there are negative</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.020" end="01:18:01.320" style="s2">implications and mammals with high</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.340" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">population densities seems like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.320" end="01:18:05.370" style="s2">dovetails with both pandemic and sjw</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:08.790" style="s2">issues do you know what the rat city</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.370" end="01:18:11.100" style="s2">experiments are I do but I do not know</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.790" end="01:18:14.270" style="s2">them well enough that I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.100" end="01:18:19.050" style="s2">speculating about them I do think</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.270" end="01:18:20.850" style="s2">novelty is dangerous that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.050" end="01:18:23.360" style="s2">rat city experiments if I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.850" end="01:18:28.530" style="s2">right set of experiments in mind</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.360" end="01:18:32.100" style="s2">involved the production of basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.530" end="01:18:35.970" style="s2">colonies that were wrapped colonies</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.100" end="01:18:39.330" style="s2">rad-con so anyway yes high population</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.970" end="01:18:40.920" style="s2">densities are carry various dangers the</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.330" end="01:18:42.420" style="s2">conditions that you set up in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.920" end="01:18:44.880" style="s2">experiment matter a lot but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.420" end="01:18:48.930" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s much to say beyond</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.880" end="01:18:50.700" style="s2">that okay and final question is it true</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.930" end="01:18:52.410" style="s2">that a mask would worn for 15 minutes or</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.700" end="01:18:55.200" style="s2">so becomes useless and protecting the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.410" end="01:18:58.470" style="s2">person due to moisture from breath no</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.200" end="01:19:05.340" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine it can&#39;t not not how it</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.470" end="01:19:07.590" style="s2">works I mean one thing this depends even</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.340" end="01:19:09.810" style="s2">if even if they were truth to that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.590" end="01:19:11.280" style="s2">some climate in some other climate</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.810" end="01:19:15.989" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna reach an equilibrium where</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.280" end="01:19:18.450" style="s2">the thing never saturates I would say so</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.989" end="01:19:20.730" style="s2">your point here is even if it were true</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.450" end="01:19:21.750" style="s2">but a saturated mask wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.730" end="01:19:23.340" style="s2">effective yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.750" end="01:19:24.630" style="s2">the rate at which would become saturated</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.340" end="01:19:26.520" style="s2">would depend on environmental conditions</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.630" end="01:19:27.989" style="s2">and therefore there couldn&#39;t be a number</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.520" end="01:19:30.239" style="s2">like 15 minutes that would be the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.989" end="01:19:32.910" style="s2">number but we are separately saying as</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.239" end="01:19:35.130" style="s2">well that neither of us thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.910" end="01:19:39.330" style="s2">saturation of a mask is going to render</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.130" end="01:19:42.180" style="s2">it render it useless and in fact this</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.330" end="01:19:46.020" style="s2">result that I said in passing last time</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.180" end="01:19:48.090" style="s2">about masks that have have a membrane</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.020" end="01:19:51.560" style="s2">the saline membrane in them are actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.090" end="01:19:54.390" style="s2">far more effective yeah that basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.560" end="01:19:55.920" style="s2">when the virus hits the salt the</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.390" end="01:19:58.610" style="s2">combination of the salt the virus and</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.920" end="01:20:00.830" style="s2">the water basically causes the salt</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.610" end="01:20:05.700" style="s2">denature isn&#39;t quite the right word but</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.830" end="01:20:08.820" style="s2">denature the virus yep or bind it up in</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.700" end="01:20:11.010" style="s2">any way it binds it yeah so I would just</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.820" end="01:20:12.900" style="s2">say there&#39;s something wrong with a claim</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.010" end="01:20:18.590" style="s2">like that I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.900" end="01:20:21.480" style="s2">hearing that claim but even if the mask</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.590" end="01:20:24.150" style="s2">saturated and that caused it not to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.480" end="01:20:27.240" style="s2">permeable to air and so air was going</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.150" end="01:20:29.220" style="s2">around it even forcing a viral particle</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.240" end="01:20:32.340" style="s2">to take a circuitous path means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.220" end="01:20:35.190" style="s2">likely to land on your cheek rather than</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.340" end="01:20:38.940" style="s2">go into your lungs so there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.190" end="01:20:41.160" style="s2">that useless is the right the right</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.940" end="01:20:45.570" style="s2">conclusion that&#39;s right does it decrease</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.160" end="01:20:47.310" style="s2">in its usefulness maybe I think with</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.570" end="01:20:48.600" style="s2">something like a bandana you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.310" end="01:20:51.240" style="s2">this because there&#39;s such a large</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.600" end="01:20:53.550" style="s2">surface area I don&#39;t detect the thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.240" end="01:20:55.110" style="s2">actually filling up with moisture at all</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.550" end="01:20:57.060" style="s2">and that was something like a bend down</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.110" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">as you said and I think our first live</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.060" end="01:21:01.050" style="s2">stream when you introduced the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:03.210" style="s2">you are wearing them you do wash them</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.050" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">every single time after you have gone</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.210" end="01:21:07.290" style="s2">out into the world absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:09.360" style="s2">I tried go into the world I&#39;d drop it</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.290" end="01:21:11.970" style="s2">and I pick up a new one and I have</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.360" end="01:21:17.220" style="s2">enough of them that I can keep that</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.970" end="01:21:21.510" style="s2">going indefinitely so it&#39;s I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.220" end="01:21:24.780" style="s2">gonna do another little video on these</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.510" end="01:21:26.720" style="s2">methods but the bottom line is don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.780" end="01:21:30.450" style="s2">helpless and when somebody hands you a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.720" end="01:21:33.740" style="s2">nonsensical claim like the mask becomes</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.450" end="01:21:35.880" style="s2">worthless after some number of minutes</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.740" end="01:21:37.290" style="s2">think carefully about whether it could</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.880" end="01:21:39.590" style="s2">possibly be right and if it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.290" end="01:21:42.690" style="s2">nonsense it almost certainly is yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.590" end="01:21:44.760" style="s2">think we&#39;re there all right we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.690" end="01:21:47.070" style="s2">back next Tuesday so we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.760" end="01:21:49.650" style="s2">doing these for now twice a week</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.070" end="01:21:51.720" style="s2">Tuesdays and Fridays 3:30 p.m. Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.650" end="01:21:54.690" style="s2">will drop to once a week at some point</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.720" end="01:21:57.120" style="s2">surely but so long as we&#39;re in lockdown</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.690" end="01:21:59.250" style="s2">the plan is to keep on going I would</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.120" end="01:22:01.140" style="s2">also say I know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.250" end="01:22:02.850" style="s2">complaints from people in Europe that</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.140" end="01:22:05.970" style="s2">these live streams are late enough in</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.850" end="01:22:08.520" style="s2">our day that they&#39;re already in bed we</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.970" end="01:22:10.980" style="s2">would love to move them earlier to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.520" end="01:22:12.690" style="s2">that the problem at the moment is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.980" end="01:22:15.179" style="s2">our kids are in</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.690" end="01:22:16.590" style="s2">school and so in order to have Zach do</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.179" end="01:22:18.030" style="s2">the important role that he&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.590" end="01:22:21.659" style="s2">here we&#39;ve had to push it to the end of</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.030" end="01:22:24.599" style="s2">the school day for him if you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.659" end="01:22:26.820" style="s2">watch these streams live they are being</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.599" end="01:22:28.770" style="s2">made available on the Dark Horse podcast</p>
