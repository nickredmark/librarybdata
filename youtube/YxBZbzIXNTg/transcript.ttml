<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">you can get into proper progressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">sequence but a quick review for all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:15.900" style="s2">us we find our Center</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">surely remember back and forth so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.900" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">decide the head we sink into a cigarette</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">center by relaxing all of our muscles by</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:27.660" style="s2">opening a chest muscles and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:30.510" style="s2">with muscle stomach muscles we savor our</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">Center by creating a felt memory of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.510" end="00:02:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like so that we can find our way</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">back and we centre our attention by</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">stepping back and looking at our</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">sensations rather than automatically</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:44.190" style="s2">looking through the patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">processes in our mind we label others</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.190" end="00:02:47.490" style="s2">when were distracted we label the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:49.830" style="s2">distracting process we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.490" end="00:02:52.220" style="s2">involved with the content we label the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.830" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">distracting process with an ing word</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:58.020" style="s2">excuse me thinking imagining wandering</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">listening etc and then we return our</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.020" end="00:03:03.210" style="s2">attention to the breath and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:03.960" style="s2">we train our attitude we&#39;re centering</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.210" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">our attitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.960" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">we&#39;re neither fighting nor feeding our</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">monkey mind because throughout all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">we are attempting to the friend</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:17.460" style="s2">ourselves so we&#39;re going to sit again in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:19.740" style="s2">a couple of minutes make sure he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.460" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">some comfortable clothing on make sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.740" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve got as we talked about last time</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:25.860" style="s2">you have your loft see I&#39;m sitting on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:29.490" style="s2">pillow because I want to get my knees</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.860" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">level or if possible below my hips some</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.490" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">of you may find it easier to sit on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">edge of your pillow right cross-legged</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">because this is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">demanding on the legs if you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">though that this is good because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">tends to keep the pelvis less</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:49.310" style="s2">lateralized remember also that although</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">you should experiment with your posture</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.310" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to find a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">posture that makes you free of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">discomfort well you&#39;ve done up your legs</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">that little bit of support from the back</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.270" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">of the chair or what some people do in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">my meditation classes is they sit right</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">centering exercise and then they lean a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">little bit back onto a wall</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">take some pressure off their back</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">alright so like I said I will be taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">some questions at the end after we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">the new questions coming in all right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:54.300" style="s2">please prepare yourself and we will</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.300" end="00:04:56.450" style="s2">meditate</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:16.830" style="s2">slowly begin to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:18.390" style="s2">practice trying as best you can to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.830" end="00:20:20.430" style="s2">integrate what you cultivated in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.390" end="00:20:24.300" style="s2">practice with your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.430" end="00:20:28.110" style="s2">consciousness and cognition meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.300" end="00:20:34.920" style="s2">is not a vacation it&#39;s an education for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.110" end="00:20:37.860" style="s2">transformation so let&#39;s take some</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.920" end="00:20:41.730" style="s2">questions right here</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.860" end="00:20:43.800" style="s2">they have a question from crema should</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.730" end="00:20:45.480" style="s2">we be focusing on our breath either the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.800" end="00:20:47.040" style="s2">tip of the nose or the belly yes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.480" end="00:20:49.680" style="s2">definitely focusing on your breath I</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.040" end="00:20:52.170" style="s2">would recommend focusing there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:54.420" style="s2">traditions that focus on the breath of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.170" end="00:20:56.280" style="s2">the tip of the nose but the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.420" end="00:21:00.140" style="s2">I&#39;m teaching a tradition that integrates</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.280" end="00:21:03.720" style="s2">for pasta and meta and touch each one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.140" end="00:21:06.510" style="s2">one that puts an emphasis on the don t</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.720" end="00:21:08.010" style="s2">and also known as the Hara and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.510" end="00:21:11.370" style="s2">following your breath in your abdomen</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.010" end="00:21:14.610" style="s2">well the reason why I recommend this and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.370" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">you both pick one and stick with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.610" end="00:21:21.000" style="s2">though is that by focusing on the breath</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:22.620" style="s2">and in the abdomen it tends to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.000" end="00:21:24.420" style="s2">breathing closer to your center of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.620" end="00:21:27.150" style="s2">gravity and it adds to your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.420" end="00:21:30.750" style="s2">stability and groundedness this tends to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.150" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">keep our focus more up in the head area</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.750" end="00:21:35.580" style="s2">and this is a little bit more heady a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:38.670" style="s2">little bit more eccentric this is more</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.580" end="00:21:41.670" style="s2">you know earth centric grounding and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.670" end="00:21:43.260" style="s2">it&#39;s actually closer to your center of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.670" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">gravity so I recommend following your</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.260" end="00:21:49.830" style="s2">breath in your don&#39;t am can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:53.610" style="s2">about detailed posture what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.830" end="00:21:55.650" style="s2">pillow is this any easy substitute so</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.610" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">this is called a Asif ooh easy</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.650" end="00:22:03.020" style="s2">substitute are hard but Jason could you</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">disturb their meditation posture so if</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.210" end="00:22:54.390" style="s2">you can put something like like a small</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:57.900" style="s2">box or a small stool and and then put a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.390" end="00:22:59.940" style="s2">pillow over that that might work as as a</p>

<p begin="00:23:20.280" end="00:23:25.590" style="s2">in one so there&#39;s sort of a set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:27.960" style="s2">influences there&#39;s you know the pasta</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.590" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">activating the pasta it was brought to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.960" end="00:23:34.050" style="s2">North America by Goldstein and cornfield</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:37.670" style="s2">and others Ted in insurance and then I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.050" end="00:23:42.929" style="s2">was taught this in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.670" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">Metta and with Tai Chi Chuan and in a</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:54.030" style="s2">professional training at I practiced for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:56.040" style="s2">about a decade as a shelter therapist so</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.030" end="00:23:59.400" style="s2">all of that is going into it and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.040" end="00:24:02.750" style="s2">also a huge important influence is all</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.400" end="00:24:07.020" style="s2">the work I&#39;ve done on mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.750" end="00:24:11.370" style="s2">Insight flow etc that&#39;s also informing</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.020" end="00:24:14.429" style="s2">how I&#39;m teaching you what do you do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.370" end="00:24:16.470" style="s2">the thought inside question oh I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.429" end="00:24:17.850" style="s2">I should have mentioned that the second</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.470" end="00:24:19.800" style="s2">question about the pillow was from</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.850" end="00:24:22.309" style="s2">harina Destin thank you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.800" end="00:24:25.740" style="s2">the third question was also for from</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.309" end="00:24:28.740" style="s2">crimina and this is from saga 20 what to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.740" end="00:24:30.780" style="s2">do with the thought which is insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.740" end="00:24:33.720" style="s2">question the teacher that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.780" end="00:24:34.650" style="s2">remember better to write it away write</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.720" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">it right away</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.650" end="00:24:37.290" style="s2">or get back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.830" style="s2">breath and let it come back continuously</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.290" end="00:24:42.390" style="s2">I recommend not breaking your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.830" end="00:24:45.180" style="s2">to write it down</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.390" end="00:24:46.920" style="s2">I recommend labeling it as thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.180" end="00:24:49.320" style="s2">returning to your breath and be willing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.920" end="00:24:50.990" style="s2">to let your insight go and have faith</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.320" end="00:24:53.610" style="s2">and trust</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.990" end="00:24:57.540" style="s2">spontaneous aspects of your mind will</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.610" end="00:25:00.810" style="s2">give you your insight or question back</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.540" end="00:25:03.060" style="s2">to you once you come out with time that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.810" end="00:25:05.220" style="s2">will become very very regular for you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.060" end="00:25:07.380" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a on the inside or thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.220" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">in the meditation you&#39;ll let it go</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.380" end="00:25:10.350" style="s2">completely you&#39;ll be able to return to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:12.060" style="s2">the breath you&#39;ll think it&#39;s for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.350" end="00:25:13.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll come back you&#39;ll say oh I had</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.060" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">some sort of insight and then it comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.560" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">back this especially you can train</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:22.530" style="s2">yourself to say if you put a book near</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:25.350" style="s2">you and say during the meditation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.530" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">not going to try to hold onto my</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.350" end="00:25:29.040" style="s2">insights but as soon as I come out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:32.130" style="s2">the meditation I will try to remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.040" end="00:25:37.650" style="s2">this and so I recommend that as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.130" end="00:25:40.650" style="s2">strategy who&#39;s behind me this way Jason</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.650" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">is behind me that way on my son and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.650" end="00:25:49.500" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing no one behind me right</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:53.100" style="s2">now is it okay to recenter the body</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.500" end="00:25:55.800" style="s2">during a meditation set if I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.100" end="00:25:58.830" style="s2">I&#39;m slouching over yes it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.800" end="00:26:02.490" style="s2">to slightly readjust do those micro</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.830" end="00:26:05.430" style="s2">adjustments to recover your Center that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:07.740" style="s2">is completely fine to do I find it</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.430" end="00:26:11.190" style="s2">difficult to constantly do that was from</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.740" end="00:26:12.690" style="s2">Lars Karl max wraps oh ho I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.190" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">better remember to mention your names</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.690" end="00:26:19.110" style="s2">please forgive me asked who&#39;s behind me</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:20.850" style="s2">anastasiya terekhova is asking I find it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.110" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">difficult to constantly do baby breath</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.850" end="00:26:24.450" style="s2">and find myself having to take a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:26.040" style="s2">deep breath through my chest is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.450" end="00:26:28.920" style="s2">just from being unaccustomed to belly</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.040" end="00:26:31.620" style="s2">breathing yes it is and I recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.920" end="00:26:33.810" style="s2">if don&#39;t force the baby breathing at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.620" end="00:26:37.080" style="s2">I just let it go if you&#39;re breathing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.810" end="00:26:38.910" style="s2">up here then follow it there try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.080" end="00:26:41.550" style="s2">your chest open and your shoulders down</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.910" end="00:26:43.530" style="s2">follow your breathing here and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.550" end="00:26:45.930" style="s2">know see if you can very gently coax it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.530" end="00:26:48.780" style="s2">a little bit little tiny bit each time</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.930" end="00:26:49.350" style="s2">but not force it especially don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.780" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">into the hop</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.350" end="00:26:53.340" style="s2">taking lots of deep breaths or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:55.410" style="s2">going to hyperventilate so the baby</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:58.650" style="s2">breathing for some people because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.410" end="00:27:01.770" style="s2">got lots of just breathing it takes time</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.650" end="00:27:03.809" style="s2">and so the baby breathing is a goal you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.770" end="00:27:06.660" style="s2">are gradually very very gradually</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.809" end="00:27:08.940" style="s2">working your way towards okay follow</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.660" end="00:27:11.850" style="s2">your breath where it naturally is even</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.940" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">if it&#39;s very high and then keep it in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.850" end="00:27:17.130" style="s2">mind that you&#39;re going to try and open</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:21.390" style="s2">up and let it sort of melt and dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.130" end="00:27:22.860" style="s2">and drain down and over time it&#39;ll drop</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.390" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">into your belly you&#39;ll be able to do</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.490" end="00:27:45.240" style="s2">I tend if I&#39;m exhaling here that tends</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.490" end="00:27:48.390" style="s2">to sort of choke it off from the excel</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.240" end="00:27:52.200" style="s2">so here and then exhale here and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.390" end="00:27:53.850" style="s2">you follow the breath coming up there&#39;s</p>
