<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:04.770" style="s2">guess so I have another one that also</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:06.029" style="s2">come out of the conversation that I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.770" end="00:00:09.030" style="s2">today and I&#39;d like to try to get that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.029" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">one shot as well this speaks to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.030" end="00:00:14.759" style="s2">problematic that has definitely been in</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:16.949" style="s2">the in the air around the work of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.759" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">Peterson and this has to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">question of responsibility and so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">like to give my my take on it you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">that I&#39;ve talked a lot about sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">and about what it looks like and what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">means and how it works and that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">proposal that I would make and and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">think this is also the perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">Peterson has although you know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">talked to him about it in detail so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">don&#39;t really know is there&#39;s a stack</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:47.010" style="s2">there&#39;s like a pathing he says you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">got to get you got to clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.010" end="00:00:51.739" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to get yourself sorted out</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">before you can try to fix your</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.739" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">relationships with your family and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">before you can try to go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">something in the world right and my</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:01.879" style="s2">proposition is that that&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">or less true and I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.879" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">which is not to say by any stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">the imagination that going out and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">addressing things in your community and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:13.430" style="s2">going out and addressing things in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">larger world is not simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.430" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">needful and doable</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">it&#39;s just that they actually have to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:23.540" style="s2">done in the right in the right order and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">here&#39;s why I think that&#39;s the case I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.540" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">think it comes down to this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:33.869" style="s2">how responsibility cashes out and how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">can find ourselves subtly failing to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.869" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">able to take responsibility so the rule</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">that I would put in place the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:43.610" style="s2">proposition that I would make is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">you cannot take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.610" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">someone else until you can actually take</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">full responsibility for yourself now by</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">that I don&#39;t mean that you&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">mastery in self responsibility I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">mean that your sovereignty as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:06.149" style="s2">individual has become infinite what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">mean is at a minimum you have begun the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.149" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">process of actually being aware of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">your own personal sovereignty looks and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:13.270" style="s2">feels like you&#39;ve begun the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:14.380" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.270" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">strucked in your own individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.380" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">sovereignty and you made the choice to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:23.230" style="s2">fully take responsibility for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">what that means is you get hit by a bus</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.230" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">you lose all your money in a stock</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">market downturn you&#39;re you know a dog</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:31.780" style="s2">gets hit by lightning you take</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">responsibility for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.780" end="00:02:35.590" style="s2">now that sounds maybe a little weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:38.650" style="s2">obviously in some sense you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.590" end="00:02:42.550" style="s2">causal agency over lightning in stock</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.650" end="00:02:44.380" style="s2">market phenomena so what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.550" end="00:02:46.870" style="s2">take responsibility for that well at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:48.790" style="s2">minimum it means maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.870" end="00:02:51.190" style="s2">integrity of your sovereignty in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.790" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">response to the things the world throws</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:56.020" style="s2">at you all right you get that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2">key insight once you&#39;ve taken a choice</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.020" end="00:02:59.140" style="s2">made a choice to take full</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.640" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">responsibility for yourself what that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.140" end="00:03:05.050" style="s2">means is not that you can control the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:06.700" style="s2">world what it means is that you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.050" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">to maintain the integrity of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.700" end="00:03:11.800" style="s2">sovereignty no matter what the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:13.060" style="s2">throws at you and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.800" end="00:03:15.910" style="s2">that you&#39;re able to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:18.340" style="s2">capacity to make the least the best</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.910" end="00:03:20.910" style="s2">choices that you can make your showing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.340" end="00:03:24.070" style="s2">up the best that you can show up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.910" end="00:03:26.590" style="s2">response to the circumstances that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.070" end="00:03:29.380" style="s2">find yourself in right this sends if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.590" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">think being the key quite often people</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.380" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">will go in two distinct bad directions</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:39.340" style="s2">one direction is they actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:40.630" style="s2">externalize this responsibility and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.340" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">they really do is they disempower</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.630" end="00:03:47.410" style="s2">themselves so if you blame the world for</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:49.390" style="s2">shitty things that happen to you what</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.410" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">you&#39;re doing actually is disempowering</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.390" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re weakening yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:54.790" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that flat out the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">the world does stuff over which you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.790" end="00:03:59.110" style="s2">no agency that doesn&#39;t matter what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:01.420" style="s2">have agency over is how you respond to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.110" end="00:04:03.130" style="s2">it and whether you respond to it and by</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:05.320" style="s2">externalizing that agency about</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.130" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">externalizing your capacity to choose</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.320" end="00:04:09.610" style="s2">how you respond which you fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:13.300" style="s2">do own all the way down to existential</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.610" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">base by outsourcing the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.300" end="00:04:18.430" style="s2">choose how you respond then you are no</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">longer able to maintain the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.430" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">your own sovereignty which means by</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">definition you&#39;re now no longer able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">actually make good choices okay well</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">well now if you&#39;re in a circumstance we</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">were trying to do something awfully</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:33.620" style="s2">difficult like enter into relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:35.390" style="s2">with other human beings or modify the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.620" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">conditions of the complex environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.390" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">which you live and you&#39;re not making as</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:41.510" style="s2">good a choice as you can make well</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a meta bad choice right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.510" end="00:04:47.720" style="s2">you&#39;re setting yourself and the world up</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:49.460" style="s2">for bad consequences and so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.720" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">piece then the second piece is even more</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.460" end="00:04:53.510" style="s2">problematic you might have like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">almost an involution of the first which</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.510" end="00:05:00.590" style="s2">is not only do you externalize your own</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">agency right you blame the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.590" end="00:05:06.830" style="s2">again I need to reinforce I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:08.360" style="s2">not being aware of the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.830" end="00:05:10.250" style="s2"> going on over which you have no</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.360" end="00:05:12.260" style="s2">control that&#39;s very different what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.250" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">mean is blaming the world externalizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.260" end="00:05:20.270" style="s2">your own authority over your own choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:21.290" style="s2">making right that&#39;s the key all right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.270" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">that&#39;s probably number one problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.290" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">number two is when you go beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">and you actually begin constructing</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:35.390" style="s2">something that can only satisfy itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:37.880" style="s2">by operating in that externalized</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.390" end="00:05:42.250" style="s2">environment that&#39;s tricky let me see if</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.880" end="00:05:45.260" style="s2">I can get make that more clear so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.250" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a mania that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.260" end="00:05:50.930" style="s2">begin that second path a mania for</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:54.260" style="s2">actually identifying agency as external</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.930" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">and therefore only being able to feel a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.260" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2">sense of being agenting by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2">exercise and control over that which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.300" end="00:06:04.310" style="s2">external how&#39;s that for a mouthful that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.150" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">I think is the key insight all right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.310" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">the idea is that in the first move you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:10.700" style="s2">disempower yourself by externalizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:13.100" style="s2">your agency and the second move you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.700" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">actually identify the outside as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.100" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">essence of the agency and your ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:18.530" style="s2">to control and influence that as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">only mechanism of agency that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.530" end="00:06:22.370" style="s2">available to you or of course is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.870" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">radical disempowerment and very</p>
