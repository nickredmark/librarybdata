<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:07.259" style="s2">so there is an issue people are very</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.190" end="00:00:11.570" style="s2">sensitive about arrogance and the term</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.259" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">has a justly negative connotation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.570" end="00:00:19.490" style="s2">the term humility has or humbleness it</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">has a very positive connotation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.490" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">while I was teaching I always was</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">concerned that the negative reputation</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">of arrogance and the positive reputation</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">of humbleness was a danger to my</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">students and at the same time I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:38.790" style="s2">want to argue to them that being</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">arrogant was a good thing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.790" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">not we do we just lead dislike arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">people but if you have to air in one</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">direction or the other it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.780" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">air in the direction of arrogance and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">the reason is this we all have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">capacity to do things if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">things that we might be capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">and we say well probably I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">accomplish that one if we take the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">humble approach then we will shoot low</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">and we will never discover what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">actually truly capable of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">if you overestimate what you might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">capable of well then you are in danger</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">of not reaching what you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">were going to accomplish but you will at</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">least discover the limits of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">capacity so if you have to err in one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">these directions you want to err in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">direction of overestimating what you may</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">be capable of rather than under</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">estimating it just simply so that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">discover what you can do and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">wondered if the value this social value</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">that we put on being humble was actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">a mechanism to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">self-sabotage in other words I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">really you know I don&#39;t want students to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">be humble what I want them to be is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">accurate in assessing what they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">accomplished and what it means and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">setting their goals I want them to set</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:15.670" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:17.020" style="s2">hi and then maybe they surprised</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:18.310" style="s2">themselves and they exceed them but if</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.020" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">they really set the goals high maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:21.970" style="s2">they don&#39;t quite achieve what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:23.349" style="s2">set out to achieve but at least they</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.970" end="00:02:24.459" style="s2">discover what they&#39;re capable of it may</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.349" end="00:02:27.160" style="s2">be they discover what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.459" end="00:02:30.010" style="s2">interested in whereas if everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.160" end="00:02:32.650" style="s2">the room is busy being humble and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.010" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">advertising that you know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.650" end="00:02:38.650" style="s2">not arrogant then we have really no idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">what those individuals could do or what</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.650" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">the room is capable of so essentially I</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:51.970" style="s2">think people should stop penalizing what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:57.370" style="s2">sounds to them like arrogance because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.970" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">is a sort of generic stigma that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.370" end="00:03:02.860" style="s2">accompanies people who believe in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:04.840" style="s2">themselves that causes us not to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.860" end="00:03:06.700" style="s2">our way out of various bottlenecks in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.840" end="00:03:08.590" style="s2">other words we need people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.700" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">contemplate the possibility that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.590" end="00:03:13.660" style="s2">are capable of things that if they say</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">it out loud many will regard them as</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.660" end="00:03:17.709" style="s2">Eric but we need people to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">these things and to figure out whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.709" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">they are in fact capable of doing them</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:28.299" style="s2">in order for us to escape our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">set of predicaments so I don&#39;t know give</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.299" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">people a break as they assess what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:36.519" style="s2">might be capable of and for God&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">when you&#39;re raising kids or teaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.519" end="00:03:44.109" style="s2">students don&#39;t teach them to be humble</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:47.170" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want them to be nasty</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.109" end="00:03:48.519" style="s2">but teaching them to imagine that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.170" end="00:03:51.790" style="s2">are capable of less than they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.519" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">actually capable of is educational</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.790" end="00:03:58.359" style="s2">malpractice I&#39;ve run it - in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:01.420" style="s2">creative world I&#39;ve run into people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.359" end="00:04:04.630" style="s2">often mistaking ambitiousness with</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">pretentiousness mm-hmm and it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.630" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">and in the art world because you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">be a little pretentious and pretentious</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:13.640" style="s2">more has to do with what you see</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:16.130" style="s2">to be rather than what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.640" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">be and so there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.130" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">optics</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.630" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s it&#39;s good to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">energy humility you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.630" end="00:04:23.780" style="s2">positives to that that&#39;s good to have I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know if arrogance is the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.780" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">term I would use more ambition or or</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:31.490" style="s2">like you said like hanging high well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">not defending areas I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.490" end="00:04:37.699" style="s2">arrogant people any more than the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:39.979" style="s2">person but I often think that those who</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.699" end="00:04:42.259" style="s2">are dismissed as arrogant aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.979" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">arrogant what they are is ambitious in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.259" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">some and you know there&#39;s kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">ambition that I really don&#39;t especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:51.590" style="s2">like but somebody who is ambitious in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:53.870" style="s2">the sense of trying to discover what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.590" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">might be possible I don&#39;t want to get in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.870" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">that person&#39;s way and I also don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">to imagine that I understand more about</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">their process of discovering something</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:06.979" style="s2">new than that I understand I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">my process to an extent but I&#39;m inclined</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.979" end="00:05:12.680" style="s2">to give somebody who might have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.860" end="00:05:16.699" style="s2">extraordinary capacity room to go about</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">doing what they do in some way that may</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.699" end="00:05:21.889" style="s2">not make sense to me because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:23.449" style="s2">interested in seeing what they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.889" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">accomplish we&#39;re all enhanced if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.449" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">accomplish something good and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:32.150" style="s2">the the irony here is that once somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.090" end="00:05:35.510" style="s2">has succeeded in demonstrating that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.150" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">have high capacity in some sense when</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.510" end="00:05:40.580" style="s2">somebody has generated the object that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:43.760" style="s2">nobody else could build then we elevate</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.580" end="00:05:45.380" style="s2">their story so it doesn&#39;t make sense for</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.760" end="00:05:46.849" style="s2">that us to give them a hard time as</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:48.020" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to accomplish the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.849" end="00:05:49.880" style="s2">and then as soon as they&#39;ve demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.020" end="00:05:52.310" style="s2">that we were wrong and they were right</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.880" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">about their ability to do it then to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:05:57.409" style="s2">turn them into heroes at some level we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2">ought to give them room on the front end</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.409" end="00:06:01.789" style="s2">and give them a break because frankly</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:05.150" style="s2">almost all of the people whose stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.789" end="00:06:07.490" style="s2">we circulate with respect to having</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.150" end="00:06:09.590" style="s2">changed the way things function in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.490" end="00:06:13.190" style="s2">positive direction almost all of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.590" end="00:06:17.110" style="s2">people are weird and many of them broken</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.190" end="00:06:19.219" style="s2">in some way that actually gave them some</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:22.430" style="s2">particular capacity that&#39;s above and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.219" end="00:06:25.910" style="s2">beyond what the rest of us do so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.430" end="00:06:29.480" style="s2">I really I must say I have a a pet peeve</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.910" end="00:06:34.010" style="s2">about a system that just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.480" end="00:06:36.170" style="s2">generically encourages people to say out</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.010" end="00:06:41.060" style="s2">loud that they don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.170" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">themselves above some relatively common</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">level that&#39;s just that&#39;s a mistake I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">want to know what you think you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:49.190" style="s2">you know I want to know your wildest</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">idea and what your plan is for figuring</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.190" end="00:06:52.760" style="s2">out if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:54.830" style="s2">and if you&#39;re constantly reviewing</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.760" end="00:06:58.610" style="s2">whether or not it would sound arrogant</p>

<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:03.980" style="s2">I mean I love the Wright brothers story</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.060" end="00:09:07.130" style="s2">because hey we know so much about what</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.980" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">they did and B you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.130" end="00:09:14.270" style="s2">interesting that they were brothers and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:17.180" style="s2">you know we we have a lot of documentary</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.270" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">evidence of how they overcame all of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.180" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">obstacles along the way but at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:25.160" style="s2">level they got very comfortable with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:28.430" style="s2">idea that they were gonna beat a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.160" end="00:09:34.810" style="s2">that had stymied so many other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.430" end="00:09:37.940" style="s2">and we rightly Harold them for it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.810" end="00:09:39.650" style="s2">you can imagine contemporaries if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.940" end="00:09:42.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t know whether the Wright brothers</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.650" end="00:09:45.410" style="s2">were going to succeed or fail you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.680" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">imagine that they were just arrogant</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">they were going to take to the skies</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.650" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">like birds you know and that that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">that was hubris and it&#39;s not is there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">there some benefit to having that social</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">resistance as somebody who&#39;s creative or</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">s but again created in the broadest</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">possibilities is there some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.470" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">positive to be gotten from the ridicule</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:13.430" style="s2">that one receives or with us being</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">considered a kook or arrogant or</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.430" end="00:10:16.970" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:19.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.970" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">a couple things going on there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.370" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">circumstances maybe within a tight-knit</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:27.230" style="s2">group of people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">accomplish something together some</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.230" end="00:10:32.840" style="s2">individual might try to gain more</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:34.940" style="s2">control over the project than was</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.840" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">warranted by their relative capacities</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.940" end="00:10:38.810" style="s2">or something like that in which case</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:40.850" style="s2">their arrogance would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.810" end="00:10:44.090" style="s2">counterproductive and so it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.850" end="00:10:46.990" style="s2">best where the penalty was generated was</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.090" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">that there are certain contexts in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.990" end="00:10:51.530" style="s2">it is not a question of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:54.110" style="s2">assessing their own capacity it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.150" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">yourself are capable of it could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.740" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">you&#39;re claiming capacity that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:17.000" style="s2">really have when somebody else might</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:19.520" style="s2">have that capacity and they will be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.000" end="00:11:22.790" style="s2">denied the resources because because of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.520" end="00:11:24.170" style="s2">your your arrogance and so it might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.790" end="00:11:32.540" style="s2">that and it also might be that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.170" end="00:11:35.900" style="s2">creates a kind of it might fuel certain</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.960" end="00:11:54.290" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly well in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.840" end="00:11:56.630" style="s2">people who have done things that make</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.290" end="00:11:58.640" style="s2">their names famous eventually are often</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.660" end="00:12:17.000" style="s2">humility becomes a negative and</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.140" end="00:12:29.190" style="s2">is working together like that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.180" end="00:12:31.710" style="s2">the the value kind of shifts easing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.190" end="00:12:34.500" style="s2">probably I mean I again I should be</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.500" end="00:12:41.430" style="s2">I really don&#39;t like arrogant people but</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.410" end="00:12:46.410" style="s2">I will imagine that arrogance is what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.430" end="00:13:58.620" style="s2">around punishing the whole set because</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.500" end="00:14:00.210" style="s2">99% of what&#39;s in it is garbage if a</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.960" end="00:14:16.530" style="s2">be outrageous and conception but be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.830" end="00:14:19.200" style="s2">willing to admit that most of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.530" end="00:14:20.440" style="s2">outrageousness is completely outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.200" end="00:14:26.190" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.440" end="00:14:29.649" style="s2">well I in interacting with really</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.190" end="00:14:31.889" style="s2">interesting ultra high capacity people I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.649" end="00:14:37.180" style="s2">do think it would it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.889" end="00:14:40.709" style="s2">to a person I believe they have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.180" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">phrasing things that allows you to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.709" end="00:14:47.560" style="s2">that they spot the unlikeliness of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:54.100" style="s2">they are claiming might be true at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.560" end="00:14:57.490" style="s2">same time that they let you know why</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.100" end="00:15:00.879" style="s2">they think the limit might not really be</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.490" end="00:15:05.319" style="s2">the limit in other words they evidence</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.879" end="00:15:07.569" style="s2">that they are not unaware of why they</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.319" end="00:15:09.490" style="s2">are unlikely to succeed they evidence</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.569" end="00:15:11.889" style="s2">that they are aware of it and they still</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.490" end="00:15:15.639" style="s2">think they might succeed for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.889" end="00:15:17.410" style="s2">that they can spell out to one degree or</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.639" end="00:15:21.550" style="s2">another and so I guess what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.410" end="00:15:24.370" style="s2">is if I see the evidence that the person</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">is aware of all of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.370" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">aware of that make me think they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">unlikely to succeed and yet they still</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:32.350" style="s2">think they might I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:35.110" style="s2">right if they evidence that they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.350" end="00:15:37.449" style="s2">unaware of the difficulty you know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.110" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way if somebody has an</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.449" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">idea for a perpetual motion machine and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.740" end="00:15:46.660" style="s2">they do not start their argument by</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:48.430" style="s2">explaining that they understand the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.660" end="00:15:52.389" style="s2">physical reason that a perpetual motion</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.430" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">machine should not exist then that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.389" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">suggests that just a cook on the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:59.410" style="s2">hand if they say well there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:02.529" style="s2">free energy in the universe and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">believe I have found a mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.529" end="00:16:06.670" style="s2">can capture it in a way that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:08.259" style="s2">exactly perpetual motion yet it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.670" end="00:16:10.389" style="s2">functions an awful lot like it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.259" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">well that claim is really unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.389" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">true on the other hand they&#39;ve just told</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:17.439" style="s2">me that they understand the obstacle and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:21.050" style="s2">they are still thinking about it for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.439" end="00:16:22.970" style="s2">reason so there&#39;s evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.050" end="00:16:25.160" style="s2">see that comes packaged with the claim</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.970" end="00:16:27.950" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a question of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.160" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">their desire to shoot for the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.950" end="00:16:35.810" style="s2">is motivated by naivete about why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:38.390" style="s2">impossible or by thinking that they see</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.810" end="00:16:42.200" style="s2">a gap in the completeness of our model</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.390" end="00:16:47.150" style="s2">and in fact you know Tesla is a great</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.200" end="00:16:50.090" style="s2">example Tesla who was extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.150" end="00:16:54.400" style="s2">successful at bringing things many</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.090" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">thought impossible to fruition and yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.400" end="00:16:59.410" style="s2">kind of hopeless and defending his own</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:01.790" style="s2">cause you know he and Edison are a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.410" end="00:17:04.300" style="s2">wonderful comparison because Edison was</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.790" end="00:17:09.430" style="s2">a brilliant businessman and ruthless and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.300" end="00:17:11.780" style="s2">died very very rich and Tesla was</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.430" end="00:17:16.370" style="s2">properly substantially more brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.780" end="00:17:18.470" style="s2">but died penniless because he just he</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.370" end="00:17:20.180" style="s2">cared less about that aspect of it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.470" end="00:17:22.430" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t good at defending his own</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.180" end="00:17:23.900" style="s2">interests and so you know his wealth</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.430" end="00:17:27.670" style="s2">that he generated ended up in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.900" end="00:17:30.850" style="s2">Westinghouse&#39;s pocket not his own but</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.670" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">but there&#39;s something to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.850" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">somebody should probably catalog and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:36.170" style="s2">probably they have already and I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.700" end="00:17:38.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly where to look for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.170" end="00:17:42.380" style="s2">but there&#39;s gotta be a catalogue of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.440" end="00:17:45.080" style="s2">things people said were impossible that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.380" end="00:17:46.400" style="s2">have now been accomplished and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.080" end="00:17:48.260" style="s2">they&#39;re all beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">anytime somebody accomplishes things</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.260" end="00:17:52.940" style="s2">that others were sure couldn&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:56.030" style="s2">the story of how they got there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.940" end="00:17:57.590" style="s2">inevitably interesting and so anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.030" end="00:18:00.020" style="s2">last thing I want to do is shout down</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.590" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">the tiny number of people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.020" end="00:18:04.910" style="s2">might be able to jump one of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">impossible gaps from the basis that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.910" end="00:18:08.980" style="s2">know on the basis that everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:08.980" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.700" end="00:18:18.370" style="s2">so arrogance yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.670" end="00:18:20.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not arrogance is the pathological</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.370" end="00:18:23.860" style="s2">version but if you go around telling</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.679" end="00:18:25.270" style="s2">people arrogance is bad what is arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s overestimating what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.270" end="00:18:30.790" style="s2">capable of and then the person tries to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:32.740" style="s2">wield that definition they don&#39;t wield</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.790" end="00:18:34.330" style="s2">it recognizing they&#39;re not in a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.740" end="00:18:36.910" style="s2">position to assess what other people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.330" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">necessarily capable of and so arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.910" end="00:18:41.559" style="s2">itself that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.190" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">it is a a form of generic arrogance that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.559" end="00:18:48.250" style="s2">we empower people with to go shout down</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:49.990" style="s2">others who have some kind of ambition to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.250" end="00:18:56.140" style="s2">break some limit that nobody&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.990" end="00:18:59.799" style="s2">yet it&#39;s odd how judgments when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.140" end="00:19:02.230" style="s2">wielded they blind the wielder to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.799" end="00:19:03.850" style="s2">exact judgment that they end up in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.230" end="00:19:06.429" style="s2">blind spot the judgment that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.429" end="00:19:13.570" style="s2">raises an important point so there&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.140" end="00:19:15.580" style="s2">technique that comes out of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.570" end="00:19:17.530" style="s2">rationalist community called steel</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.580" end="00:19:19.780" style="s2">Manning and steel Manning is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.530" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">opposite of straw hat straw Manning is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.780" end="00:19:23.650" style="s2">painting your opponent&#39;s position as</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:26.830" style="s2">weaker than it is so that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.650" end="00:19:28.540" style="s2">defeat it steel Manning is painting your</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.830" end="00:19:35.559" style="s2">opponent&#39;s position as strongly as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.540" end="00:19:39.210" style="s2">can in order to make sure that you are</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.210" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">people who are really careful thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.490" end="00:19:48.580" style="s2">are frequently excellent and may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">always excellent at understanding the</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">was presented before you show why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.220" end="00:20:13.030" style="s2">wrong is very powerful it&#39;s not easy but</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:15.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very powerful and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.030" end="00:20:17.910" style="s2">that we should be teaching right</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.480" end="00:20:21.950" style="s2">understand what your opponent is saying</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.950" end="00:20:26.730" style="s2">it&#39;s really the heart of a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">analytical education and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.730" end="00:20:32.520" style="s2">what makes the judgment I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:35.250" style="s2">three sigma you&#39;re not just using the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.520" end="00:20:38.610" style="s2">judgment to gain power or to be right</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.250" end="00:20:40.260" style="s2">but to assure that everybody is right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.610" end="00:20:42.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably what&#39;s persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.260" end="00:20:44.310" style="s2">about it&#39;s kind of you&#39;ve done so much</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.840" end="00:20:45.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve sunk so much work into</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.830" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">as possible well it it goes to this I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.440" style="s2">still don&#39;t know quite what to make of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.270" style="s2">it but when I was confronted by the</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.810" end="00:21:19.310" style="s2">said something in that hallway history</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.310" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">well I said something that I remember</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.350" end="00:21:32.850" style="s2">odd that you would say that here it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.350" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">yeah dialectic being the process of</p>
