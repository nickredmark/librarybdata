<p begin="00:00:03.589" end="00:00:10.980" style="s2">been writing a lot recently about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">mental disease of late stage capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.980" end="00:00:15.750" style="s2">how to deal with the crises that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">just coming one after another in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.750" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">world today the feelings of loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">and isolation that arise around</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">individualistic cultures and economic</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:32.910" style="s2">and the effects that they have on us and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">what I want to do now is just be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.910" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">little bit more personal and share with</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">you some of my experiences as I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">writing these things and the responses</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been getting so first off in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">case you&#39;re wondering if you read some</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">of my work recently I&#39;m actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">happy and upbeat person and so I I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">kind of person who I like taking off my</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">friends and be suit be silly and goofy</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">and I&#39;m a dancer and I like to move even</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">tall like the way I&#39;m recording this</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">video I&#39;m like I don&#39;t sit still very</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">well you know I I like to be up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:10.790" style="s2">moving and so what does it mean for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">someone who&#39;s upbeat and energetic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.790" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">exciting about the world to step back</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:23.240" style="s2">and do with the immense trauma that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:26.750" style="s2">of us are going through right now and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.240" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">feel into that and so here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.750" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">first of all we live in a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">designed around the outcomes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">getting so there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">empowering and saying the economy is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">broken it&#39;s fixed it has been built</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">brick by brick policy by policy to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">wealth from the productive activities of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">everyday people and accumulate it in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">hands of yardie bitch this is not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">some big mistake it&#39;s not that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">are too stupid to figure out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">it right it&#39;s that there were some</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">people who were smart enough to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">out how to make this system work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">themselves and that&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:11.290" style="s2">inspiring in spite of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">conspiratorial feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.290" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">because what it says is that if a group</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:22.420" style="s2">of people over time can build up their</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:24.099" style="s2">policy frameworks in a way that create</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:27.849" style="s2">wealth and security in the consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.099" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">of power then that means that the much</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.849" end="00:02:33.370" style="s2">larger community of the rest of us who</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:35.980" style="s2">collectively hold much much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.370" end="00:02:37.390" style="s2">knowledge and expertise than the small</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.980" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">group of people ever could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.390" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:42.940" style="s2">having that if we just coordinate our</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:46.420" style="s2">actions in the right way we just find</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.940" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">the right ways to cooperate we will be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.420" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">smarter faster more agile more creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:54.579" style="s2">than these people who have been rigging</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:57.459" style="s2">our systems see that the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.579" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">about like the surveillance state what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.459" end="00:03:03.970" style="s2">Edward Snowden showed us and how there</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:06.579" style="s2">the need to surveil people and imprison</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.970" end="00:03:09.220" style="s2">people to stop them from speaking truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.579" end="00:03:11.620" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on and to have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.220" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">information become privatized so that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.620" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">small set of people can benefit from it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:18.459" style="s2">well no one else does well what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:21.250" style="s2">says is that the people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.459" end="00:03:23.980" style="s2">gaming the system have been gaming it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.250" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">not by being innovative they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.980" end="00:03:28.569" style="s2">doing it by siphoning off the value of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">innovation closing it off where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.569" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">find it so if we have ways to open it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.299" end="00:03:35.410" style="s2">to make it more inclusive to let more</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:39.459" style="s2">people participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.410" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">to have actual open markets rather than</p>

<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:47.109" style="s2">oligarchies were basically the people</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.109" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">rigged it to benefit themselves and the</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:47.950" style="s2">if we look back in our history in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:50.140" style="s2">scientists who study human evolution can</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.950" end="00:04:52.810" style="s2">tell you this with you know countless</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.140" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">books and stories there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.810" end="00:04:59.950" style="s2">research on this now human beings were</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:05:02.770" style="s2">profoundly social deeply incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.950" end="00:05:05.200" style="s2">social we depend on each other we live</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.770" end="00:05:07.960" style="s2">in groups were born vulnerable and need</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.960" end="00:05:11.410" style="s2">almost nothing about how to get in wrap</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.400" end="00:05:22.150" style="s2">are we are a kind of animal that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:24.760" style="s2">throughout its long history has figured</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.340" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">at and we thrive that and you see it</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.500" end="00:05:35.230" style="s2">every time there&#39;s an earthquake or a</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.940" end="00:05:51.100" style="s2">inspiring the reason that we don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:53.200" style="s2">is because there all of these systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:55.390" style="s2">that have been built up to divide us to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.200" end="00:05:57.790" style="s2">pit us against each other to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.390" end="00:06:00.640" style="s2">that someone over there is the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.790" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">when the real enemy is the systems of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.640" end="00:06:08.290" style="s2">division themselves so you see the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">that I have studied the problems of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.290" end="00:06:13.390" style="s2">world the more I&#39;ve seen that the only</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:16.450" style="s2">way to understand the problems is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.390" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">explore and enrich your knowledge of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.450" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">much isn&#39;t known about the problems in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:25.290" style="s2">in that exploration in that learning we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:29.550" style="s2">come across a treasure trove of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.290" end="00:06:33.250" style="s2">solutions and so our ability to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.250" end="00:06:38.999" style="s2">crisis is really deep and it&#39;s built on</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.999" end="00:06:44.049" style="s2">so yeah the world&#39;s pretty fucked up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.099" end="00:06:47.259" style="s2">right now there are a lot of shitty</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.049" end="00:06:51.119" style="s2">things going on and it&#39;s hurting all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.259" end="00:06:54.249" style="s2">us we are all feeling the pain of it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.119" end="00:06:56.019" style="s2">yet at the same time if only we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.249" end="00:06:58.299" style="s2">figure out how to trust each other and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.019" end="00:07:01.179" style="s2">cooperate with the people who play well</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.299" end="00:07:03.909" style="s2">together form effective teams and come</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.179" end="00:07:06.069" style="s2">together all the knowledge is there all</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.069" end="00:07:11.259" style="s2">to us we can pick them up and we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.199" end="00:07:15.099" style="s2">learn to use them and we can tackle</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.259" end="00:07:16.989" style="s2">these challenges and actually we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.099" end="00:07:18.969" style="s2">the ability to make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.989" end="00:07:22.899" style="s2">place than it&#39;s probably ever been</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.969" end="00:07:24.999" style="s2">before but we have to recognize that at</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.899" end="00:07:27.909" style="s2">the core of it all there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.999" end="00:07:31.409" style="s2">thing as the isolated individual no man</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.909" end="00:07:34.779" style="s2">woman or child is an island we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.409" end="00:07:36.939" style="s2">deeply social animals we live in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.779" end="00:07:38.889" style="s2">communities we grow in communities we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.939" end="00:07:42.279" style="s2">even become an art become ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.889" end="00:07:45.159" style="s2">relationship to others but more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.279" end="00:07:48.099" style="s2">we&#39;re also part of this world we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.159" end="00:07:49.509" style="s2">part of nature so all that we find</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.099" end="00:07:52.239" style="s2">beautiful in the world that we feel is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.509" end="00:07:57.189" style="s2">threatened by human activities that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.239" end="00:08:01.929" style="s2">part of us we are part of it when I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.189" end="00:08:03.909" style="s2">a beautiful sunset and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.929" end="00:08:05.349" style="s2">beauty of the scene it&#39;s so gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.909" end="00:08:07.209" style="s2">nature is incredible</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.349" end="00:08:10.029" style="s2">well that beauty in that aw is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.209" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">experienced in the brain in the body of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.029" end="00:08:15.279" style="s2">this human organism that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.389" end="00:08:17.529" style="s2">experience reverence and awe is</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.279" end="00:08:20.049" style="s2">something that human beings are capable</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.529" end="00:08:24.729" style="s2">of doing and maybe only a few other</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.049" end="00:08:29.079" style="s2">animals on earth so we are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.729" end="00:08:32.589" style="s2">embodiment we are nature as it is able</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.079" end="00:08:35.679" style="s2">to experience beauty and all so if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.589" end="00:08:37.959" style="s2">lose humans we just might lose that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.679" end="00:08:40.269" style="s2">ability and the universe might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.959" end="00:08:42.129" style="s2">deprived because of it so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.269" end="00:08:44.259" style="s2">humans are the problem and nature will</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.129" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">go on without us so we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.259" end="00:08:50.680" style="s2">nature and our big delusion has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:54.010" style="s2">to not see the whore candidate do not</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.680" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">recognize it in a simple test to see how</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.010" end="00:08:57.910" style="s2">much you&#39;re part of nature is hold your</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">breath and see how long you can go</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:03.910" style="s2">without here how long you can get by</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">without food or water how long you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.910" end="00:09:09.070" style="s2">get by without the knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">someone else created that you use to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.070" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">solve a problem in your daily life you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:18.280" style="s2">see we are all interdependent we are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:23.080" style="s2">part of this wonderful incredible dance</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.280" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">that is the universe and so as I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.110" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">problems are easy to solve we have some</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:42.190" style="s2">but the first thing we have to do before</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:44.950" style="s2">we can ever hope to solve them is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.190" end="00:09:48.070" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s possible to solve them</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.950" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">and to see the innate goodness in the</p>
