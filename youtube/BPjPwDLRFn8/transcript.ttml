<p begin="00:00:11.019" end="00:00:16.299" style="s2">and that people are using them to mend</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.110" end="00:00:19.180" style="s2">trauma they are using them to access</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.299" end="00:00:21.400" style="s2">information and inspiration and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.180" end="00:00:23.890" style="s2">using them to connect and collaborate in</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.400" end="00:00:26.680" style="s2">ways that haven&#39;t necessarily been</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.890" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">possible at this scale before that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.680" end="00:00:31.750" style="s2">good news and that&#39;s creating a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:33.610" style="s2">positive things both in personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.750" end="00:00:35.080" style="s2">and development adjuncts to different</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.880" end="00:00:43.270" style="s2">or as a society so we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.800" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">like micro dosing we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.270" end="00:00:47.350" style="s2">all sorts of different experiment you</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:49.030" style="s2">could really I mean and certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.350" end="00:00:51.220" style="s2">premise that Stephen Connor and I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.030" end="00:00:53.020" style="s2">about in stealing fire is that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.220" end="00:00:55.060" style="s2">neuro chemistry we have access to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.020" end="00:00:56.440" style="s2">know that&#39;s our toolkit and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.060" end="00:00:58.030" style="s2">to it through a bunch of different means</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.440" end="00:00:59.560" style="s2">you can use smart tech you can use</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.030" end="00:01:01.270" style="s2">meditation you can use breathing</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.560" end="00:01:03.490" style="s2">techniques and use sexuality you can use</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.270" end="00:01:05.740" style="s2">pharmacology you can use dance and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.490" end="00:01:07.120" style="s2">movement and music really that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.740" end="00:01:08.860" style="s2">the interest the most interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.120" end="00:01:10.990" style="s2">of all it&#39;s not what&#39;s the flavor of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.860" end="00:01:12.700" style="s2">week and what does a new study tell us</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.990" end="00:01:15.640" style="s2">it&#39;s that we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.700" end="00:01:17.560" style="s2">neurophysiology of human optimization</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.640" end="00:01:19.810" style="s2">and transcendence now now the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.560" end="00:01:22.050" style="s2">interesting thing is no sooner do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.810" end="00:01:25.390" style="s2">have that experience of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.050" end="00:01:27.640" style="s2">prompt ecstatic or moments where we step</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.390" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">beyond ourselves and you could call flow</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.640" end="00:01:31.630" style="s2">States there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:34.480" style="s2">different Peake states that would fall</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.630" end="00:01:36.940" style="s2">under that big tent and you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.480" end="00:01:38.740" style="s2">you know people bonding very closely</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.940" end="00:01:41.020" style="s2">with the folks they share those</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.740" end="00:01:42.909" style="s2">experiences with what Victor Turner the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.020" end="00:01:45.010" style="s2">anthropologist would recall communitas</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.909" end="00:01:48.850" style="s2">so the moment you have ecstatically</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.010" end="00:01:52.510" style="s2">inspired community then you have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.850" end="00:01:55.540" style="s2">of just tackle head-on the question and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.510" end="00:01:57.190" style="s2">the liability of the cult because a cult</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.540" end="00:01:58.570" style="s2">and you know most of us when we think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.190" end="00:02:00.430" style="s2">that we think of it in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.570" end="00:02:03.010" style="s2">scandalous terms we think of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.430" end="00:02:05.320" style="s2">helter skelter Manson family or the Jim</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.010" end="00:02:07.030" style="s2">Jones drink the kool-aid side but from</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.320" end="00:02:09.399" style="s2">you know religious studies or</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.030" end="00:02:11.470" style="s2">anthropology a cult is literally just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.399" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">community of practice bonded together</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.470" end="00:02:15.610" style="s2">around some</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:17.950" style="s2">Eppie fanuc you know or revelatory</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">experience basically it&#39;s any religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:22.060" style="s2">group that doesn&#39;t yet that is not yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">state sanctioned is a cult so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.060" end="00:02:25.300" style="s2">question is is we know there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:27.310" style="s2">dysfunctional ones we know there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.300" end="00:02:32.050" style="s2">lots and lots of unethical cults</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.310" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">particularly where leaders hijack money</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.050" end="00:02:37.600" style="s2">power sexuality and control and even</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:40.090" style="s2">pick pick any two and you&#39;re done you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.600" end="00:02:42.100" style="s2">know so the question is is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.090" end="00:02:43.870" style="s2">steering away from that and as and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.100" end="00:02:46.540" style="s2">saying that won&#39;t happen or it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.870" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">happen or that&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.540" end="00:02:50.620" style="s2">steer into it and say okay if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:52.360" style="s2">gonna build vibrant communities of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.620" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">practice how do we build ethical cults</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.360" end="00:02:56.590" style="s2">and and what I would imagine and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">clearly a conversation for us all to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.590" end="00:03:00.760" style="s2">figure out but what I would imagine is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">that you know we&#39;ve seen this movie</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.760" end="00:03:05.410" style="s2">before we know how this goes badly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:08.260" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had about a half century of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.410" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">you know Eastern hierarchical lineage</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.260" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">traditions getting buggered up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:14.200" style="s2">bastardized and imported into the West</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">and varying kind of gurus with feet of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.200" end="00:03:18.520" style="s2">clay stepping up to lead Children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.440" style="s2">Crusade you know that all just go off</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.520" end="00:03:21.940" style="s2">the cliff and so the question would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.440" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to build ethical cults</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.940" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">VA you know are they experimental and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">experiential so that there is no Dogma</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:33.070" style="s2">or doctrine to buy into they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">decentralized so that people maintain</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.070" end="00:03:38.950" style="s2">their own common sense their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:41.740" style="s2">judgment and their own agency and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.950" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">are they pointed towards I would hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.740" end="00:03:47.800" style="s2">some sort of social good or action and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">and can you and and all of the the known</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.800" end="00:03:52.870" style="s2">issues of dysfunctional cult can we just</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">say hey let&#39;s just forever be vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.870" end="00:03:58.390" style="s2">about shared in groups about specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:04:01.270" style="s2">vernacular about an inside-outside group</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.390" end="00:04:03.220" style="s2">mentality about mediated access to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.270" end="00:04:04.630" style="s2">ecstasy right and that&#39;s another kicker</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.220" end="00:04:05.980" style="s2">cuz they&#39;re almost in every single one</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.630" end="00:04:08.800" style="s2">of those situations where it does go</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.980" end="00:04:11.980" style="s2">wrong that group does something together</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.800" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">that creates a state experience that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.980" end="00:04:16.870" style="s2">they come to believe is exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">special and quite often is doled out or</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.870" end="00:04:21.070" style="s2">tightly controlled by the person in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:23.169" style="s2">charge and so if we create distributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.070" end="00:04:24.550" style="s2">access to techniques of ecstasy so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.169" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">everybody is on their own recognizance</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.550" end="00:04:28.039" style="s2">you know and responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2">having access to these things</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.039" end="00:04:32.090" style="s2">integrating them and growing them there</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">are no fish stories to swallow so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s open source meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:40.699" style="s2">there&#39;s no sage on the stage there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:43.160" style="s2">nobody up front there has lopsided truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.699" end="00:04:44.509" style="s2">or authority claims that maybe we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.160" end="00:04:45.949" style="s2">the chance and then also you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.509" end="00:04:47.389" style="s2">great one from a lot of religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.949" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">traditions that seems to get skipped</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.389" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">these days is an ethic of service are we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.690" end="00:04:54.470" style="s2">doing something with this or are we just</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.750" style="s2">gonna crawling up our arses and engaging</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.470" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">in endless self-development so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.750" end="00:05:00.530" style="s2">would be my hope is that is that ethical</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:03.500" style="s2">code building is the game of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.530" end="00:05:04.610" style="s2">create lots of nodes all of which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.500" end="00:05:06.199" style="s2">unique and different from each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.610" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">they all form with their own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.199" end="00:05:09.800" style="s2">local DNA and particular missions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:12.949" style="s2">purposes they may even have their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.800" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">belief systems but we can say X tosses</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.949" end="00:05:18.110" style="s2">the peak experience catharsis the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">healing and communitas become the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.110" end="00:05:22.849" style="s2">of three-legged stool that you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:25.580" style="s2">basically build tightly net highly</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.849" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">collaborative functional and effective</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.580" end="00:05:29.599" style="s2">small communities around what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:32.539" style="s2">benefit of creating these kind of flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.599" end="00:05:33.830" style="s2">States in the first place well I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.539" end="00:05:35.090" style="s2">mean the benefits of many and much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.830" end="00:05:36.860" style="s2">the research you know starting in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.090" end="00:05:38.900" style="s2">University of Chicago going through lots</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:41.659" style="s2">of other organizations and universities</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.900" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">has just been that flow states tend to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.659" end="00:05:47.419" style="s2">create a lot of positive benefits</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:49.849" style="s2">including heightened and more precise</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.419" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">decision-making a lot of sort of rather</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:55.010" style="s2">of meditation in action so you have</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.130" end="00:06:18.349" style="s2">about those peak States almost like when</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:19.789" style="s2">your laptop has been left open too long</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.349" end="00:06:21.289" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got too many browser windows</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.789" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2">open it starts bogging down and getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.289" end="00:06:25.880" style="s2">glitchy and that&#39;s kind of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">these days so that continuous partial</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.880" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">attention there&#39;s never a time where we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.310" end="00:06:32.630" style="s2">truly decompress even on planes now how</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.490" style="s2">do those Wi-Fi follows us everywhere our</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.630" end="00:06:36.229" style="s2">smartphones follow us everywhere the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.490" end="00:06:39.139" style="s2">natural rhythms of life have all just</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.229" end="00:06:40.510" style="s2">been ironed out even in you know urinals</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.139" end="00:06:43.930" style="s2">and gas stations we&#39;re getting bombed by</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.510" end="00:06:46.210" style="s2">laughs there&#39;s just no down time so most</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.930" end="00:06:49.270" style="s2">of us are suffering from some version of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.210" end="00:06:51.070" style="s2">sort of almost micro PTSD constantly our</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.270" end="00:06:53.410" style="s2">nervous systems are just fibrillating</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.070" end="00:06:56.380" style="s2">and so cultivating these peak states is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.410" end="00:06:58.210" style="s2">like just doing a cold reset on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.380" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">laptop it just lets our nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.210" end="00:07:04.180" style="s2">power down and then when we come back</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:07.240" style="s2">online we come back to a neutral balance</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.180" end="00:07:09.190" style="s2">spot and from there we have choice and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.240" end="00:07:10.930" style="s2">it may not last for a long time we may</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.190" end="00:07:13.420" style="s2">get overwhelmed with the wind with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.930" end="00:07:16.090" style="s2">barrage again but at least we have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.420" end="00:07:18.070" style="s2">bit of space to return to Center and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.090" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">start living from there again and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.070" end="00:07:23.470" style="s2">more regularly we can do that then that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.460" end="00:07:25.720" style="s2">becomes that becomes a known location</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.470" end="00:07:28.600" style="s2">and we can kind of use it to find</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:30.130" style="s2">ourselves again and with the onslaught</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.600" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">of you know all the information these</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.130" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">none ordinary states are these what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:36.040" style="s2">tangrowth for example was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:37.810" style="s2">yeah absolutely and and non-ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.040" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">states literally can mean anything other</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:41.980" style="s2">than waking state consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.720" style="s2">stealing fire and in general in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:45.460" style="s2">of optimal psychology space we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.720" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">skew to the ones I mean schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.460" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">would be a non-ordinary states will be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:51.610" style="s2">non-ordinary state manias would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.590" style="s2">non-ordinary states as well but i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.610" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">stan grof and and that the rest of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.590" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">sort of broad discipline would generally</p>
