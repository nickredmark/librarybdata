<p begin="00:00:13.059" end="00:00:20.990" style="s2">hello everyone it&#39;s been a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.060" end="00:00:23.419" style="s2">day so I&#39;m going to tell you about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.990" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">happened and then I&#39;ll start the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.419" end="00:00:31.939" style="s2">so I got up this morning and started to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:36.710" style="s2">put my day together and then I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.939" end="00:00:39.710" style="s2">sign into my gmail account and it said</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.710" end="00:00:43.930" style="s2">that it had been disabled because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.710" end="00:00:48.500" style="s2">violated the terms of service with Gmail</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.930" end="00:00:51.650" style="s2">and I thought well I didn&#39;t violate any</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.500" end="00:00:53.900" style="s2">Terms of Service that I know of now I</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.650" end="00:00:56.690" style="s2">set up a new YouTube channel yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.900" end="00:00:58.430" style="s2">called Jordan B Peterson clips and so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.690" end="00:00:59.900" style="s2">made some technical changes and so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.430" end="00:01:03.110" style="s2">thought maybe it had something to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.900" end="00:01:07.430" style="s2">with that and I had been shout out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.110" end="00:01:10.579" style="s2">Google one other time years ago so when</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.430" end="00:01:13.579" style="s2">you get a shout out like that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.579" end="00:01:15.649" style="s2">little form you can fill out and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.579" end="00:01:19.009" style="s2">filled out the form and I said that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.649" end="00:01:21.890" style="s2">had been shut out and that I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.009" end="00:01:26.179" style="s2">why and I sent it off and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.890" end="00:01:28.460" style="s2">realized one of my staff members called</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.179" end="00:01:29.659" style="s2">me and said that she was locked out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.460" end="00:01:32.359" style="s2">the YouTube account</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.659" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">oh yeah the YouTube account is hooked to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.359" end="00:01:36.469" style="s2">the gmail account so that meant that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:38.359" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get access to any of my youtube</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.469" end="00:01:39.829" style="s2">videos they were still up and online but</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.359" end="00:01:42.710" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t get access to them I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.829" end="00:01:43.969" style="s2">post last week&#39;s biblical lecture for 4</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.710" end="00:01:46.340" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.969" end="00:01:50.569" style="s2">and so that was worrisome and made me</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.340" end="00:01:52.189" style="s2">suspicious and then about two hours</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.569" end="00:01:54.920" style="s2">later or something like that I got an</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.189" end="00:01:58.189" style="s2">email from Google and they said that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.920" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">they had reviewed my request to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.189" end="00:02:04.069" style="s2">reinstated and that I had violated</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.450" style="s2">Google&#39;s Terms of agreement or a Terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.069" end="00:02:08.660" style="s2">of Service and they weren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.450" end="00:02:11.990" style="s2">turn my account back on and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.660" end="00:02:13.940" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t say why they didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.990" end="00:02:15.439" style="s2">anything I got there is no warning</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">whatsoever about any of this they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.439" end="00:02:19.670" style="s2">tell me why and they didn&#39;t say why in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:21.770" style="s2">the email response and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.670" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">I wrote them back and I said because</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.770" end="00:02:27.849" style="s2">they said I could I wrote them back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:31.970" style="s2">I said this might not be a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.849" end="00:02:34.550" style="s2">basically and you might want to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:35.690" style="s2">about it and then I twittered tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.550" end="00:02:37.340" style="s2">what had happened right I took</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.690" end="00:02:39.800" style="s2">screenshots and I tweeted and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.340" end="00:02:41.810" style="s2">contacted a whole bunch of journalists</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.800" end="00:02:45.530" style="s2">because it turns out that I know a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.810" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">bunch of journalists and so and so then</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.530" end="00:02:52.730" style="s2">what happened then was that I got a call</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">from the Daily Caller in the United</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.730" end="00:02:57.110" style="s2">States I had done an interview with them</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:02:59.810" style="s2">last week which isn&#39;t posted yet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">they interviewed me and within 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.810" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">minutes posted it online and so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:05.780" style="s2">have a fairly big audience and so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:07.510" style="s2">was good and then somebody phoned me</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">from Ottawa and I did a live radio show</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.510" end="00:03:12.799" style="s2">about that and that was good and then a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:14.920" style="s2">number of other journalists contacted me</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.799" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">and I sent them the information but</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.920" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">another one of my staff and actually my</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">son emailed me and he said look you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:23.000" style="s2">should hold off because maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:24.950" style="s2">still a mistake here and I thought yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.000" end="00:03:27.950" style="s2">there might be it might be just a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.950" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">mistake but then why in the world did I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.950" end="00:03:31.609" style="s2">email Google and they contacted me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:32.780" style="s2">they said they would not reinstate it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.609" end="00:03:36.440" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t provide me with any</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.780" end="00:03:37.910" style="s2">information so I contacted the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.440" end="00:03:39.769" style="s2">journalists and I said well you never</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.910" end="00:03:42.859" style="s2">know maybe this is just a mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.769" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">let&#39;s hold off and then well I was about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.859" end="00:03:47.780" style="s2">half an hour later while I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.410" end="00:03:49.609" style="s2">get into my I used this AdWords account</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.780" end="00:03:52.010" style="s2">that&#39;s Luke link to Google I don&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.609" end="00:03:54.049" style="s2">ads on my videos but I need the AdWords</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.010" end="00:03:55.820" style="s2">account because it helps me add some</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.049" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">little gadgets to the videos that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.820" end="00:04:00.140" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t otherwise be able to and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:03.109" style="s2">I was playing with that the system came</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.140" end="00:04:05.750" style="s2">back online I thought well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">interesting and lots of people had</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">emailed me and twittered me and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:11.090" style="s2">people within Google and some people</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:12.709" style="s2">elsewhere and they were doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.090" end="00:04:14.569" style="s2">they were going to do to help me get all</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.709" end="00:04:17.539" style="s2">this material back up and running and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.569" end="00:04:20.120" style="s2">something worked my suspicions are that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.539" end="00:04:22.389" style="s2">what worked was the publicity now so but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.120" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">maybe not you know and it&#39;s very weird</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.389" end="00:04:28.669" style="s2">being in this situation because there</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:31.010" style="s2">has been a number of recent episodes</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">where these larger companies Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.010" end="00:04:35.000" style="s2">Google patreon</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:36.259" style="s2">not that it&#39;s a massive company but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:39.770" style="s2">starting to become reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.259" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">significant have decided on rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.770" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">arbitrary grounds to shut down their</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:47.659" style="s2">users and this is very ominous to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:49.550" style="s2">partly because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve turned our</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.659" end="00:04:51.710" style="s2">communications over to very large</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.550" end="00:04:53.539" style="s2">systems or very large systems have</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.710" end="00:04:54.919" style="s2">emerged to mediate our communication</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.539" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">right I mean there&#39;s lots of benefit to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.919" end="00:04:59.539" style="s2">it so you don&#39;t want to get too cynical</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:02.710" style="s2">about it but we&#39;re blind with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.539" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">the policies that regulate the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.710" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">actions the regulatory actions of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:08.659" style="s2">large organizations and that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">bad thing and something else is even</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.659" end="00:05:13.250" style="s2">more ominous really ominous you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:16.849" style="s2">it&#39;s highly probable that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.250" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">build political algorithms into our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.849" end="00:05:20.300" style="s2">artificial intelligence and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">thing will be regulated by machines that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.300" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">no one understands and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">bad idea and that&#39;s a really likely</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:29.719" style="s2">possibility so anyways I was all</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:32.030" style="s2">confused about this I thought Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.719" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">maybe I flew off the handle you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.030" end="00:05:36.139" style="s2">because I was sort of it was stressful</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:37.880" style="s2">man you know because I have like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.139" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">hundred and fifty thousand emails in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.880" end="00:05:42.050" style="s2">that account like that&#39;s a lot of emails</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:43.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s all my correspondence for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.050" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">last ten years you know so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.580" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">archive as well as an ongoing email</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:50.659" style="s2">system I have a commercial email system</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:52.490" style="s2">that I just set up three weeks ago with</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.659" end="00:05:54.169" style="s2">like six different email addresses now</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.490" end="00:05:55.610" style="s2">to try to organize my correspondence so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.169" end="00:05:58.039" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t completely unable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.610" end="00:05:59.900" style="s2">communicate but my calendar was gone and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.039" end="00:06:01.849" style="s2">that&#39;s a bloody disaster because like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.900" end="00:06:03.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve got things scheduled out forever</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.849" end="00:06:05.719" style="s2">and I don&#39;t remember what they are I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.710" end="00:06:09.139" style="s2">can&#39;t even remember what I&#39;m doing in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.719" end="00:06:10.849" style="s2">day so much less in a month but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.139" end="00:06:12.199" style="s2">thought maybe I flew off the handle and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.849" end="00:06:14.300" style="s2">I was worried that I contacted the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.199" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">journalist too soon and you know but</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.300" end="00:06:19.909" style="s2">anyways it all worked out so then what</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:22.879" style="s2">happened well just as I was coming to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.909" end="00:06:24.860" style="s2">this lecture I stepped outside and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.879" end="00:06:27.770" style="s2">was a little package outside and luckily</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.860" end="00:06:29.509" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a bomb there was a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.770" end="00:06:30.979" style="s2">package outside nice little packages and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.509" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">we looked my wife and I looked inside it</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.979" end="00:06:34.490" style="s2">there was a couple of bottles of wine in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.599" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">there so that was nice and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.490" end="00:06:37.460" style="s2">little note and so I&#39;m gonna read you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:45.259" style="s2">the little note because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.460" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">pretty interesting so so this person</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.259" end="00:06:48.620" style="s2">said that they had finally tackled</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:50.410" style="s2">self altering sweets oh they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.620" end="00:06:53.810" style="s2">happy about that but that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.410" end="00:06:55.700" style="s2">interesting except peripherally a friend</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">on Twitter has contact with Google</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.700" end="00:07:02.750" style="s2">engineers she said quote I spoke with</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">some friends inside Google who offered</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.750" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">to help and I did get contacted by quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:08.360" style="s2">a few people at Google who said that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.680" end="00:07:10.610" style="s2">they had been you know watching my</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.360" end="00:07:13.940" style="s2">lectures and so on and were happy about</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.610" end="00:07:15.560" style="s2">what I was doing anyways I spoke with</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.940" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">some friends inside Google who offered</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:18.860" style="s2">to help but they suggest he set up a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.140" style="s2">back-up plan</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.860" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">the teams are feeling significant</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.140" end="00:07:28.370" style="s2">pressure from advocacy groups and quote</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">I have at least four Google engineers</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.370" end="00:07:33.010" style="s2">who offered to speak up on his behalf</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:37.180" style="s2">but they know the team dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.010" end="00:07:42.320" style="s2">unfortunately especially YouTube is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.180" end="00:07:44.870" style="s2">SJW cesspool I hope this information is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.320" end="00:07:48.590" style="s2">useful to you it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.870" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">of useful alright so that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.590" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">part of what happened today and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.010" end="00:07:57.320" style="s2">anyways I still don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:07:59.750" style="s2">it right because I don&#39;t know why it got</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.320" end="00:08:01.670" style="s2">shut down and I don&#39;t know if anything I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.750" end="00:08:03.890" style="s2">did got it turned back on and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.670" end="00:08:07.880" style="s2">know the reasons for it and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.890" end="00:08:10.880" style="s2">rather ominous it seems to me that when</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.880" end="00:08:14.900" style="s2">I was thinking it through and was that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.880" end="00:08:15.670" style="s2">know I have a fairly what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.900" end="00:08:17.990" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.670" end="00:08:19.010" style="s2">respectable YouTube following I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.990" end="00:08:21.230" style="s2">know if you&#39;d necessarily call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:24.710" style="s2">respectable it&#39;s fairly large YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.230" end="00:08:28.070" style="s2">following and it seems to me that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.710" end="00:08:29.390" style="s2">would have been appropriate for Google</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.070" end="00:08:33.800" style="s2">if they were going to shut down my</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.390" end="00:08:36.770" style="s2">account to tell me why I would think and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">also maybe look me up maybe especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.770" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">after I emailed them and then maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:43.250" style="s2">to have emailed me back and said no</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:44.570" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to reinstate you but</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.250" end="00:08:45.950" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to tell you any reasons</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.570" end="00:08:47.870" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t say they wouldn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.950" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">me any reasons they just didn&#39;t tell me</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.870" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">any reasons and then it also seems very</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.270" end="00:08:56.810" style="s2">strange to me that it just all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.760" end="00:09:00.529" style="s2">sudden went back on after two hours and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.810" end="00:09:03.949" style="s2">so well so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.529" end="00:09:06.769" style="s2">that may be more information will come</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.949" end="00:09:09.980" style="s2">to light over the next few days I hope</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.769" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t jump the gun but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.980" end="00:09:15.860" style="s2">a very peculiar set of circumstances I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:17.689" style="s2">thought it was kind of amusing actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.860" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">that the video that they stopped me from</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.689" end="00:09:21.649" style="s2">posting today was the last biblical</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:22.879" style="s2">lecture you wouldn&#39;t necessarily think</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.649" end="00:09:24.259" style="s2">that that would be the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.879" end="00:09:27.230" style="s2">that people would want to stop from</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.259" end="00:09:28.459" style="s2">being posted but we&#39;re in very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.230" end="00:09:32.689" style="s2">strange times</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.459" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">so that was my adventure for today and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.689" end="00:09:38.930" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t you know I hate speakers who</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:42.139" style="s2">apologize to the crowd before they talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.930" end="00:09:44.329" style="s2">to them because you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.139" end="00:09:45.709" style="s2">speaking to people and they put all this</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.329" end="00:09:47.660" style="s2">effort into coming then you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.709" end="00:09:49.699" style="s2">tell them what a sorry and useless</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.660" end="00:09:52.040" style="s2">creature you are before you talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.699" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">you know and ask for their forbearance</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.040" end="00:09:56.300" style="s2">and forgiveness it&#39;s like it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:57.889" style="s2">you&#39;re a little late for that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.300" end="00:10:00.050" style="s2">still gonna do that a little bit today</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.889" end="00:10:01.699" style="s2">because you know I wanted to spend all</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.050" end="00:10:03.709" style="s2">day preparing this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.699" end="00:10:06.500" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve prepared it a lot before him</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.709" end="00:10:08.420" style="s2">but that rattled me up a lot and so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.500" end="00:10:11.569" style="s2">didn&#39;t prepare as much as I could have</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.420" end="00:10:16.009" style="s2">anyways we&#39;ll stumble forward and see</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.569" end="00:10:19.300" style="s2">how it goes I I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.009" end="00:10:23.629" style="s2">familiar with the stories now and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.300" end="00:10:27.220" style="s2">onward and upward so I&#39;m gonna reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.629" end="00:10:30.439" style="s2">this you know I&#39;ve learned something I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:32.769" style="s2">have this idea that it would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.439" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">idea for young people and older people</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.769" end="00:10:38.750" style="s2">citizens of the west let&#39;s say to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:40.790" style="s2">more about their culture and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.750" end="00:10:43.639" style="s2">civilization right because it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.790" end="00:10:46.129" style="s2">civilization and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s taken a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.639" end="00:10:47.990" style="s2">lot of work to put together but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.129" end="00:10:49.579" style="s2">think that we really know you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.990" end="00:10:51.290" style="s2">know a fair a bit about it although I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.579" end="00:10:54.709" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t consider myself nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:57.589" style="s2">educated as a person should be but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.709" end="00:11:00.019" style="s2">not too badly educated and but I tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.589" end="00:11:02.839" style="s2">you going through these biblical</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.019" end="00:11:05.029" style="s2">lectures verse by verse just makes me</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.839" end="00:11:08.120" style="s2">even more aware of how unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.029" end="00:11:10.009" style="s2">ignorant I am you know and partly for</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.120" end="00:11:12.949" style="s2">two two reasons like one is because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.009" end="00:11:14.450" style="s2">been using this Bible hub calm place and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.949" end="00:11:15.950" style="s2">I think I told you last week</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.450" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">but I wanted to reiterate it because</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.950" end="00:11:20.780" style="s2">it&#39;s important it&#39;s so interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">way that they&#39;ve set it up because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.780" end="00:11:25.820" style="s2">can go through the biblical stories</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:28.700" style="s2">verse by verse and then for each verse</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.820" end="00:11:30.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole small font page of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.700" end="00:11:32.960" style="s2">commentary from multiple sources and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.860" end="00:11:35.330" style="s2">you know not only is the Bible hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.960" end="00:11:37.010" style="s2">hyperlinked in the way that I discussed</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.330" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">in the first lecture with all the verses</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.010" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">referring to not all the other verses</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:44.660" style="s2">but lots of them but it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:46.610" style="s2">got its tendrils out into literature you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.660" end="00:11:49.100" style="s2">know direct commentaries on the text but</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.610" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">also although all the literature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:53.720" style="s2">been influenced by it so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:56.570" style="s2">an unbelievably central and core text</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.720" end="00:11:59.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s so interesting to read a book</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.570" end="00:12:01.910" style="s2">where every sentence has been commented</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.150" end="00:12:03.710" style="s2">on what really in volumes and then just</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.910" end="00:12:05.750" style="s2">to get a sense of that volume of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.710" end="00:12:08.210" style="s2">material you know how much power brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.750" end="00:12:11.180" style="s2">power there&#39;s been put into this and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.210" end="00:12:14.150" style="s2">to also understand how bloody ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.180" end="00:12:16.340" style="s2">like I&#39;m so ignorant about this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.150" end="00:12:18.710" style="s2">all this work and and it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.340" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve left it to decay in the dust and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.710" end="00:12:21.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a big mistake man it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.300" end="00:12:24.290" style="s2">mistake because the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.770" end="00:12:26.330" style="s2">writing these commentaries like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.290" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">a lot of its from the 14th and 15th and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.330" end="00:12:30.650" style="s2">16th century it&#39;s kind of archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s some of it&#39;s outdated and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.650" end="00:12:34.070" style="s2">some of it you wouldn&#39;t agree with but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.880" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">if you read all the commentaries side by</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.070" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">side you know you get a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.300" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">blast of wisdom coming at you and like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:42.440" style="s2">the thing about wisdom is it stops you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:45.620" style="s2">from running face-first into walls you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.440" end="00:12:47.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s not just there to to so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.620" end="00:12:49.430" style="s2">you can talk to people at parties about</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.480" end="00:12:51.650" style="s2">what university you graduated from you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.430" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">know and it&#39;s there because the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.650" end="00:12:55.850" style="s2">information is unbelievably useful you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:12:57.050" style="s2">know one of the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:12:58.610" style="s2">realized that I want to return to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.050" end="00:13:00.530" style="s2">tonight because I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.610" end="00:13:02.090" style="s2">about this idea of the arc you know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.530" end="00:13:04.670" style="s2">I think I mentioned to you last week</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.090" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">that I&#39;d figured out that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.670" end="00:13:07.940" style="s2">idea that Noah was perfect in his</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.710" style="s2">generations and that meant that he has</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.940" end="00:13:11.150" style="s2">said his family in order wasn&#39;t just him</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.710" end="00:13:12.920" style="s2">but he had said his family in order and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.150" end="00:13:15.620" style="s2">because of that when when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.920" end="00:13:17.780" style="s2">catastrophe came like it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:19.880" style="s2">everyone he was able to withstand it</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.780" end="00:13:21.950" style="s2">because he had the support of the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.880" end="00:13:23.780" style="s2">who were near and dear to him and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.950" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">really important when things come along</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.780" end="00:13:27.790" style="s2">to lay you low like if you&#39;re alone and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:31.129" style="s2">the flood comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.790" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">man goodbye to you if you&#39;ve got 10 or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.129" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">15 people supporting you in a tight</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:36.889" style="s2">Network you know and and your your</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.029" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">interrelationships with them or pristine</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.889" end="00:13:40.369" style="s2">and you can tell them the truth and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.139" style="s2">can tell the truth back to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.369" end="00:13:45.050" style="s2">possible that you might be able to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.139" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">that thin way that will preserve you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.050" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">when when when when you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:53.569" style="s2">terrible things come knocking at your</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:56.389" style="s2">door and so there&#39;s this the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.569" end="00:13:58.579" style="s2">ark is very very concrete in Noah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.389" end="00:14:00.259" style="s2">actually a structure that that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.579" end="00:14:02.629" style="s2">inhabits you know it&#39;s a concrete eyes</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.259" end="00:14:04.610" style="s2">almost like a child&#39;s story and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.629" end="00:14:06.379" style="s2">not being cynical about that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.610" end="00:14:08.420" style="s2">there are some bloody brilliant Charles</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.379" end="00:14:09.949" style="s2">to children&#39;s stories but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.420" end="00:14:11.720" style="s2">really concrete eyes but then Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.949" end="00:14:14.449" style="s2">comes along and instead of an ark</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.720" end="00:14:16.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a covenant right now it says in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.449" end="00:14:19.100" style="s2">the story of Noah that Noah walked with</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.519" end="00:14:20.899" style="s2">God and and of course Abraham it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.100" end="00:14:22.699" style="s2">clear exactly did he&#39;s walking with God</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.899" end="00:14:25.129" style="s2">or before God which we&#39;ll get into later</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.699" end="00:14:27.649" style="s2">but you see I see this as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.129" end="00:14:30.889" style="s2">increasing cycle psychologize ation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.649" end="00:14:34.129" style="s2">the sacred ideas that were acted out by</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.889" end="00:14:36.620" style="s2">archaic people so first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.129" end="00:14:38.899" style="s2">concretize in the form of a ship that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.620" end="00:14:40.759" style="s2">actually sustains you when the floods</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.899" end="00:14:42.110" style="s2">come right it&#39;s it&#39;s very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.759" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">imagery the sort of thing you might see</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.110" end="00:14:46.670" style="s2">in a movie but then with Abraham it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:48.230" style="s2">turns into a psychological covenant in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.670" end="00:14:50.209" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s like a contractual</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.230" end="00:14:51.829" style="s2">agreement now it&#39;s a country it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.209" end="00:14:54.379" style="s2">contractual agreement between Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.829" end="00:14:56.600" style="s2">and God but but that doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.379" end="00:14:59.870" style="s2">matter that I mean obviously it matters</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.600" end="00:15:01.910" style="s2">but it&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s only it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.870" end="00:15:03.949" style="s2">half of what&#39;s important about that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.910" end="00:15:07.160" style="s2">other half is that it&#39;s a contract and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.949" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">you know one of the things that you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.160" end="00:15:10.549" style="s2">with your ideal let&#39;s say is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:12.529" style="s2">establish a contract with it you also</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.549" end="00:15:14.179" style="s2">establish like a social contract with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.529" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">other people right that&#39;s what keeps</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.179" end="00:15:18.980" style="s2">society organized and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:21.410" style="s2">idea that emerges in the Abraham stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.980" end="00:15:24.529" style="s2">of a sacred contract and that has the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.410" end="00:15:26.029" style="s2">same function as the Ark and what it</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.529" end="00:15:28.509" style="s2">does because what happens in Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.029" end="00:15:30.889" style="s2">we&#39;ll see more of this today is that he</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.509" end="00:15:32.420" style="s2">you know God tells him to go forward</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.889" end="00:15:33.829" style="s2">into the world and we&#39;ve we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.420" end="00:15:35.569" style="s2">that last week and he does that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.829" end="00:15:37.309" style="s2">encounters famine and the encounters</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.569" end="00:15:39.319" style="s2">tyranny and he encounters powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.309" end="00:15:41.750" style="s2">people who want to take from him what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.319" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">his I mean god sends about</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.750" end="00:15:44.930" style="s2">world but it&#39;s not like he has an easy</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:47.000" style="s2">ride of it it isn&#39;t easy at all it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:49.820" style="s2">hard as it can be but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.000" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">consistent emphasis in the text and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.820" end="00:15:53.630" style="s2">think it&#39;s something really worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:56.150" style="s2">attending to that if you maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.630" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">contract which and that has that has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.150" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">do with honesty and trust and truth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">all of those things if you maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:05.210" style="s2">contract and you have a good possibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.950" style="s2">the best possible possibility of making</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.210" end="00:16:10.340" style="s2">your way through the catastrophe in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.950" end="00:16:12.650" style="s2">chaos and I don&#39;t want to be naive about</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.340" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">this you know when I read young and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.650" end="00:16:15.560" style="s2">started to understand the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:19.010" style="s2">hero archetype you know the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.560" end="00:16:20.960" style="s2">the human being is a is a force a logo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.010" end="00:16:23.270" style="s2">force that can stand up against chaos</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.960" end="00:16:25.850" style="s2">and catastrophe and tragedy and evil and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.270" end="00:16:28.370" style="s2">prevail I never did think that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.850" end="00:16:29.330" style="s2">meant that if you did stand up and tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.370" end="00:16:32.330" style="s2">the truth that you would necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.330" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">prevail right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.330" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">a magic trick it&#39;s your best bet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:39.710" style="s2">the thing you don&#39;t have a better option</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:42.260" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.710" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">that I see the idea is emerging in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.260" end="00:16:45.140" style="s2">Abrahamic texts it&#39;s like people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:46.940" style="s2">figuring this out that would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.140" end="00:16:48.440" style="s2">progressive revelation that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.940" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">thinking about it and you can think</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.440" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">about that religious terms but you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:54.589" style="s2">also think about it as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:56.510" style="s2">consulting itself right each individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.589" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">talking to themselves which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.510" end="00:17:00.200" style="s2">do when we when we think and each</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:03.230" style="s2">individual communicating with every</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.200" end="00:17:06.199" style="s2">other individual and gathering a body of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.230" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">wisdom that helps people or orient</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.199" end="00:17:10.670" style="s2">themselves in the toughest conditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:12.170" style="s2">and it&#39;s an incremental process and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.670" end="00:17:15.800" style="s2">think that I really do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.170" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">that&#39;s speaking purely secularly I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.800" end="00:17:19.339" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s what manifests</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:21.290" style="s2">itself in the biblical stories right</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:23.959" style="s2">it&#39;s the dawning enlightenment of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.290" end="00:17:25.939" style="s2">mankind something like that as we start</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.959" end="00:17:27.680" style="s2">to understand the principles by which we</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.939" end="00:17:31.970" style="s2">have to live in order to orient</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.680" end="00:17:34.940" style="s2">ourselves properly in the world so and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.970" end="00:17:36.830" style="s2">also do believe and this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:39.470" style="s2">thing that&#39;s the unspoken question is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.830" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.470" end="00:17:47.450" style="s2">how rich and fulfilling your life could</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:50.120" style="s2">be despite its tragedy and limitation if</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.450" end="00:17:51.620" style="s2">you stop doing the things that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.120" end="00:17:53.570" style="s2">to be wrong it&#39;s a really grand</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.620" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">experiment and you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">things that God tells Abraham Kahn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.290" style="s2">as as the story progresses especially</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:03.800" style="s2">every time Abraham makes a sacrifice as</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.290" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">God says walk with me and be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.800" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:11.570" style="s2">injunction is will aim high establish</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:13.580" style="s2">this relationship with the highest thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.570" end="00:18:15.559" style="s2">that you can conceive of which you might</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.580" end="00:18:16.340" style="s2">as well do that because well what are</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.559" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">you gonna do is to have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.340" end="00:18:20.300" style="s2">relationship with the most mediocre</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.590" style="s2">thing you can conceive of or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.300" end="00:18:23.780" style="s2">gonna establish relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.590" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">lowest thing you can conceive of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.780" end="00:18:29.030" style="s2">do that and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:31.940" style="s2">a really bad thing and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.030" end="00:18:33.710" style="s2">pain associated with that and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.940" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">know there&#39;s the there&#39;s pain that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.710" end="00:18:37.670" style="s2">expand into a world destroying force</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.890" style="s2">down that route and there&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.670" end="00:18:42.020" style="s2">no doubt about that so what is there</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.890" end="00:18:44.179" style="s2">something superstitious and foolish</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:46.790" style="s2">about attempting to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.179" end="00:18:50.420" style="s2">contractual relationship with the source</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.790" end="00:18:53.350" style="s2">of all being I mean I I just don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.420" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">that as a as an erroneous conception and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.350" end="00:18:59.690" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not necessary perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">get lost in the details we can argue</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.690" end="00:19:03.830" style="s2">forever about what God might or might</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:06.980" style="s2">not be but we could at least say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.830" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">the concept of God is an embodiment of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.980" end="00:19:11.330" style="s2">humanity&#39;s highest ideal right we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.850" style="s2">at least agree on that and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.330" end="00:19:15.730" style="s2">might say well is that real and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.850" end="00:19:17.809" style="s2">first thing I would say about that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:19.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things about the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.809" end="00:19:22.700" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand and the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.790" end="00:19:24.620" style="s2">I would say is it depends bloody well on</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.700" end="00:19:26.030" style="s2">what you mean by real that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.620" end="00:19:34.090" style="s2">and that turns out to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:36.980" style="s2">complicated question so okay so we left</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.090" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">Abram remember at the end last time he</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.980" end="00:19:41.240" style="s2">had just gone off to fight a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.980" style="s2">kings and get his nephew back which</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.240" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">seemed to be a pretty courageous act and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.980" end="00:19:47.780" style="s2">so that brought a story to an end and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:50.420" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I think what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.780" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">the narrative is that there&#39;s a story so</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.420" end="00:19:53.210" style="s2">Abraham is somewhere and he goes</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:55.220" style="s2">somewhere else right that&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.210" end="00:19:57.559" style="s2">and he has adventures along the way and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">those adventures are usually the typical</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.559" end="00:20:02.330" style="s2">kind of adventure which is a riff in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:04.690" style="s2">structure of the story and exposure to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.330" end="00:20:07.700" style="s2">kind of chaos and novelty and then a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.690" end="00:20:08.820" style="s2">reconstitution of the of the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.700" end="00:20:10.440" style="s2">being so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.820" end="00:20:12.299" style="s2">it&#39;s a classic story right you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:13.769" style="s2">somewhere you&#39;re a certain way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.299" end="00:20:15.299" style="s2">moving forward something happens that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.769" end="00:20:17.940" style="s2">you don&#39;t expect it blows you into</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.299" end="00:20:20.130" style="s2">pieces it introduces chaos right you you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.940" end="00:20:21.539" style="s2">face the drag and you get the gold or</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.130" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">maybe the bloody thing eats you and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.539" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">story is over and then and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:26.669" style="s2">to where you&#39;re going but then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.320" end="00:20:27.960" style="s2">question is well what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.669" end="00:20:31.769" style="s2">get to where you&#39;re going and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.960" end="00:20:33.269" style="s2">really important issue because one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.769" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">the things that happens to people all</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.269" end="00:20:36.779" style="s2">the time in their life is that they get</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.850" style="s2">to where they&#39;re going and then they</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.779" end="00:20:40.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do right so for</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.850" end="00:20:41.809" style="s2">example you graduate from university</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.679" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.809" end="00:20:49.769" style="s2">story over who are you now who are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">the next day and so so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.769" end="00:20:54.299" style="s2">when you succeed then there&#39;s a success</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:57.659" style="s2">crisis and the success crisis is well</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.299" end="00:21:00.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve run this story to its end now what</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.659" end="00:21:01.649" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what happens in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.120" end="00:21:04.740" style="s2">the Abrahamic stories and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.649" end="00:21:07.019" style="s2">punctuated by a period of contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.740" end="00:21:10.789" style="s2">and sacrifice so every time an Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.019" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">story comes to its end then Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.789" end="00:21:14.879" style="s2">makes another sacrifice and communes</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:17.639" style="s2">with God and then he figures out what to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.879" end="00:21:20.009" style="s2">do next and that seems that seems right</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.639" end="00:21:22.110" style="s2">it seems psychologically right because</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.009" end="00:21:23.460" style="s2">what you should do when your story comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.110" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">to an end when you&#39;ve achieved what it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.460" end="00:21:27.179" style="s2">is that you want to achieve or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:28.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re in terribly dire straits but</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.179" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">we won&#39;t talk about that at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:32.009" style="s2">when you&#39;ve achieved what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:34.830" style="s2">achieve then the next question is okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.009" end="00:21:38.429" style="s2">well now I&#39;m that person or I have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.830" end="00:21:40.019" style="s2">character what what do I need to do next</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.429" end="00:21:41.759" style="s2">and some of that is always well what do</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.019" end="00:21:43.320" style="s2">I need to give up now what do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.759" end="00:21:45.299" style="s2">let go of so I can move to the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.320" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">plateau right assume that your life is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.299" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">hopefully a sequence of upward moving</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">what would you call them it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:54.779" style="s2">Sisyphus except you&#39;re actually each</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.129" style="s2">time you climb up the mountain you get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.779" end="00:21:58.200" style="s2">little higher on the mountain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.129" end="00:22:00.840" style="s2">something like that so it&#39;s Sisyphus</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.200" end="00:22:02.669" style="s2">with an optimistic bent and and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.840" end="00:22:04.259" style="s2">maybe if you push the rock up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.669" end="00:22:06.419" style="s2">mountain properly and let it roll down</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.259" end="00:22:08.190" style="s2">then and if you do that right then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.419" end="00:22:10.830" style="s2">okay every time you roll it back up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.190" end="00:22:14.360" style="s2">it&#39;s better in some sense I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.830" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">that&#39;s unrealistic either and so well</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.360" end="00:22:20.340" style="s2">Abraham goes and rescues his nephew from</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:22.139" style="s2">these two tyrannical kings that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.340" end="00:22:22.770" style="s2">brave and he doesn&#39;t take any reward for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.139" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">it because his</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.770" end="00:22:27.660" style="s2">he&#39;s concerned it&#39;s just a manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:30.510" style="s2">of the right thing and then he has</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:31.800" style="s2">another vision after these things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.510" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">the battle the word of the Lord came</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.800" end="00:22:36.210" style="s2">unto Abram in a vision saying fear not</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:39.030" style="s2">Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.210" end="00:22:40.590" style="s2">great reward and Abram said Lord God</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.030" end="00:22:42.360" style="s2">what will I&#39;ll give me seeing I go</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.590" end="00:22:45.210" style="s2">childless and the steward of my house is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.360" end="00:22:47.640" style="s2">this Alysia of Damascus and Abram said</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.210" end="00:22:50.670" style="s2">Behold to me thou has given no seed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.640" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">lo no one born what one born in my house</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.670" end="00:22:54.780" style="s2">is mine heir and behold the word of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">Lord came to him saying this shall not</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.780" end="00:22:58.290" style="s2">be thine heir but he that shall come</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">forth out of the own tyne own bowels</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.290" end="00:23:03.090" style="s2">shall be done here and he brought him</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:05.430" style="s2">forth abroad and he said now look to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.090" end="00:23:07.560" style="s2">heaven and tell the stars if you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.430" end="00:23:10.890" style="s2">to number them number them and he said</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.560" end="00:23:12.420" style="s2">unto Him so shall thy seed be and Abram</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.890" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">believed in the Lord and he counted it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.420" end="00:23:16.290" style="s2">to him for righteousness and he said</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:18.210" style="s2">unto him I&#39;m the Lord that brought thee</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.290" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">out of ur of the Chaldees to give this</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.210" end="00:23:22.800" style="s2">land to you to inherit it and he said</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:25.500" style="s2">Lord God whereby shall I know that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.800" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">shall inherit it and then he does this</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.500" end="00:23:29.940" style="s2">sacrifice take me in effort a heifer of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.470" style="s2">three years old and a she-goat and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.940" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">Rabb and a Turtledove and a young pigeon</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.470" end="00:23:36.660" style="s2">and then God comes down and well Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">goes into a trance that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.660" end="00:23:41.910" style="s2">appears to be in the story and has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:47.100" style="s2">great terror and then God appears to him</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.910" end="00:23:49.170" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just review this commentary</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.100" end="00:23:50.730" style="s2">again this is from Joseph Benson and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.170" end="00:23:51.990" style="s2">when the Sun was going down that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.730" end="00:23:55.110" style="s2">the time when you wash up for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.990" end="00:23:56.700" style="s2">evening and he&#39;s he&#39;s praying and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.110" end="00:23:59.010" style="s2">waiting towards evening a deep sleep</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.700" end="00:24:00.570" style="s2">fell upon Abraham not a common sleep</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.010" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">through weariness or carelessness but a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.570" end="00:24:04.500" style="s2">divine ecstasy that being wholly taken</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:06.330" style="s2">off from things sensible he might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.500" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">wholly taken up with a contemplation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.330" end="00:24:11.940" style="s2">things spiritual very strange very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:13.470" style="s2">strange series of interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.940" end="00:24:15.150" style="s2">because it does seem that what happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.470" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">to Abraham that he falls into some sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.150" end="00:24:22.530" style="s2">of revelatory trance and so when as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:25.080" style="s2">taken some pains to explain we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.530" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">really understand such things and and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.080" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">can&#39;t rule out their existence because</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.730" style="s2">there&#39;s too much evidence that they do</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.730" end="00:24:35.160" style="s2">that we no longer possess that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.440" end="00:24:36.540" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.160" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">perhaps we no longer know how</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.540" end="00:24:39.810" style="s2">access these sorts of states of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:43.410" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s certainly possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.810" end="00:24:45.810" style="s2">and lo a horror of great darkness fell</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.410" end="00:24:48.060" style="s2">upon him this was designed to strike</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.810" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">upon the spirit of Abram and to possess</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.130" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2">yeah well I think that&#39;s right too like</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.690" end="00:25:02.550" style="s2">you know one of the experiences I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.400" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">in my life fairly commonly in their</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.550" end="00:25:05.790" style="s2">variety of different ways this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:07.920" style="s2">especially true when I was paying a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.790" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">of attention to my dreams which I did</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.920" end="00:25:12.090" style="s2">for about 15 years I guess something</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.010" style="s2">like that now and then I would feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.090" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">I&#39;d learned some things and had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.010" end="00:25:20.040" style="s2">consolidated them and then before I went</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">to sleep I&#39;d think okay I&#39;m ready to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:24.090" style="s2">learn something else it&#39;s like and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:25.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t say that without trepidation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.090" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">usually because usually when you learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.800" end="00:25:29.970" style="s2">something you know it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:32.100" style="s2">Pleasant because you usually learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.970" end="00:25:33.690" style="s2">something about why you&#39;re wrong and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.100" end="00:25:35.220" style="s2">deeper the thing that you learned the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">more you learn about why you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.220" end="00:25:38.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s a death that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:41.010" style="s2">with that because then you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.670" end="00:25:43.500" style="s2">that part of you that&#39;s wrong die and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.010" end="00:25:45.210" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s real that&#39;s the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.500" end="00:25:46.620" style="s2">right and so you have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.210" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">sacrifice you have to be willing to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.620" end="00:25:53.490" style="s2">a sacrifice before you&#39;re going to learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:55.800" style="s2">something and the and perhaps your what</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.490" end="00:25:58.230" style="s2">you&#39;ll learn is in proportion to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.800" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">willingness to make a sacrifice and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.230" end="00:26:05.220" style="s2">really do believe that I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:08.190" style="s2">as well because I also think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.220" end="00:26:09.570" style="s2">commit to something that means that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.190" end="00:26:11.640" style="s2">don&#39;t do a bunch of other things right</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.570" end="00:26:13.530" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the sacrifice of all those</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.640" end="00:26:15.900" style="s2">other things you commit to it you set</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.530" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">your sights on it if you really commit</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.900" end="00:26:19.890" style="s2">to it and you get the sacrifice right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:21.630" style="s2">to speak then the probability that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.890" end="00:26:23.700" style="s2">thing will be successful vastly</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.630" end="00:26:27.750" style="s2">increases and I think that that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.700" end="00:26:29.280" style="s2">not a naive or or a naive way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.750" end="00:26:31.020" style="s2">thinking or a foolish way of thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.280" end="00:26:34.890" style="s2">my experience has been that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.020" end="00:26:37.230" style="s2">case and so back to the dream I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.890" end="00:26:39.750" style="s2">do think that we learn in trepidation</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.230" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">and that most of the time if if you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.750" end="00:26:45.450" style="s2">to be laid low before the new revelation</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:47.130" style="s2">can make itself manifest and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.450" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">that&#39;s also what happens to people often</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.130" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">in psychedelic experiences when they</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:52.100" style="s2">have a bad trip</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.929" style="s2">they don&#39;t get through the bad part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.100" end="00:26:55.640" style="s2">it and maybe that&#39;s because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.929" end="00:26:57.140" style="s2">much mess in their lives now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.640" end="00:26:59.510" style="s2">speculating but it&#39;s informed</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.140" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">speculation there&#39;s so much mess in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.510" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">their lives that the altered state of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:05.179" style="s2">consciousness makes manifest that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.160" style="s2">like a little trip through hell and but</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.179" end="00:27:09.590" style="s2">the mess is so complete and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.160" end="00:27:11.420" style="s2">comprehensive and all-pervading that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.590" end="00:27:13.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no way they can get through it</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.420" end="00:27:15.230" style="s2">now if they could get through it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.550" end="00:27:17.929" style="s2">started to sort those things out then</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:19.420" style="s2">you know there would be perhaps what</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.929" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">would you call it a compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.420" end="00:27:24.770" style="s2">positive revelation at the end but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:26.059" style="s2">first thing is if you want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.770" end="00:27:29.570" style="s2">something is that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.059" end="00:27:32.600" style="s2">encounter well you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.570" end="00:27:34.850" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong before you you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.600" end="00:27:36.890" style="s2">out what wisdom you need next to guide</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.850" end="00:27:40.130" style="s2">yourself and that&#39;s no laughing matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.890" end="00:27:42.860" style="s2">right and so I think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.130" end="00:27:44.330" style="s2">the that&#39;s what this refers to I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.860" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the sort of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.330" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">experience that that refers to I also</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:51.080" style="s2">think we built this a little bit into</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.490" end="00:27:53.809" style="s2">this into the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.080" end="00:27:56.600" style="s2">you know I read this really cool paper</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.809" end="00:27:58.490" style="s2">once reviewed by this guy named Jeffrey</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.600" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">gray Jeffrey gray wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.490" end="00:28:02.660" style="s2">the neural psychology of anxiety man and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:04.820" style="s2">that is a great book it is impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.660" end="00:28:07.670" style="s2">read it took me really it took me like</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.820" end="00:28:10.700" style="s2">six months to read it and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.670" end="00:28:13.429" style="s2">that is that he reviewed about 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:16.910" style="s2">papers and they&#39;re all neurological</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.429" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">papers and and and heavy psychological /</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.910" end="00:28:21.470" style="s2">biological papers he actually read them</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:23.480" style="s2">all and he understood them and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.470" end="00:28:26.510" style="s2">synthesized them and then he wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.480" end="00:28:28.280" style="s2">book about the synthesis and so and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.510" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">very very careful with this terminology</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.280" end="00:28:31.880" style="s2">and so to read the book you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.370" style="s2">understand brain anatomy and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.880" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">understand neural neural pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.370" end="00:28:38.660" style="s2">and you have to end understand animal</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:42.290" style="s2">behavior the whole literature on animal</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.660" end="00:28:44.210" style="s2">behavior not whole whopping dose of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.290" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">human psychology and cybernetics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.210" end="00:28:49.010" style="s2">like it&#39;s a vicious book but you really</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:51.320" style="s2">learn something when you read it if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.010" end="00:28:53.300" style="s2">go through it it by bit like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.320" end="00:28:55.429" style="s2">it&#39;s had an overwhelming influence on</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.300" end="00:28:57.050" style="s2">psychology even among people who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.429" end="00:29:00.620" style="s2">read it which is most of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.050" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">cite it by the way and so but he said he</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.620" end="00:29:04.070" style="s2">outlined this real cool study maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:05.750" style="s2">was a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.070" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">is about how to motivate rats you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.750" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">and rats are a lot like us you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:15.220" style="s2">positive and negative ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:17.570" style="s2">and you know biochemically and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.220" end="00:29:19.220" style="s2">psycho pharmacologically they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:21.770" style="s2">very similar and they have very complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.220" end="00:29:23.300" style="s2">social environments and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.770" end="00:29:25.490" style="s2">have hierarchies and they play and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.300" end="00:29:27.110" style="s2">laugh Jack panksepp Jaak panksepp found</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.490" end="00:29:28.430" style="s2">out that routes laugh if you tickle them</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.110" end="00:29:30.350" style="s2">you can tickle them with like the end of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.430" end="00:29:31.550" style="s2">a pencil eraser but you can&#39;t hear them</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.350" end="00:29:34.040" style="s2">laughing because they laugh</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.550" end="00:29:35.420" style="s2">ultrasonically like bats so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.040" end="00:29:36.620" style="s2">record it and then slow it down then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.420" end="00:29:39.590" style="s2">can hear them giggling away when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.620" end="00:29:42.200" style="s2">tickle em so so which is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.590" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">think oh you know spend $50,000 on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.200" end="00:29:46.100" style="s2">study demonstrating that rats laugh and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">you think well wait a second wait a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.100" end="00:29:49.970" style="s2">second that&#39;s a major-league study you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:51.740" style="s2">know because he&#39;s outlined a ludic</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.970" end="00:29:54.110" style="s2">circuit that&#39;s a play circuit and yock</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.740" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">banks have discovered the play circuited</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.110" end="00:29:58.430" style="s2">mammals that&#39;s a bloody big deal you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">know if you get that by like rubbing</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.430" end="00:30:00.410" style="s2">rats with a pencil eraser well good for</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:05.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.410" end="00:30:08.540" style="s2">so anyways so Great Auk Talaat about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.000" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">to motivate a a rat and you might have</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.540" end="00:30:11.990" style="s2">heard about BF Skinner you know he used</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.220" end="00:30:13.340" style="s2">food pellets to motivate his rats but</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.990" end="00:30:14.930" style="s2">what you don&#39;t know about Skinner is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.340" end="00:30:16.370" style="s2">that those rats were starved to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.930" end="00:30:19.490" style="s2">three-quarters of their normal body</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.370" end="00:30:22.550" style="s2">weight so they would they would work for</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.490" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2">food and so Skinner&#39;s routes were kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.550" end="00:30:26.390" style="s2">of oversimplified but you can get rats</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:27.740" style="s2">to work for food they don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.390" end="00:30:28.910" style="s2">that hungry you can get them to work for</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.740" end="00:30:30.860" style="s2">food and they&#39;ll do all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.910" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">they&#39;ll press levers and and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.860" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">open our open doors and they&#39;ll solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">problems and you know they&#39;ll do all</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:40.070" style="s2">sorts of things and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.780" style="s2">you can do to kind of measure how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.070" end="00:30:43.040" style="s2">the rat is motivated is let&#39;s say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.780" end="00:30:44.930" style="s2">read him through a maze and he knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.040" end="00:30:47.810" style="s2">there&#39;s some food at the end of the maze</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.930" end="00:30:49.970" style="s2">you can tie a little spring to his tail</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.810" end="00:30:51.560" style="s2">and see how hard he pulls when you open</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:53.420" style="s2">the door to the maze so that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.560" end="00:30:55.160" style="s2">that&#39;s how much rat work the route is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.420" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">willing to do so you can measure that or</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.160" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">you can see how fast these skitters down</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:01.460" style="s2">the maze and you can get an estimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">about the rats motivation and so then</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.460" end="00:31:05.630" style="s2">you might say well how motivated is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.590" end="00:31:07.820" style="s2">hungry rat and the answer would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.630" end="00:31:10.670" style="s2">depends on how hungry is but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.820" end="00:31:12.230" style="s2">another answer it also depends on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.670" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">chasing him when he&#39;s going after the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.230" end="00:31:17.480" style="s2">food so if you have a rat and you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:20.299" style="s2">have food over here and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.480" end="00:31:22.850" style="s2">often some cat odor rats hate cat odor</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.299" end="00:31:25.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s innate they never have to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.850" end="00:31:27.650" style="s2">or smell a cat to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.160" end="00:31:29.900" style="s2">petrified by cat odor and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.650" end="00:31:31.520" style="s2">walked in some cat odor and then open</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.900" end="00:31:33.140" style="s2">the door that rat will zoom to that food</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.520" end="00:31:33.620" style="s2">a lot faster than it will if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.140" end="00:31:35.870" style="s2">hungry</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.620" end="00:31:37.940" style="s2">so a rat running away from something</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.870" end="00:31:39.980" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t want towards something</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.940" end="00:31:42.919" style="s2">that it does want is a very motivated</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:44.270" style="s2">rat and so one of the things we did with</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.919" end="00:31:46.280" style="s2">the future authoring program that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.270" end="00:31:47.660" style="s2">germane to this idea of terror because</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.280" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a business idea in the old</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.660" end="00:31:50.929" style="s2">testament the fear of God is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">beginning of wisdom and it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.929" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">harsh idea but but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:57.110" style="s2">really useful about it because one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">the things you see with people all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.110" end="00:32:01.309" style="s2">time is that they&#39;re maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">trying to stumble forward towards their</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.309" end="00:32:06.440" style="s2">ideal as poorly defined as it might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:07.700" style="s2">but then they&#39;re afraid right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.440" end="00:32:10.280" style="s2">afraid about what they might encounter</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.700" end="00:32:11.960" style="s2">and that stops them because fear does</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.280" end="00:32:14.210" style="s2">stop people it freezes you like a prey</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.960" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">animal and so people move ahead but then</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.210" end="00:32:18.710" style="s2">they get afraid and then they start</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:20.090" style="s2">moving ahead and so and that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.710" end="00:32:21.980" style="s2">good because negative emotion is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.090" end="00:32:23.600" style="s2">really powerful motivator so we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.980" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">motivated by negative emotion than</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:28.280" style="s2">positive emotion quantitatively speaking</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:29.780" style="s2">quantitative quantitatively speaking you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.280" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">can measure that and that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.780" end="00:32:33.650" style="s2">because we can only be so happy but we</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:36.049" style="s2">can really be suffering and yet you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.650" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">so we have to pay more attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.049" end="00:32:39.470" style="s2">negative and that&#39;s bad because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:42.830" style="s2">negative can stop you and then in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.470" end="00:32:43.940" style="s2">clinical practice you know I often talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.830" end="00:32:46.520" style="s2">to people who are trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.940" end="00:32:48.290" style="s2">difficult life decision and and they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.520" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">weighing out the costs and the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.290" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">of making the life decision you know and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:53.630" style="s2">one of the things I always talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:56.059" style="s2">about is wait a second that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.630" end="00:32:57.799" style="s2">incomplete analysis you have to weigh</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.059" end="00:33:00.530" style="s2">out the benefits and the costs of doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.799" end="00:33:02.750" style="s2">this and you have to weigh out the costs</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.530" end="00:33:04.940" style="s2">and benefits of not doing that not doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.750" end="00:33:06.620" style="s2">it and that&#39;s not the same as the zero</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.940" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">that you assume that you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.620" end="00:33:11.510" style="s2">with right because to not make a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:13.160" style="s2">decision it also has a cost and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.510" end="00:33:15.140" style="s2">sometimes the cost of not making a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.160" end="00:33:17.270" style="s2">decision is far worse than the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.140" end="00:33:19.250" style="s2">making a decision even if the decision</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.270" end="00:33:20.570" style="s2">is risky and so one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.250" end="00:33:24.679" style="s2">can derive from that and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.570" end="00:33:26.450" style="s2">useful I think is that this is also I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.679" end="00:33:28.520" style="s2">think why it&#39;s so useful to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.450" end="00:33:30.410" style="s2">your mortality so to speak as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.520" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">screwed no matter what you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.410" end="00:33:35.300" style="s2">you know and that actually frees you is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:36.950" style="s2">that you you you have power fade that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.300" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">has catastrophes and you have path B</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.950" end="00:33:41.000" style="s2">that has catastrophes and you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:43.190" style="s2">to have the no catastrophe path but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.000" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">get to pick which one and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.190" end="00:33:47.660" style="s2">something because if you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:49.490" style="s2">there&#39;s terrible risk associated with</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.660" end="00:33:50.780" style="s2">everything that you do and don&#39;t do then</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.490" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">you can afford to take some risks</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.780" end="00:33:55.670" style="s2">because you&#39;re not you know this is all</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:58.160" style="s2">within the arc metaphor I&#39;m still making</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.670" end="00:34:00.860" style="s2">the case that despite the fact that your</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.160" end="00:34:02.840" style="s2">life is essentially catastrophic you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:04.580" style="s2">you can make a covenant with the highest</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.840" end="00:34:06.710" style="s2">ideal and that will take you through it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.580" end="00:34:11.929" style="s2">the best way possible and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.710" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">making that case so so then you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.929" end="00:34:14.540" style="s2">okay while I&#39;m trying to make this</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">decision I&#39;m gonna go try to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.540" end="00:34:17.630" style="s2">something difficult and isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:18.190" style="s2">terrifying and then you think yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.630" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.190" end="00:34:24.350" style="s2">what&#39;s really terrifying is not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:25.820" style="s2">and then you think about the cost of not</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.350" end="00:34:27.650" style="s2">doing it so in the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.820" end="00:34:29.330" style="s2">program we have people do this little</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.650" end="00:34:32.419" style="s2">meditative exercise which is okay just</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.330" end="00:34:34.070" style="s2">think about your insufficiencies by your</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.419" end="00:34:36.610" style="s2">own definition right the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.070" end="00:34:38.990" style="s2">don&#39;t do what you know you should do</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.610" end="00:34:40.550" style="s2">about the things that you do that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.990" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do that you know you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.550" end="00:34:44.540" style="s2">do beyond a shadow of a doubt right</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:47.090" style="s2">there&#39;s some things like that and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.540" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">that&#39;s bad habits and poor aim and all</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.090" end="00:34:51.140" style="s2">of the resentment and hatred and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:53.450" style="s2">aggression and unresolved conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.140" end="00:34:54.740" style="s2">all those things that are demanding you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.450" end="00:34:56.840" style="s2">and warping you and then think okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.740" end="00:34:58.550" style="s2">those things get the upper hand man they</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.840" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">get the upper hand and they take you the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.550" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">worst possible place you could go in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:05.270" style="s2">next three to five years what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">does that look like and so you sketch</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.270" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">all that out and you think hey I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:10.490" style="s2">want to go there and so the next time</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:11.780" style="s2">that a temptation comes up you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.490" end="00:35:13.400" style="s2">well I&#39;d be a lot better for me if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.780" end="00:35:14.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t succumb to this temptation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.400" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">like that&#39;s kind of weak eh</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.810" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">you&#39;d look a little better if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:20.330" style="s2">eat like a cheesecake a day or something</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:23.300" style="s2">like that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.330" end="00:35:25.250" style="s2">something but it&#39;s not the same as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.300" end="00:35:27.800" style="s2">gonna have diabeetus and I&#39;m gonna lose</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.250" end="00:35:29.600" style="s2">my damn leg in in in five years if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.800" end="00:35:31.430" style="s2">don&#39;t get my eating under control that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.600" end="00:35:34.790" style="s2">motivating and so then the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.430" end="00:35:37.880" style="s2">comes along and you think oh how about</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.790" end="00:35:41.090" style="s2">no seriously how about no not just</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.880" end="00:35:43.910" style="s2">because a higher good would be obtained</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.090" end="00:35:45.859" style="s2">if I avoided it but because a</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.859" end="00:35:51.319" style="s2">I didn&#39;t and so well so you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.890" end="00:35:52.789" style="s2">your fear behind you right you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.319" end="00:35:54.319" style="s2">get it behind you where it&#39;s pushing you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.789" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">forward instead of in front of you where</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.319" end="00:35:58.190" style="s2">it&#39;s stopping you and you get your fear</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.190" end="00:36:02.359" style="s2">by actually thinking through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.260" end="00:36:04.130" style="s2">consequences of not putting your life</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.359" end="00:36:05.990" style="s2">together and the least of those is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.130" end="00:36:07.549" style="s2">you waste it and suffer right because</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.990" end="00:36:10.579" style="s2">you can suffer anyways man</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.549" end="00:36:12.619" style="s2">so you waste it and suffer that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.579" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">deal because maybe if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.619" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">suffer you could at least do something</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:19.069" style="s2">noble and glorious and upright and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:22.220" style="s2">powerful and honorable and admirable and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.069" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">helpful and difficult you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.220" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">just so much better and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:28.220" style="s2">good enough so that you think hey you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:28.910" style="s2">know little suffering it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.220" end="00:36:31.970" style="s2">worth it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.910" end="00:36:37.069" style="s2">at least it&#39;s up WayForward you know at</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.970" end="00:36:39.020" style="s2">least it&#39;s a way forward and he said</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.020" end="00:36:42.740" style="s2">seed shall be a stranger in the land</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.740" end="00:36:45.530" style="s2">people and nail flicked them for four</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.530" end="00:36:49.400" style="s2">go ahead he&#39;s hedging his bets here a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.270" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">lot right he says to Abraham well go out</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.400" end="00:36:52.369" style="s2">you know into the world and then he</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:53.750" style="s2">confronts him with a famine and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.369" end="00:36:55.339" style="s2">confronts him with the tyranny and with</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.750" end="00:36:57.589" style="s2">powerful people he wants to take his</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.339" end="00:36:59.270" style="s2">wife and then he loses his nephew and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.589" end="00:37:02.109" style="s2">who he has a fight with many has to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.270" end="00:37:04.220" style="s2">fight a war and now he you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.109" end="00:37:08.270" style="s2">reconstituting this covenant god says</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.220" end="00:37:09.980" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re gonna have mmm a nation is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.270" end="00:37:11.869" style="s2">going to come from you but they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.980" end="00:37:15.740" style="s2">be slaves to tyrants for like four</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.869" end="00:37:18.589" style="s2">hundred years is it&#39;s like he&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.740" end="00:37:20.299" style="s2">great salesman exactly but but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.589" end="00:37:22.069" style="s2">about it is that the thing that I like</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.299" end="00:37:25.579" style="s2">about it is that it&#39;s realistic you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.069" end="00:37:28.849" style="s2">and you ought to think too because who</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.579" end="00:37:30.799" style="s2">knows why it is that the Bible exists or</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.849" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">why people wrote it but you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.799" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna sell you something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.910" style="s2">know if this is the way to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:39.319" style="s2">know because unless you&#39;re a Salesman</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.910" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">who&#39;s sophisticated beyond belief</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.319" end="00:37:42.829" style="s2">because you&#39;d think that if it was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.359" style="s2">a matter of controlling the masses let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.829" end="00:37:45.890" style="s2">say which is once a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.359" end="00:37:48.039" style="s2">interpretation of religion or or</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.890" end="00:37:50.690" style="s2">providing people with a primitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.039" end="00:37:51.770" style="s2">defense against death anxiety which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.690" end="00:37:53.990" style="s2">essentially the Freudian interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.770" end="00:37:55.910" style="s2">that you&#39;d kind of make the deals that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.990" end="00:37:57.870" style="s2">God cut with Abraham a little more on</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.910" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2">the positive and polished side</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.870" end="00:38:02.700" style="s2">instead of making them a realistic offer</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.210" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">constantly like they are that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.700" end="00:38:06.420" style="s2">also that that that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.610" style="s2">I think it is reasonable to treat the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.420" end="00:38:10.080" style="s2">Bible as literature it&#39;s it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.610" end="00:38:11.730" style="s2">literature it&#39;s something other than</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.080" end="00:38:13.080" style="s2">literature but you can treat it as</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.730" end="00:38:14.340" style="s2">literature and I think the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.080" end="00:38:16.500" style="s2">you can treat it as literature is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.340" end="00:38:18.900" style="s2">because the characters are all complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.500" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">including the character of God Himself</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.900" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">is complex and sophisticated it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:24.930" style="s2">one-sided</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:27.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s paradoxical and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.930" end="00:38:29.100" style="s2">incomprehensible at times but I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.180" end="00:38:30.780" style="s2">good literature is like that because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.100" end="00:38:32.010" style="s2">know true art here&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.780" end="00:38:34.860" style="s2">true art this is something I learned</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.010" end="00:38:38.280" style="s2">from young it&#39;s so smart he was so smart</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.860" end="00:38:40.650" style="s2">so he imagined that you inhabit the land</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.280" end="00:38:42.330" style="s2">that you know conceptually and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.650" end="00:38:44.370" style="s2">practically and then imagine outside of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.330" end="00:38:46.080" style="s2">that there&#39;s that massive space of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.370" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">things that you don&#39;t know and even</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.080" end="00:38:49.890" style="s2">outside of that there&#39;s the space of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.630" style="s2">things that no one knows right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.890" end="00:38:53.490" style="s2">the known territory surrounded by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.630" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">unknown that&#39;s the canonical archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.490" end="00:38:57.900" style="s2">landscape and the unknown manifests</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:38:59.580" style="s2">itself to you and that&#39;s where new</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.900" end="00:39:01.800" style="s2">knowledge comes from but the question is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.580" end="00:39:04.290" style="s2">how is that knowledge generated and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:06.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just leap from completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.290" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">unknown to completely articulate it in</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.420" end="00:39:11.070" style="s2">one move that isn&#39;t how it happens it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:14.430" style="s2">has to pass through stages of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.070" end="00:39:16.080" style="s2">before it becomes articulable and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.430" end="00:39:17.640" style="s2">first stage of analysis as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.080" end="00:39:19.260" style="s2">tell is that you act it out so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.640" end="00:39:21.510" style="s2">something really surprises you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.260" end="00:39:23.100" style="s2">the first way that you react to it your</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.510" end="00:39:24.870" style="s2">category is actually embodied too you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.100" end="00:39:27.270" style="s2">like this that that&#39;s your first</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.870" end="00:39:29.940" style="s2">category it&#39;s not conceptual at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.270" end="00:39:32.700" style="s2">embodied and then maybe you start to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.940" end="00:39:34.020" style="s2">like you&#39;re at home at night and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.700" end="00:39:36.030" style="s2">know something startled seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.020" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">freeze and then it&#39;s dark and then your</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.030" end="00:39:39.720" style="s2">imagination populates the darkness with</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:41.730" style="s2">whatever might be making the noise and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.720" end="00:39:44.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the sequence it&#39;s like embodied</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.730" end="00:39:46.920" style="s2">response imaginative representation</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.330" end="00:39:49.170" style="s2">exploration articulation that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.920" end="00:39:51.360" style="s2">information moves from the unknown to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.170" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">the known and an artists are the people</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.360" end="00:39:55.620" style="s2">who stand on that imagistic frontier and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:58.050" style="s2">they and they put themselves out into</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.620" end="00:39:59.460" style="s2">the unknown and they and they they take</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.050" end="00:40:01.650" style="s2">a piece of it and they and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.460" end="00:40:03.600" style="s2">transform it into some mythological</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.650" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">image and they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:06.660" style="s2">doing exactly because they&#39;re guided by</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.190" style="s2">their intuition if they&#39;re real artists</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.660" end="00:40:10.020" style="s2">otherwise they&#39;re just propagandists</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.190" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">they have to be contending with</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:13.350" style="s2">something they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:15.869" style="s2">and what they do is they make it more</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.350" end="00:40:17.820" style="s2">understandable you know and and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.869" end="00:40:19.560" style="s2">people gaze at those artworks or the or</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.820" end="00:40:20.970" style="s2">they listen to the stories and then they</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.560" end="00:40:24.180" style="s2">start to become informed by them but</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.970" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how or why I was at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.180" end="00:40:28.590" style="s2">Modern Art Museum Museum of Art in New</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.400" end="00:40:31.530" style="s2">York I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.590" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">one unfortunately but I was in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.530" end="00:40:38.130" style="s2">amazing room you know it had all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.240" end="00:40:40.320" style="s2">priceless paintings from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.130" end="00:40:42.390" style="s2">late Renaissance hanging in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.320" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">each painting worth who knows a billion</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.390" end="00:40:47.610" style="s2">dollars maybe they&#39;re priceless bathing</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:49.020" style="s2">so the room was it&#39;s a shrine and it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.610" end="00:40:50.730" style="s2">full of people from all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.020" end="00:40:51.510" style="s2">who are looking at these paintings you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.730" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">think well what the hell are these</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.830" end="00:41:00.840" style="s2">painting of the Assumption of Mary right</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">brilliantly composed and there rose all</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.840" end="00:41:04.230" style="s2">these people looking at it and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:05.850" style="s2">what are they doing they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.230" end="00:41:07.470" style="s2">that means like why are they looking at</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.850" end="00:41:09.240" style="s2">that painting why is it in this room why</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.470" end="00:41:11.130" style="s2">does it cost a billion dollars why is</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.240" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">that painting worth so much and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.130" end="00:41:14.970" style="s2">answer to that is well we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:17.010" style="s2">know like it happened there are there</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.970" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">sacred objects in some sense and we gaze</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.010" end="00:41:21.090" style="s2">at them in ignorance and wonder and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:24.060" style="s2">reason for that is that the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.090" end="00:41:28.340" style="s2">shines through the Madison in partially</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.060" end="00:41:28.340" style="s2">articulated form and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.400" end="00:41:43.630" style="s2">well that&#39;s the role of art and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.330" end="00:41:45.790" style="s2">the role of artists you know real</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.630" end="00:41:47.860" style="s2">artists real artists are contending with</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.790" end="00:41:49.390" style="s2">unknown right and they&#39;re possessed by</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.860" end="00:41:51.160" style="s2">it they have a personality trait</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.390" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">openness that makes them do that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.160" end="00:41:54.610" style="s2">can&#39;t even help it and I&#39;ve had lots of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:57.580" style="s2">creative people in my clinical practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.610" end="00:41:59.320" style="s2">so they can tell you the worst thing for</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.580" end="00:42:01.540" style="s2">creative people is to not be creative</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.320" end="00:42:04.270" style="s2">because they just die and it because</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.540" end="00:42:07.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like maybe you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.270" end="00:42:10.030" style="s2">tree with a few major branches you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.720" end="00:42:11.590" style="s2">that&#39;s your personality so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.030" end="00:42:13.270" style="s2">extroverted man you can&#39;t be cut off</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.590" end="00:42:15.700" style="s2">from people because you just wither and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.270" end="00:42:17.530" style="s2">if you&#39;re agreeable you have to be in an</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.700" end="00:42:19.420" style="s2">intimate relationship or you die you</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.530" end="00:42:21.160" style="s2">know if you&#39;re conscientious man and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.420" end="00:42:22.750" style="s2">get and you&#39;re unemployed you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.160" end="00:42:24.310" style="s2">gonna eat yourself up because you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.750" end="00:42:25.960" style="s2">to have a duty and you have to carry a</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.310" end="00:42:28.000" style="s2">load because you just can&#39;t stand it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.960" end="00:42:29.920" style="s2">otherwise and open people have to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.000" end="00:42:31.480" style="s2">creative they have to be because</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.920" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">otherwise they die they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.480" end="00:42:37.450" style="s2">vitality and so they&#39;re cursed with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:39.160" style="s2">necessity of putting a foot out into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.450" end="00:42:41.380" style="s2">unknown and making sense of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.160" end="00:42:42.460" style="s2">they&#39;re also cursed necessity of trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.380" end="00:42:44.200" style="s2">to make a living while they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.460" end="00:42:45.880" style="s2">that which they can&#39;t because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.200" end="00:42:48.850" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.880" end="00:42:50.470" style="s2">creative creative action as many of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.850" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">who are creative will no doubt find out</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.470" end="00:42:54.970" style="s2">it&#39;s very very frustrating it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.770" style="s2">creative action is were without value</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.970" end="00:42:58.030" style="s2">right because the creative people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.770" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">entrepreneurs and the creative people</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.030" end="00:43:02.050" style="s2">revitalize cities and the creative</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:03.250" style="s2">people make things magnificent and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.050" end="00:43:04.600" style="s2">beautiful you think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.250" end="00:43:06.370" style="s2">happened in Europe over the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.600" end="00:43:10.750" style="s2">thousand years say two thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.370" end="00:43:13.270" style="s2">this amazing unbelievable collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.750" end="00:43:15.460" style="s2">to make things so beautiful that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.270" end="00:43:17.110" style="s2">they&#39;re jaw-dropping when you walk into</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.460" end="00:43:19.030" style="s2">them and you think about the economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.110" end="00:43:20.890" style="s2">value of that right I mean I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.030" end="00:43:22.510" style="s2">it&#39;s either France or Spain that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.890" end="00:43:23.560" style="s2">most visited country in the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.510" end="00:43:25.180" style="s2">one of those two I think there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.560" end="00:43:27.190" style="s2">tourists in France than there are people</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.180" end="00:43:28.900" style="s2">most of the time and part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.190" end="00:43:30.700" style="s2">for that is it&#39;s just so damn beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.900" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">you just can&#39;t stand it and you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.700" end="00:43:36.190" style="s2">what&#39;s the economic value of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:38.350" style="s2">absolutely incalculable and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.190" end="00:43:40.690" style="s2">interesting too is that you build that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.350" end="00:43:43.660" style="s2">beauty in and then the farther away you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.690" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">get from it in time the more valuable it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.660" end="00:43:47.080" style="s2">becomes right instead of decaying it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.510" style="s2">exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.080" end="00:43:51.550" style="s2">it&#39;s value magnifies and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.510" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">things that I&#39;m deeply ashamed of as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.550" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">Canadian is that our sense of beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:58.810" style="s2">so underdeveloped we&#39;re so primitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:02.610" style="s2">it&#39;s not even primitive that&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.810" end="00:44:06.430" style="s2">word because you know I don&#39;t what it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.610" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s second rate it&#39;s second</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.430" end="00:44:10.600" style="s2">rate at least it&#39;s terrorto because</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:13.150" style="s2">people are afraid of beauty but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.600" end="00:44:14.500" style="s2">that art is the conservatives really</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.150" end="00:44:16.360" style="s2">have a problem with this in particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.500" end="00:44:18.690" style="s2">because conservative people tend not to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.360" end="00:44:21.970" style="s2">be that creative and it&#39;s a misty</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.690" end="00:44:23.470" style="s2">restaurant it&#39;s a mystery to me because</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.970" end="00:44:25.300" style="s2">they should be concerned with economic</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.470" end="00:44:27.310" style="s2">development and beauty is so</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.300" end="00:44:29.140" style="s2">unbelievably crucial to economic</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.310" end="00:44:32.200" style="s2">development it just yells out at you you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.140" end="00:44:33.460" style="s2">know so anyway so that&#39;s what artists</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.200" end="00:44:35.470" style="s2">are doing and so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.460" end="00:44:37.510" style="s2">would say is buy a damn piece of art you</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.470" end="00:44:39.280" style="s2">know find one that really speaks to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.510" end="00:44:41.230" style="s2">and and buy a piece of art because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.280" end="00:44:44.080" style="s2">invite that into your life and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.230" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">a look-out if you do it if it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.080" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">piece of art because you&#39;ll also get a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:48.730" style="s2">you know a little introduction to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:50.890" style="s2">artist and then that&#39;ll seep into your</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.730" end="00:44:53.410" style="s2">life and that&#39;ll change things like mad</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.890" end="00:44:56.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s really it&#39;s unbelievably worth</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.410" end="00:44:58.300" style="s2">it because it it opens your eyes to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:44:59.800" style="s2">domain of the transcendent that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.300" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">right way of thinking about a real piece</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.800" end="00:45:04.450" style="s2">of art is a window into the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:06.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is and you need that in</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.450" end="00:45:08.860" style="s2">your life because you&#39;re finite and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.100" end="00:45:10.540" style="s2">limited and bounded right by your</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.860" end="00:45:12.610" style="s2">ignorance and your lack of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.540" end="00:45:14.170" style="s2">unless you can make a connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.610" end="00:45:16.060" style="s2">transcendent then you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.170" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">strength to prevail and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.060" end="00:45:19.990" style="s2">the Covenant that&#39;s part of the covenant</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">with God and you can see that because</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:25.000" style="s2">you look at these magnificent cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:26.770" style="s2">that our civilization built over the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.000" end="00:45:29.350" style="s2">centuries you know some of those they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.770" end="00:45:33.010" style="s2">still building this Sangre de Familia in</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.350" end="00:45:34.540" style="s2">in in Barcelona right and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.010" end="00:45:37.060" style="s2">amazing building I think it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.540" end="00:45:38.650" style="s2">them like 300 years to build that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.060" end="00:45:40.060" style="s2">know people in the Middle Ages they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.650" end="00:45:41.950" style="s2">start building a cathedral and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.060" end="00:45:44.200" style="s2">think yeah we&#39;ll be done this in 300</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.950" end="00:45:45.880" style="s2">years you know you imagine the vision</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.200" end="00:45:48.850" style="s2">that it took to invest in something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.880" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">that we look at quarterly reports we</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.850" end="00:45:52.900" style="s2">can&#39;t think 300 years into the future to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:56.170" style="s2">build something of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.900" end="00:45:57.790" style="s2">remarkable remarkable what those</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.170" end="00:45:59.860" style="s2">cathedrals are so they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.790" end="00:46:00.610" style="s2">perfect they&#39;re trees first right</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.860" end="00:46:02.170" style="s2">they&#39;re a forest</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.610" end="00:46:03.580" style="s2">right the Gothic cathedrals there they</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.170" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">were forced and the sun is shining</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.580" end="00:46:06.610" style="s2">through the branches</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the stained glass and they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.610" end="00:46:10.780" style="s2">perfect balance of light and structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.950" end="00:46:12.430" style="s2">because they&#39;re representing something</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.780" end="00:46:14.500" style="s2">about the proper structure of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.430" end="00:46:16.330" style="s2">which is something like the proper</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.500" end="00:46:19.260" style="s2">balance between light and structure and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.330" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">and they represent like the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.260" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">tragedy of mankind that&#39;s why they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:25.840" style="s2">the shape of a cross and they&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:28.210" style="s2">the sky that&#39;s why they have a dome and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.840" end="00:46:30.100" style="s2">they&#39;re full of gold so that glitters</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.210" end="00:46:34.500" style="s2">because that&#39;s like the City of God you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.100" end="00:46:37.840" style="s2">know and and and you you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.500" end="00:46:40.750" style="s2">that integral to to our culture is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.840" end="00:46:43.150" style="s2">idea that beauty is one pathway towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:45.130" style="s2">God and it&#39;s in its saying if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.150" end="00:46:47.080" style="s2">find another pathway then why don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.130" end="00:46:48.970" style="s2">beauty I sure most of you do that with</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.080" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">music because music is the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.970" end="00:46:52.900" style="s2">that modern people can&#39;t be cynical</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:54.910" style="s2">about thank God for that and being</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.900" end="00:46:57.340" style="s2">fascinated by music because of that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.910" end="00:46:59.830" style="s2">it speaks meaning to people right even</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.340" end="00:47:01.600" style="s2">nihilistic punk rockers are so damn</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.830" end="00:47:03.460" style="s2">engaged with their music that they can</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.600" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">hardly stand it and you can knock on</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.460" end="00:47:07.390" style="s2">them and say look you know you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:08.500" style="s2">a transcendent religious experience and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.390" end="00:47:11.340" style="s2">they&#39;ll just tell you to off</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.500" end="00:47:11.340" style="s2">because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:20.030" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.800" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s that&#39;s what punk rock</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.030" end="00:47:25.430" style="s2">yourself to do but but that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:30.890" style="s2">what&#39;s happening you know I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.430" end="00:47:32.990" style="s2">still what&#39;s happening so okay so okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.890" end="00:47:34.940" style="s2">so I got into all that because I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.990" end="00:47:36.650" style="s2">talking about about the Bible as</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.940" end="00:47:40.310" style="s2">literature you know and and and trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.650" end="00:47:44.120" style="s2">to and trying to lay out because we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.310" end="00:47:45.790" style="s2">in our culture to justify the arts and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.120" end="00:47:48.320" style="s2">you have to I don&#39;t want to do that by</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.790" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">talking about high culture talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.320" end="00:47:52.070" style="s2">something abstract and evanescent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:54.590" style="s2">the wrong way to go about it this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.070" end="00:47:55.850" style="s2">vital you know like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.590" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.850" end="00:48:00.110" style="s2">University of Toronto is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:03.620" style="s2">one side of the campus where we are is</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.110" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">beautiful medieval cathedral and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.620" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">other side is god-awful factory and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:12.310" style="s2">know and and that and the thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:14.450" style="s2">attitude towards knowledge has</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.310" end="00:48:17.210" style="s2">paralleled that architectural</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.450" end="00:48:19.070" style="s2">transformation you know at one point the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.210" end="00:48:21.530" style="s2">humanities let&#39;s say we&#39;re a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.070" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">endeavor and and so was the art of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.530" end="00:48:26.030" style="s2">educated in the university and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">turned into like mass factory and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.030" end="00:48:30.080" style="s2">reflected in the architecture this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:32.270" style="s2">accidental none of this happens none of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.080" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">this happens by random chance you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.270" end="00:48:36.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a conspiracy or</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">anything because there isn&#39;t but that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.380" end="00:48:39.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:41.660" style="s2">tangled together and the loss of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.530" end="00:48:44.690" style="s2">in the universities is a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.660" end="00:48:47.330" style="s2">because without that beauty there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.690" end="00:48:50.060" style="s2">call to higher being you know you this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.330" end="00:48:51.470" style="s2">is also why I&#39;ve mentioned to people</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.060" end="00:48:53.630" style="s2">that they should clean up their rooms</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.470" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s become quite the internet meme</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.630" end="00:48:56.690" style="s2">but I&#39;m really serious about it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:58.310" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to do that and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.690" end="00:49:00.530" style="s2">been cleaning up my room by the way for</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.310" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">about four months now because my life</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.530" end="00:49:04.760" style="s2">was thrown into such a catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:07.010" style="s2">and also we were renovating and so but</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.760" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just that you clean it up you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.010" end="00:49:11.990" style="s2">also make it beautiful and beauty hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.340" style="s2">to make something beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.990" end="00:49:14.750" style="s2">really worthwhile and what&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.340" end="00:49:16.460" style="s2">is if you learn to make something</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.750" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">beautiful even one thing if you can just</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.460" end="00:49:20.090" style="s2">make one thing in your life beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:22.310" style="s2">then you&#39;ve established a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.090" end="00:49:25.010" style="s2">with beauty and then you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.310" end="00:49:27.230" style="s2">expand that relationship with beauty out</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.010" end="00:49:28.280" style="s2">into into the world like into other</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.230" end="00:49:30.190" style="s2">elements of your life</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.280" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">and that is so worthwhile it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.190" end="00:49:35.420" style="s2">incredibly crazily worthwhile and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:37.220" style="s2">an invitation to the divine you know you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.420" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">have to be daring to do that and people</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.220" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">are terrified of it people are terrified</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.100" style="s2">of color they paint their walls beige</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:44.840" style="s2">they&#39;re terrified of art they buy some</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.100" end="00:49:46.730" style="s2">mass-produced thing because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.840" end="00:49:48.590" style="s2">want anybody laughing at them for their</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.730" end="00:49:50.390" style="s2">lack of taste and they would get laughed</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.590" end="00:49:52.340" style="s2">at because they have no taste but you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.390" end="00:49:54.350" style="s2">have to well that&#39;s right because what</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.340" end="00:49:55.730" style="s2">do you know right you have to develop it</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.350" end="00:49:57.620" style="s2">and so you&#39;re gonna stumble along and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.730" end="00:49:59.120" style="s2">make mistakes to begin with and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.620" end="00:50:00.770" style="s2">gonna show yourself because if you buy</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.120" end="00:50:01.910" style="s2">who I I think this is pretty and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.770" end="00:50:04.340" style="s2">know somebody comes over he goes hey</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.910" end="00:50:06.710" style="s2">what&#39;s up with you it&#39;s kind of hard on</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.340" end="00:50:08.390" style="s2">yourself esteem but but it&#39;s a stunt</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.710" end="00:50:12.350" style="s2">you&#39;re stumbling towards the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.390" end="00:50:14.150" style="s2">you&#39;re stumbling towards the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.350" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">God that&#39;s what you&#39;re stumbling towards</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.150" end="00:50:16.970" style="s2">when you try to make an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:18.140" style="s2">decision and to put something in your</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.970" end="00:50:21.080" style="s2">life that&#39;s beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.140" end="00:50:22.580" style="s2">unbelievably worthwhile to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.080" end="00:50:24.380" style="s2">you have to steer clear of the frauds</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.580" end="00:50:26.210" style="s2">and the con artists and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.380" end="00:50:28.010" style="s2">art is full of that of course because</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.210" end="00:50:30.500" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">the real thing and the fraud but but</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.500" end="00:50:35.090" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievably worthwhile and so back</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:36.680" style="s2">to literature I&#39;m telling you this</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.090" end="00:50:41.050" style="s2">partly because I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.680" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">about the humanities and the arts and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.050" end="00:50:46.280" style="s2">practically speaking because I know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.750" style="s2">artistic types are also entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.280" end="00:50:50.030" style="s2">types they&#39;re the same personality types</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.750" end="00:50:52.280" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very much worthwhile to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.030" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">an economic and practical case for this</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.280" end="00:50:56.090" style="s2">sort of thing you study literature in</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:58.790" style="s2">the humanities so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.090" end="00:51:00.740" style="s2">familiarize yourself with the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.790" end="00:51:02.120" style="s2">our civilization man you should do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.740" end="00:51:04.190" style="s2">because people have been working on this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.120" end="00:51:06.590" style="s2">thing for a long time and it&#39;s rich</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.190" end="00:51:08.900" style="s2">beyond comparison so why wouldn&#39;t you do</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.590" end="00:51:11.540" style="s2">that and you teach yourself to to read</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.900" end="00:51:13.010" style="s2">and you teach yourself to speak and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.540" end="00:51:14.540" style="s2">teach yourself to think and you teach</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.010" end="00:51:17.590" style="s2">yourself to communicate and I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.540" end="00:51:21.940" style="s2">you if you can read and think and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.590" end="00:51:24.530" style="s2">communicate you are absolutely 100%</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.940" end="00:51:26.210" style="s2">unstoppable and that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.530" end="00:51:27.500" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting about humanities</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.210" end="00:51:29.120" style="s2">education that&#39;s at the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.500" end="00:51:30.650" style="s2">university it&#39;s like there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.120" end="00:51:32.540" style="s2">more economically valuable than teaching</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.650" end="00:51:34.070" style="s2">people how to articulate themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.540" end="00:51:35.870" style="s2">communicate because they can identify</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.070" end="00:51:37.940" style="s2">problems they can formulate solutions</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.870" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">they can negotiate to consensus they</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.940" end="00:51:42.380" style="s2">they can negotiate on their own behalf</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:45.470" style="s2">on the behalf of others it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.380" end="00:51:47.000" style="s2">absolutely no downside to it except that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.470" end="00:51:49.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a responsibility that goes along</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.000" end="00:51:51.950" style="s2">with it but it doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.330" end="00:51:54.050" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape from responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.950" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">you can either take it voluntarily or</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.050" end="00:51:56.810" style="s2">you can take it involuntarily those are</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:51:59.690" style="s2">your options but there aren&#39;t any other</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.810" end="00:52:01.580" style="s2">options and so we need to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.690" end="00:52:03.380" style="s2">role of art and literature and and stop</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.580" end="00:52:05.870" style="s2">thinking about it as an option it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.380" end="00:52:07.670" style="s2">an option it&#39;s not an option what is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.870" end="00:52:09.410" style="s2">said man does not live by bread alone</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.670" end="00:52:11.660" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.410" end="00:52:14.120" style="s2">we live by beauty we live by literature</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.660" end="00:52:16.430" style="s2">we live by art and literally not</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.120" end="00:52:18.680" style="s2">metaphorically we cannot live without it</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.430" end="00:52:22.790" style="s2">because life is too dismal and and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.680" end="00:52:25.250" style="s2">tragic in the absence of the sublime so</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:27.530" style="s2">and ourselves we have to be sharp so</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.250" end="00:52:29.210" style="s2">that we can survive properly and orient</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.530" end="00:52:33.370" style="s2">the world properly and not destroy</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.210" end="00:52:35.750" style="s2">things including ourselves and so and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.370" end="00:52:38.300" style="s2">back to the Bible which I do think is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.750" end="00:52:39.770" style="s2">reasonable it&#39;s reasonably construed as</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.300" end="00:52:41.570" style="s2">a piece of literature because it&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.770" end="00:52:43.940" style="s2">and because the people who wrote it had</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.570" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">at least one foot in the unknowable and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.940" end="00:52:48.350" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to communicate what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:50.420" style="s2">experienced in the unknowable to make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.350" end="00:52:52.370" style="s2">known and that&#39;s partly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.420" end="00:52:53.660" style="s2">trying to do in this series and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.370" end="00:52:55.940" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.660" end="00:52:59.120" style="s2">listening and all of that and so good</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.940" end="00:53:01.160" style="s2">for that and also that nation whom they</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.120" end="00:53:02.780" style="s2">shall serve I will judge and afterward</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.160" end="00:53:05.060" style="s2">they&#39;ll come out with great substance</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.780" end="00:53:06.860" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a period of tyranny you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.060" end="00:53:08.420" style="s2">and there&#39;s a psychological truth to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.860" end="00:53:10.550" style="s2">that too one of the things I learned</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.420" end="00:53:11.900" style="s2">from reading Nietzsche because you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.550" end="00:53:14.360" style="s2">learn a lot from reading Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.900" end="00:53:15.650" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure he he talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.360" end="00:53:17.300" style="s2">Catholic Church you know Nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.650" end="00:53:18.950" style="s2">often construed as a great critic of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.300" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">Christianity and and he certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.950" end="00:53:24.140" style="s2">but he was no casual critic in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">think he was this sort of critic that</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.140" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;d like to have as a friend</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:29.510" style="s2">because he was the sort of critic that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:31.400" style="s2">said well here&#39;s the great things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.510" end="00:53:32.780" style="s2">done and that you could keep doing but</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.400" end="00:53:34.730" style="s2">here&#39;s a bunch of really neat things</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.780" end="00:53:37.370" style="s2">that you did that you really should stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.730" end="00:53:39.290" style="s2">doing and he talked about the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.370" end="00:53:41.360" style="s2">Church and he said what the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.290" end="00:53:45.620" style="s2">Church had done to the European mind in</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.360" end="00:53:47.900" style="s2">particular was discipline it so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.620" end="00:53:49.430" style="s2">over a period of a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.900" end="00:53:51.380" style="s2">thirteen hundred years fourteen hundred</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.430" end="00:53:54.110" style="s2">years there was this rule that there was</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.380" end="00:53:55.780" style="s2">a conceptual structure within which you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.110" end="00:53:58.180" style="s2">had to interpret everything</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.780" end="00:54:00.420" style="s2">and what that did was turn the European</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.180" end="00:54:03.400" style="s2">educated you European mind into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.420" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">systematizing cognitive entity and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.400" end="00:54:07.480" style="s2">once that systematizing cognitive entity</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:08.890" style="s2">had been established then it could free</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.480" end="00:54:10.780" style="s2">itself from those underlying</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.890" end="00:54:13.570" style="s2">disciplinary structures and go off and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.780" end="00:54:15.490" style="s2">do such things as produced the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.570" end="00:54:17.590" style="s2">Scientific Revolution for example which</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.490" end="00:54:19.060" style="s2">required incredible systematic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.590" end="00:54:21.490" style="s2">and so Nietzsche had this really</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.060" end="00:54:23.710" style="s2">interesting idea about freedom and he</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.490" end="00:54:25.870" style="s2">believed that slavery was an</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.710" end="00:54:27.700" style="s2">intermediary between the undeveloped</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.870" end="00:54:30.280" style="s2">individual and the free individual that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.700" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">you had to you had to submit yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.280" end="00:54:35.050" style="s2">some intense disciplinary process for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:36.970" style="s2">some period of time in your life before</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.050" end="00:54:38.740" style="s2">you could develop any true freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.970" end="00:54:39.910" style="s2">so you think maybe you want to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.740" end="00:54:41.530" style="s2">play the piano it&#39;s like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.910" end="00:54:42.850" style="s2">gonna be any fun for a really long</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.530" end="00:54:44.590" style="s2">period of time right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.850" end="00:54:45.970" style="s2">really bad at it and there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.590" end="00:54:49.030" style="s2">things you have to memorize and you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.970" end="00:54:50.920" style="s2">to stumble around like a well like an</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.030" end="00:54:52.450" style="s2">amateur and the same thing happens when</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.920" end="00:54:53.860" style="s2">kids learn how to read and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.450" end="00:54:55.090" style="s2">never get past that point and they never</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.860" end="00:54:56.980" style="s2">get to the point where they can enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.090" end="00:54:58.300" style="s2">reading but in order to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.980" end="00:55:00.310" style="s2">together you have to put yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.300" end="00:55:02.950" style="s2">vise and allow yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.310" end="00:55:05.230" style="s2">constricted and mangled even by the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.950" end="00:55:07.600" style="s2">thing that enslaves you but the goal</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.230" end="00:55:09.100" style="s2">should be that as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.600" end="00:55:11.260" style="s2">submitting to the discipline that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.100" end="00:55:12.520" style="s2">become disciplined and then once you</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.260" end="00:55:14.620" style="s2">become disciplined you can emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:16.630" style="s2">the disciplinary structure as someone</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.620" end="00:55:18.300" style="s2">who is free and that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.630" end="00:55:22.690" style="s2">very much worth thinking about as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.300" end="00:55:26.980" style="s2">so that&#39;s Illustrated conceptually in</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.690" end="00:55:30.250" style="s2">this in this piece of literature let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.980" end="00:55:32.050" style="s2">say because what what the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.250" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">meaning of what God tells Abraham is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.050" end="00:55:38.230" style="s2">that all people all people are subject</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:40.510" style="s2">and I mean not equally obviously all</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.230" end="00:55:43.560" style="s2">people are subject to the tyranny that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.510" end="00:55:45.490" style="s2">precedes freedom and that that ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.560" end="00:55:47.170" style="s2">repeated over and over in the old</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.490" end="00:55:48.820" style="s2">testament it comes out most particularly</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.170" end="00:55:50.320" style="s2">in the story of moses right because of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.820" end="00:55:52.420" style="s2">course that&#39;s the story of movement from</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.320" end="00:55:54.700" style="s2">tyranny where do you go from a tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.420" end="00:55:57.430" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolute catastrophe you go from</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.700" end="00:55:59.950" style="s2">materi into the desert you know where</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.430" end="00:56:01.360" style="s2">you starve that&#39;s harsh that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.950" end="00:56:03.700" style="s2">happens in the in the story of Exodus</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.360" end="00:56:06.310" style="s2">and so that&#39;s so interesting too because</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.700" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">what it means is that sometimes if</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.310" end="00:56:09.349" style="s2">you&#39;re going to move uphill the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:11.690" style="s2">thing that happens is you move</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.349" end="00:56:14.329" style="s2">down hill a lot and so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.690" end="00:56:16.309" style="s2">escape from the straights that bind you</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.329" end="00:56:17.720" style="s2">now you&#39;re not going to move forward and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.309" end="00:56:20.180" style="s2">go up you&#39;re gonna move forward and go</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.720" end="00:56:21.739" style="s2">down and that&#39;s another reason this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.180" end="00:56:23.329" style="s2">also something that you talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.739" end="00:56:25.099" style="s2">lot is that you know on the road to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.329" end="00:56:26.479" style="s2">enlightenment you encounter all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.099" end="00:56:28.039" style="s2">things that you don&#39;t want to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.479" end="00:56:30.470" style="s2">first like all the weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.039" end="00:56:32.299" style="s2">yourself all the realizations of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.470" end="00:56:34.190" style="s2">tyranny of the world and the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.299" end="00:56:36.410" style="s2">of nature and all of that and so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.190" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">step out of your encapsulation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.410" end="00:56:40.729" style="s2">ignorant encapsulation and its immediate</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:42.829" style="s2">plummet into something that&#39;s a desert</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.729" end="00:56:43.999" style="s2">let&#39;s say where everything is chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.829" end="00:56:46.700" style="s2">and where you&#39;re wandering around</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.999" end="00:56:48.470" style="s2">without direction a real catastrophe so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.700" end="00:56:49.999" style="s2">it&#39;s you know because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.470" end="00:56:52.519" style="s2">you might ask yourself is that if</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.999" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">enlightenment is possible then why</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.519" end="00:56:55.970" style="s2">aren&#39;t people enlightened because if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:57.710" style="s2">was just a matter of going from a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.970" end="00:56:59.690" style="s2">place to a better place it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.710" end="00:57:00.680" style="s2">man let&#39;s just get at it it&#39;s no it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.690" end="00:57:03.650" style="s2">problem right</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.680" end="00:57:05.539" style="s2">why would we ever stop doing that but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.650" end="00:57:06.859" style="s2">seems not to be that it&#39;s that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.539" end="00:57:08.539" style="s2">here and that&#39;s not good and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.859" end="00:57:11.450" style="s2">unstable and you step out of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.539" end="00:57:13.339" style="s2">like down down to where you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.450" end="00:57:14.569" style="s2">to be and you have to contend with that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.339" end="00:57:17.059" style="s2">and then maybe you can start your</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.569" end="00:57:19.309" style="s2">struggle upward and so ever how God is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.059" end="00:57:21.979" style="s2">telling Abraham this and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.309" end="00:57:24.109" style="s2">telling him that it&#39;s okay it&#39;s rough</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.979" end="00:57:25.910" style="s2">though and now and now shall go to thy</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.910" end="00:57:29.989" style="s2">a good old age but in the fourth</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.910" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">reasons that we don&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.749" end="00:57:51.589" style="s2">and it came to pass that when the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.309" end="00:57:53.150" style="s2">went down it was dark behold a smoking</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.589" end="00:57:55.819" style="s2">furnace and a burning lamp that passed</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.829" end="00:58:01.130" style="s2">symbolized the smoke of destruction</p>

<p begin="00:59:07.250" end="00:59:10.010" style="s2">descendants were obviously thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.600" end="00:59:11.410" style="s2">about existence in a way that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.010" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">just focused on their immediate</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.410" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">existence right they were thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:16.820" style="s2">well their children in the grandchildren</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.010" style="s2">maybe their great-grandchildren maybe</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.010" end="00:59:22.550" style="s2">from them and that&#39;s that&#39;s smart you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.260" end="00:59:25.640" style="s2">know one of the things I learned from</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.550" end="00:59:27.590" style="s2">Piaget at least in part was that his</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.640" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">idea of the equilibrated state which he</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.590" end="00:59:32.210" style="s2">thought about as partly part of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">biological basis of the idea of moral</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.210" end="00:59:35.990" style="s2">progress it&#39;s something like that he was</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:38.600" style="s2">a very very smart Piaget and we said</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.990" end="00:59:40.610" style="s2">that the the proper equilibrated state</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.600" end="00:59:42.140" style="s2">is one where imagine you have a family</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.610" end="00:59:43.460" style="s2">you&#39;ve got five people in it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.140" end="00:59:45.110" style="s2">doing what you want and you&#39;re in your</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.460" end="00:59:46.700" style="s2">family what&#39;s good for you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.110" end="00:59:48.860" style="s2">doing it in such a way so that the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.700" end="00:59:51.290" style="s2">four members of your family agree with</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.860" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">what you do and that it also facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.290" end="00:59:54.500" style="s2">them doing what they want and what they</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:56.540" style="s2">should be doing and so it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.500" end="00:59:58.970" style="s2">tricky arrangement because it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.540" end="01:00:00.560" style="s2">for you it&#39;s for you in a way that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.970" end="01:00:01.910" style="s2">them and you could also see that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.560" end="01:00:03.980" style="s2">would be something that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.910" end="01:00:07.580" style="s2">multiplier right because if you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.980" end="01:00:09.740" style="s2">everyone working voluntarily towards the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.580" end="01:00:11.840" style="s2">same common goal then you get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.740" end="01:00:14.060" style="s2">multiplying effect of that and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.840" end="01:00:17.120" style="s2">might think well it&#39;s not just you and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.060" end="01:00:19.370" style="s2">your family it&#39;s you and your family</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.120" end="01:00:21.320" style="s2">today and next week in next month next</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.370" end="01:00:23.000" style="s2">year and ten years from now so you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.320" end="01:00:24.680" style="s2">to take the time span into account and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.000" end="01:00:26.540" style="s2">then it should be you and your family in</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.680" end="01:00:28.310" style="s2">a way that works well in society and</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.540" end="01:00:29.750" style="s2">then it should work well now and next</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.310" end="01:00:31.850" style="s2">week and next year and into the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.750" end="01:00:33.590" style="s2">it should be iterative all right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.850" end="01:00:35.900" style="s2">like sustainability at something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.590" end="01:00:37.080" style="s2">the idea of sustainability and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.900" end="01:00:38.340" style="s2">that&#39;s I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.080" end="01:00:40.980" style="s2">say that&#39;s a reasonable way of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.340" end="01:00:42.300" style="s2">conceptualizing the holy city it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.980" end="01:00:44.430" style="s2">something like that you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.300" end="01:00:46.200" style="s2">trying to make it concrete it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.430" end="01:00:47.340" style="s2">should you live your life well let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.200" end="01:00:49.620" style="s2">you live your life in a manner that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.340" end="01:00:51.990" style="s2">justifies its limitation and tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.620" end="01:00:53.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a good start but then let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.990" end="01:00:56.100" style="s2">that it does that in a way that also</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.670" end="01:00:57.600" style="s2">reduces the limitations and suffering of</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.100" end="01:01:00.690" style="s2">the people that you interact with and</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.600" end="01:01:02.580" style="s2">now and into the future well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.690" end="01:01:04.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to do that I mean a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.580" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">negotiation does that right because if</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.350" end="01:01:07.890" style="s2">you&#39;re negotiating with someone like</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:10.350" style="s2">your wife for example what you want is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.890" end="01:01:12.210" style="s2">for her to agree with the negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.350" end="01:01:14.610" style="s2">and one of the things that Piaget said</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.210" end="01:01:17.370" style="s2">which I think was brilliant brilliant he</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.610" end="01:01:20.310" style="s2">said if you take an equilibrated system</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.370" end="01:01:21.780" style="s2">a family let&#39;s say and a dis equilibrate</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.310" end="01:01:23.490" style="s2">it system so that would be one way or</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.780" end="01:01:25.620" style="s2">let&#39;s say the father is a tyrant and</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.490" end="01:01:27.210" style="s2">everyone is operating under his whip and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.620" end="01:01:30.360" style="s2">you put them in a head-to-head</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.210" end="01:01:32.310" style="s2">competition the equilibrated system will</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.360" end="01:01:34.830" style="s2">out-compete the disequilibrium system</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.310" end="01:01:36.870" style="s2">because the enforcement cost is such</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.830" end="01:01:38.340" style="s2">that it will slow the system down you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.870" end="01:01:40.350" style="s2">know because you&#39;ll get resistances from</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.340" end="01:01:41.940" style="s2">the people inside the system they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.350" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">work in the system we&#39;ll be working at</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.940" end="01:01:46.680" style="s2">counter purposes to itself plus there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">enforcement costs and so a tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.680" end="01:01:50.970" style="s2">cannot beat an elaborated system and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">was really excited to encounter that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.970" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">idea because when I encountered it I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.280" end="01:01:58.620" style="s2">also trying to figure out if there was</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.960" end="01:02:00.270" style="s2">some quantitative difference between the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.620" end="01:02:02.460" style="s2">system say of the Soviet Union and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.270" end="01:02:05.210" style="s2">Maoist China and the systems of the West</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.460" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">apart from just you know arbitrary world</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.210" end="01:02:08.670" style="s2">interpretation as the postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:10.920" style="s2">nihilists might have it if there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.670" end="01:02:13.110" style="s2">something fundamental at stake in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.920" end="01:02:14.370" style="s2">terrible Cold War that we fought or it</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.110" end="01:02:16.770" style="s2">was just a matter of opinion</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.370" end="01:02:19.380" style="s2">you know when the PIA jetty intake was</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.770" end="01:02:21.330" style="s2">that well roughly speaking is that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.380" end="01:02:23.100" style="s2">West was an equilibrated system no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.330" end="01:02:24.630" style="s2">perfectly equilibrated but reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.100" end="01:02:26.970" style="s2">equilibrate in that people were</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.630" end="01:02:29.130" style="s2">essentially even if they were slaves to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.970" end="01:02:31.170" style="s2">some degree they were at least voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.130" end="01:02:32.850" style="s2">slaves instead of involuntary slaves and</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.170" end="01:02:35.970" style="s2">that that was better the system was</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.850" end="01:02:38.220" style="s2">actually technically better and not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.970" end="01:02:39.690" style="s2">as a matter of interpretation so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.220" end="01:02:42.270" style="s2">a lovely thing to know and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.690" end="01:02:44.610" style="s2">a really really solid really really</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.270" end="01:02:46.320" style="s2">solid idea I haven&#39;t been able to you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.610" end="01:02:49.620" style="s2">know put crowbars under that idea and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.320" end="01:02:52.320" style="s2">lift it up I think it&#39;s a good one so</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.620" end="01:02:54.300" style="s2">now sarai abram&#39;s wife bear him no</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.320" end="01:02:56.310" style="s2">children so okay back to children muscle</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.300" end="01:02:57.780" style="s2">one of what one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.310" end="01:02:59.040" style="s2">worth thinking about with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.780" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">reading these old stories because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.040" end="01:03:03.090" style="s2">so not we&#39;re very arrogant modern people</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:05.010" style="s2">i we look at these old stories and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.090" end="01:03:06.540" style="s2">think hey we&#39;ve transcended all that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.010" end="01:03:07.860" style="s2">superstition it&#39;s like don&#39;t be so</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.540" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">bloody sure about that these people</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.860" end="01:03:13.590" style="s2">weren&#39;t stupid and so there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:16.050" style="s2">ways that they viewed the world that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.590" end="01:03:19.530" style="s2">don&#39;t have anymore and one of them seems</p>

<p begin="01:03:19.530" end="01:03:22.920" style="s2">because that just isn&#39;t part of our way</p>

<p begin="01:03:42.540" end="01:03:47.700" style="s2">is that we need to take a longer view</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.450" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">and consider more things in our purview</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.700" end="01:03:51.570" style="s2">when we act and like that fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:53.580" style="s2">like do we really want a notion that has</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.570" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">nothing in it but jellyfish because</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.580" end="01:03:56.940" style="s2">that&#39;s really what we&#39;re doing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">doing it very very rapidly and the data</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.940" end="01:04:01.620" style="s2">on that are very clear and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:02.940" style="s2">when you lift up your eyes and you make</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.620" end="01:04:04.920" style="s2">a connection with something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.940" end="01:04:06.870" style="s2">transcendent then that should bring more</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.920" end="01:04:09.000" style="s2">of the world within your purview and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.870" end="01:04:10.500" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s concern for the endless</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.000" end="01:04:12.840" style="s2">number of descendants that you might</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.500" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">have might think - well you know if</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.840" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">you&#39;re a successful person if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:19.430" style="s2">successful family god only knows how</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:21.600" style="s2">many people you will be the father of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.430" end="01:04:24.090" style="s2">right it&#39;s completely because you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.600" end="01:04:26.070" style="s2">nexus right all sorts of things have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.090" end="01:04:28.110" style="s2">come together in the cosmos to produce</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.070" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">you and then all things sorts of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.110" end="01:04:32.580" style="s2">manifest themselves from you you have no</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:34.590" style="s2">idea what your potential the potential</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.580" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">consequences of your actions might be as</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.590" end="01:04:40.530" style="s2">they cascade across time right you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:41.910" style="s2">no idea and so Abraham at least is</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.530" end="01:04:44.070" style="s2">concerned with these sorts of things and</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.910" end="01:04:46.350" style="s2">God seems to be concerned too because he</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.070" end="01:04:48.300" style="s2">promises Abraham that if he maintains</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.350" end="01:04:51.260" style="s2">the covenant that the most important</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.300" end="01:04:53.720" style="s2">things that he needs will come to him</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.260" end="01:04:56.670" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty serious about this so</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.720" end="01:04:58.170" style="s2">Sarai talks to Abram she&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.670" end="01:04:58.730" style="s2">happy about the fact that she can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.170" end="01:05:01.020" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.730" end="01:05:03.480" style="s2">she says behold now the LORD hath</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.020" end="01:05:06.300" style="s2">restrained me from bearing I pray</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.480" end="01:05:08.670" style="s2">they go in unto my maid it may be that I</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.300" end="01:05:10.830" style="s2">obtain children by her and Abram</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.670" end="01:05:12.330" style="s2">hearkened to the voice of Sarai well</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.830" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not a very trivial thing I</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.330" end="01:05:15.810" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think I don&#39;t imagine that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">Sarah was sir I was very happy about</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.810" end="01:05:20.790" style="s2">turning her maid over to her husband and</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:23.670" style="s2">potentially being usurped in the whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.790" end="01:05:26.460" style="s2">childbearing in the whole childbearing</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.670" end="01:05:28.440" style="s2">process not in the least but you know so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.460" end="01:05:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s also a major sacrifice on Sarai&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.440" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">part there&#39;s no doubt about that and of</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.080" end="01:05:33.990" style="s2">course it&#39;s very difficult for us to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:35.820" style="s2">talk about the ethics of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.990" end="01:05:38.010" style="s2">Hagar was a more or less involuntary</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.820" end="01:05:40.800" style="s2">participant in this but that was the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.010" end="01:05:43.410" style="s2">times absolutely the case and of course</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.800" end="01:05:46.050" style="s2">slavery and indentured servitude is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.410" end="01:05:48.359" style="s2">way of mankind except in very very very</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.050" end="01:05:50.040" style="s2">very limited circumstances Carl Jung had</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.359" end="01:05:52.800" style="s2">something to say about that to which I</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.040" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">really liked he said that part of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.800" end="01:05:55.710" style="s2">reason that modern people have it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">the only reason</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.710" end="01:05:59.820" style="s2">there&#39;s the Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">obviously but part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.820" end="01:06:04.020" style="s2">modern people have been able to escape</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:06.090" style="s2">from the catastrophe of tyranny and</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.020" end="01:06:08.820" style="s2">slavery is because we&#39;ve agreed to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.090" end="01:06:10.109" style="s2">ourselves our own slaves right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.820" end="01:06:12.630" style="s2">instead of owning a slave you own</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.109" end="01:06:14.310" style="s2">yourself in a sense and so you trot</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.630" end="01:06:16.050" style="s2">yourself off to work and exploit</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.310" end="01:06:17.190" style="s2">yourself so that you can stay alive and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.050" end="01:06:19.020" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not something that you want</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.190" end="01:06:21.690" style="s2">to do but you&#39;ve taken on the role of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.020" end="01:06:23.220" style="s2">slave in some sense in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.690" end="01:06:24.690" style="s2">your own survival instead of forcing</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.220" end="01:06:25.980" style="s2">someone else to do it which is also</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.690" end="01:06:28.800" style="s2">something I think that&#39;s very noble</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.980" end="01:06:30.690" style="s2">about the West is that we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.800" end="01:06:32.250" style="s2">enslave ourselves as individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.690" end="01:06:33.780" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re not doing that to other</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.250" end="01:06:35.369" style="s2">people no we&#39;re doing it to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.780" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">obviously because the society is</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.369" end="01:06:38.130" style="s2">imperfect but that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:41.490" style="s2">very much worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.130" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">so Ann Abram hearkened to the voice of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.490" end="01:06:48.060" style="s2">Saroyan and Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:49.710" style="s2">her made the Egyptian after Abram had</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.060" end="01:06:52.140" style="s2">dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.710" end="01:06:55.619" style="s2">and gave her to her husband Abram to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.140" end="01:06:57.540" style="s2">his wife that&#39;s the other thing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.619" end="01:06:58.770" style="s2">been so interesting about doing this one</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.540" end="01:07:00.090" style="s2">of the other things about doing this</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.770" end="01:07:02.150" style="s2">biblical series and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.090" end="01:07:04.080" style="s2">things that&#39;s so cool about Google</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.150" end="01:07:10.140" style="s2">despite the fact that they cut off my</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.080" end="01:07:12.840" style="s2">account you can find any piece of art</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.140" end="01:07:14.340" style="s2">that ever existed on Google and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.840" end="01:07:16.680" style="s2">that&#39;s great so you know when I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.340" end="01:07:17.460" style="s2">to illustrate these these lectures I</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.680" end="01:07:20.700" style="s2">type in</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.460" end="01:07:23.010" style="s2">Abraham Renaissance and then like I get</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.700" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">200 Renaissance paintings it&#39;s so great</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.010" end="01:07:26.339" style="s2">and then I can look at them and one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:28.349" style="s2">the other things that&#39;s so remarkable is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.339" end="01:07:29.970" style="s2">that all of these the major themes of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.349" end="01:07:34.950" style="s2">these stories have been illustrated by</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.970" end="01:07:37.380" style="s2">people of spectacular mind mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.950" end="01:07:41.430" style="s2">expanding talent you know there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.380" end="01:07:45.690" style="s2">this endless array of well look at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.430" end="01:07:47.880" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s an amazing painting and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.690" end="01:07:50.339" style="s2">and there&#39;s and and of this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.880" end="01:07:51.869" style="s2">there&#39;s dozens of paintings on this</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.339" end="01:07:54.119" style="s2">theme and it&#39;s just another indication</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.869" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">of how obsessed people you know this was</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.119" end="01:07:58.650" style="s2">the only book that existed for years and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:00.750" style="s2">people were absolutely obsessed by it</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.650" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">and produced all these amazing things</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.750" end="01:08:05.220" style="s2">from it and we&#39;re in danger of losing</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:07.710" style="s2">that and that&#39;s a big mistake because</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.220" end="01:08:10.490" style="s2">it&#39;s magnificent a little humility would</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.710" end="01:08:13.230" style="s2">go a long way towards restoring it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.490" end="01:08:16.350" style="s2">he went in done unto Hagar and she</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.230" end="01:08:18.509" style="s2">conceived and when she saw that she had</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.350" end="01:08:19.170" style="s2">conceived her mistress was despised in</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.509" end="01:08:23.609" style="s2">her eyes</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.170" end="01:08:27.000" style="s2">so I Hagar was successful and like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.609" end="01:08:30.359" style="s2">was a hallmark of feminine success now</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.000" end="01:08:32.489" style="s2">and certainly then and so she started to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.359" end="01:08:35.250" style="s2">lord it over Sarai which seemed a little</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.489" end="01:08:37.200" style="s2">bit on the ungrateful side I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.250" end="01:08:40.589" style="s2">because Sarai made a big sacrifice to</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.200" end="01:08:42.359" style="s2">allow Hagar to become Abraham&#39;s wife and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.589" end="01:08:44.790" style="s2">so a little bit of gratitude would have</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.359" end="01:08:46.890" style="s2">been an order I suppose at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.790" end="01:08:50.790" style="s2">how the story goes and Sarai said unto</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.890" end="01:08:53.549" style="s2">Abram my wrong be upon thee I have given</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.790" end="01:08:55.859" style="s2">my maid into thy bosom and when she saw</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.549" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">that she had conceived I was despised in</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.859" end="01:09:02.940" style="s2">her eyes the Lord judge between you and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:04.859" style="s2">I and Abraham said unto Sarai behold thy</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.940" end="01:09:07.200" style="s2">maid is in thine hand do to her as it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.859" end="01:09:10.020" style="s2">pleases you and when Sarai dealt hardly</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.200" end="01:09:11.430" style="s2">with her Hagar fled from her face and</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.020" end="01:09:12.930" style="s2">the angel of the Lord found her by a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.430" end="01:09:14.520" style="s2">fountain of water in the wilderness by</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.930" end="01:09:16.830" style="s2">the fountain in the way - sure and he</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.520" end="01:09:19.620" style="s2">said Hagar Sarai&#39;s maid whence camest</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.830" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">thou and whither wilt thou go and she</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.620" end="01:09:23.790" style="s2">said I flee from the face of my mistress</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:25.380" style="s2">right and the angel of the Lord said</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.790" end="01:09:28.410" style="s2">returned to thy mistress and submit</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.380" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">under her hands and the angel said I</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.410" end="01:09:32.819" style="s2">will multiply your seed exceedingly and</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.069" style="s2">shall not be numbered for multitude and</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.819" end="01:09:36.839" style="s2">the angel said behold thou art with</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.110" end="01:10:12.420" style="s2">lives it&#39;s an interesting interlude</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.210" end="01:10:14.219" style="s2">because you know Abraham God has</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.420" end="01:10:15.989" style="s2">established this covenant with Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.219" end="01:10:17.670" style="s2">and obviously things are going wrong in</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.989" end="01:10:20.670" style="s2">the household in a really serious way</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.670" end="01:10:22.830" style="s2">like a really serious way because well</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.670" end="01:10:24.780" style="s2">he&#39;s now had a child by another woman</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.830" end="01:10:26.280" style="s2">and that the two women are not getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.780" end="01:10:29.160" style="s2">along and one is beating the other</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.280" end="01:10:32.219" style="s2">because of her insubordination and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.160" end="01:10:33.690" style="s2">contempt and so she&#39;s so desperate she</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.219" end="01:10:36.300" style="s2">runs out into the desert where she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.690" end="01:10:41.460" style="s2">probably going to die and God comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.300" end="01:10:44.670" style="s2">along and says anyways to to to to Hagar</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.460" end="01:10:46.710" style="s2">that her son shall as well be the father</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.670" end="01:10:48.150" style="s2">of Nations and so that&#39;s partly a</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.710" end="01:10:49.560" style="s2">reflection back on the power of</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.150" end="01:10:51.210" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s covenant right even though</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.560" end="01:10:53.670" style="s2">even though things are going terribly</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.210" end="01:10:55.230" style="s2">wrong locally let&#39;s say the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.670" end="01:10:57.750" style="s2">Abraham has made this overarching</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.230" end="01:10:59.219" style="s2">agreement with God means that all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.750" end="01:11:02.070" style="s2">these catastrophes are taking place</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.219" end="01:11:03.390" style="s2">within a bounded space with an ark we</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.070" end="01:11:05.969" style="s2">could say that&#39;s one way of looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.390" end="01:11:07.790" style="s2">about it and I do think I do think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.969" end="01:11:10.980" style="s2">that&#39;s right because it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.790" end="01:11:13.710" style="s2">you know if everything falls apart</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.980" end="01:11:14.730" style="s2">around you there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple of</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.730" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">want someone standing beside you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.770" end="01:11:21.270" style="s2">for sure that you can trust you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.530" style="s2">want your family around you and you want</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.270" end="01:11:24.300" style="s2">gonna want them to have your back</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.530" end="01:11:26.670" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna want to know that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.300" end="01:11:29.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t do some goddamn stupid thing to</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.670" end="01:11:31.200" style="s2">bring all hell down on yourself and if</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.310" end="01:11:33.390" style="s2">you&#39;re locking any of those when that</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.200" end="01:11:34.620" style="s2">crisis comes there&#39;s a high probability</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.390" end="01:11:36.510" style="s2">it will flatten you and you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.620" end="01:11:38.870" style="s2">able to get up you know it does seem to</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.510" end="01:11:42.390" style="s2">me you can ask yourself this question</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.870" end="01:11:44.640" style="s2">when things collapse around you how much</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.390" end="01:11:46.950" style="s2">utility is knowledge of your own</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.640" end="01:11:49.020" style="s2">moral virtue that&#39;s bad enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.950" end="01:11:51.480" style="s2">late it&#39;s bad to be laid load but to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.020" end="01:11:54.660" style="s2">laid low and to know that you were a</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.480" end="01:11:56.340" style="s2">fault you were at fault for it and worse</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.660" end="01:11:58.020" style="s2">the things that you did that you knew</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.340" end="01:12:00.090" style="s2">you did that we&#39;re wrong brought you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.020" end="01:12:01.680" style="s2">there then I think you have nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.090" end="01:12:03.900" style="s2">stand on in that situation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.680" end="01:12:06.090" style="s2">also the circumstances under which I</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.900" end="01:12:08.810" style="s2">think you&#39;re more more likely at least</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.090" end="01:12:11.370" style="s2">to be abandoned by people around you so</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.810" end="01:12:13.260" style="s2">given that you know that the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.370" end="01:12:15.060" style="s2">is coming right that the tragedy of life</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.260" end="01:12:17.010" style="s2">will strike you the question is well how</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.060" end="01:12:20.160" style="s2">do you fortify yourself against that and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.010" end="01:12:22.170" style="s2">all obviously it&#39;s to some degree you do</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.160" end="01:12:24.390" style="s2">that by being materially sensible and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.170" end="01:12:25.800" style="s2">these old people in the test in the old</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.390" end="01:12:28.470" style="s2">testament these ancient people they</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.800" end="01:12:30.840" style="s2">weren&#39;t blind to the utility of having a</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.470" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">good crop and some animals you know that</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.840" end="01:12:34.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s an integral part of</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:36.900" style="s2">their life to take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.260" end="01:12:39.950" style="s2">physically but they&#39;re also wise enough</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.900" end="01:12:43.020" style="s2">to know that there&#39;s an element of moral</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.950" end="01:12:45.690" style="s2">this what would you call it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.020" end="01:12:47.970" style="s2">necessity for moral integration that</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.690" end="01:12:50.340" style="s2">defends you against the catastrophe of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.970" end="01:12:53.370" style="s2">existence even more effectively than</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.340" end="01:12:55.950" style="s2">anything material and even more that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.370" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">stability of the material things is more</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.950" end="01:12:59.820" style="s2">dependent on the integrity of your</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:01.470" style="s2">spirit than the integrity of your spirit</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.820" end="01:13:03.180" style="s2">is dependent on the material things and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.470" end="01:13:05.340" style="s2">I think the evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.180" end="01:13:06.900" style="s2">actually quite clear I read it read a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.340" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">very interesting book a while back</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.900" end="01:13:10.410" style="s2">called the wealth and poverty of Nations</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.150" style="s2">that was written by a Harvard emeritus</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.410" end="01:13:14.040" style="s2">professor of history and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.150" end="01:13:16.800" style="s2">things that he claimed I liked it I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.040" end="01:13:18.270" style="s2">thought it was very smart was that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.800" end="01:13:20.850" style="s2">only true natural resource is</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.270" end="01:13:22.470" style="s2">interpersonal trust if you can set up a</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.850" end="01:13:24.180" style="s2">society where people trust each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.470" end="01:13:26.700" style="s2">then it will instantly become rich and</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.180" end="01:13:29.310" style="s2">he used the example of Japan which is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.700" end="01:13:31.110" style="s2">very conscientious society and very rich</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.310" end="01:13:34.470" style="s2">society but the Japanese have no natural</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.110" end="01:13:35.880" style="s2">resources right none to speak of and yet</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.470" end="01:13:38.310" style="s2">they&#39;re rich and then you have countries</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.880" end="01:13:39.990" style="s2">like the Soviet Russia and and much of</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.310" end="01:13:41.370" style="s2">South America where there&#39;s just natural</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.990" end="01:13:44.370" style="s2">resources that you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.370" end="01:13:45.990" style="s2">like Venezuela just more natural</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.370" end="01:13:48.980" style="s2">resources than you know what to do with</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.990" end="01:13:51.660" style="s2">and the places are absolute catastrophes</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.980" end="01:13:54.720" style="s2">absolute catastrophes of cynicism and</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.660" end="01:13:56.300" style="s2">corruption and so he attempted to</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.720" end="01:13:58.620" style="s2">document the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.300" end="01:14:00.720" style="s2">default interpersonal trust</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.620" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">among citizens within countries and</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.720" end="01:14:05.730" style="s2">their their productivity in their GDP</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.080" end="01:14:07.500" style="s2">and their their standard of living and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.730" end="01:14:09.420" style="s2">found a very very tight relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.500" end="01:14:11.700" style="s2">and I like that a lot and I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.420" end="01:14:13.590" style="s2">story about that quickly that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.700" end="01:14:17.940" style="s2">very interesting I&#39;ll tell you two</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.590" end="01:14:19.860" style="s2">stories one sort of generic well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.940" end="01:14:21.510" style="s2">tell you one personal first so one day I</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.860" end="01:14:23.790" style="s2">lent my car to one of my graduate</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.510" end="01:14:26.490" style="s2">students and he took it to Montreal this</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.790" end="01:14:28.710" style="s2">old Cadillac and mmm</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.490" end="01:14:29.960" style="s2">he got it was a really bad rainstorm in</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.710" end="01:14:32.550" style="s2">Montreal and he was in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.960" end="01:14:34.050" style="s2">highways that are like set into the</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.550" end="01:14:36.210" style="s2">ground and there was like six inches of</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.050" end="01:14:37.650" style="s2">water and he was turning a corner hit</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.210" end="01:14:39.780" style="s2">the brakes and skidded on the water and</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.650" end="01:14:41.910" style="s2">smacked it into the wall and on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.780" end="01:14:43.590" style="s2">corner of the of the bumper you know and</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.910" end="01:14:46.170" style="s2">so then he brought it back and he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.590" end="01:14:47.790" style="s2">very apologetic about it and and his</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.170" end="01:14:49.440" style="s2">name was Matt Shane tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.790" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">because Matt might hear this and I could</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.440" end="01:14:56.070" style="s2">shame him a bit for doing this 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:58.140" style="s2">ago you know and he&#39;s a professor at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.070" end="01:15:00.420" style="s2">Ontario Institute of Technology I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.140" end="01:15:02.190" style="s2">now quite a successful one but anyways</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.420" end="01:15:05.660" style="s2">he brought the car back and I went and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.190" end="01:15:08.250" style="s2">got it evaluated for damages it was like</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.660" end="01:15:10.740" style="s2">$1,700 or something to repair it and or</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.250" end="01:15:13.620" style="s2">maybe more but it was almost as much as</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.740" end="01:15:16.770" style="s2">the car was worth I thought well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.620" end="01:15:20.040" style="s2">gonna do that so I went online and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.770" end="01:15:21.930" style="s2">typed in the part and if you do that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.040" end="01:15:23.880" style="s2">can get people to bid on sending you a</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.930" end="01:15:25.230" style="s2">used part from all over North America so</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.880" end="01:15:26.790" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of cool so there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.230" end="01:15:28.350" style="s2">junk dealers have got together and they</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.790" end="01:15:29.850" style="s2">have this you know network of</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.350" end="01:15:31.530" style="s2">communication so you put in the car part</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.850" end="01:15:34.050" style="s2">and then they send you a bid and so this</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.530" end="01:15:35.670" style="s2">guy said well I&#39;ll send you the bumper</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.050" end="01:15:38.850" style="s2">assembly which is the whole bumper and</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.670" end="01:15:40.260" style="s2">the lights for like 250 bucks and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.850" end="01:15:42.540" style="s2">thought yeah okay you could do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.260" end="01:15:46.140" style="s2">that&#39;d be good so then I said yes and</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.540" end="01:15:47.880" style="s2">then he called me up about half an hour</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.140" end="01:15:49.350" style="s2">later this guy from way down south he</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.880" end="01:15:52.260" style="s2">had a really deep sort of Mississippi</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.350" end="01:15:54.870" style="s2">accent he said wait a sec was that for</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.260" end="01:15:56.010" style="s2">the bumper or the bumper assembly and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.870" end="01:15:57.840" style="s2">said well it was for the bumper assembly</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.010" end="01:15:59.250" style="s2">he said oh I thought it was for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.840" end="01:16:01.230" style="s2">bumper and then he said but that&#39;s ok</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.250" end="01:16:03.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll send it to you anyways I thought</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.230" end="01:16:04.860" style="s2">well that&#39;s pretty good so I said well</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.600" end="01:16:06.780" style="s2">thank you and then I hung up and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.860" end="01:16:08.490" style="s2">half an hour later he called me up again</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.780" end="01:16:09.960" style="s2">and he said look I just went out and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.490" end="01:16:12.210" style="s2">looked at that bumper assembly and</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.960" end="01:16:12.449" style="s2">there&#39;s a plastic trim piece on the side</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.210" end="01:16:14.010" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.449" end="01:16:15.690" style="s2">it has a scratch in it and I thought I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.010" end="01:16:17.999" style="s2">better tell you that just in case you</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.690" end="01:16:20.070" style="s2">you didn&#39;t want it I thought wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.999" end="01:16:22.920" style="s2">so amazing it&#39;s like there&#39;s a miracle</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.070" end="01:16:24.449" style="s2">man it&#39;s like this guy he&#39;s somewhere in</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.920" end="01:16:26.519" style="s2">Mississippi I&#39;m never gonna see him</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.449" end="01:16:29.039" style="s2">again ever I&#39;m never gonna have any</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.519" end="01:16:30.690" style="s2">contact with him like he made a bad deal</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.039" end="01:16:32.400" style="s2">right because the part was worth more</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.690" end="01:16:34.139" style="s2">than he decided to sell it to me forever</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.400" end="01:16:35.909" style="s2">but he stuck with his deal and then he</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.139" end="01:16:37.829" style="s2">went over and above the call of duty he</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.909" end="01:16:40.110" style="s2">said well this part that I&#39;m selling you</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.829" end="01:16:42.090" style="s2">to you for way less than it&#39;s worth is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.110" end="01:16:44.940" style="s2">damaged so I thought I&#39;d better tell you</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.090" end="01:16:46.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like man you got to recognize a</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.940" end="01:16:49.530" style="s2">miracle when you see one that was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.650" end="01:16:51.869" style="s2">miracle so I said hey look it&#39;s thanks</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.530" end="01:16:53.880" style="s2">for calling man it&#39;s okay I can handle</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.869" end="01:16:56.429" style="s2">the scratch said the part needed and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.880" end="01:16:57.780" style="s2">I got the car fixed and forgave Matt and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.429" end="01:17:02.070" style="s2">you know it had a happy ending</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.780" end="01:17:04.650" style="s2">so so that&#39;s trust right because I</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.070" end="01:17:06.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t know him from Adam and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.650" end="01:17:08.130" style="s2">primate full of snakes just like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.300" end="01:17:09.900" style="s2">rest of us and yet he was willing to</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.130" end="01:17:11.489" style="s2">simplify himself to the point where I</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.900" end="01:17:13.530" style="s2">could just take him absolutely at his</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.489" end="01:17:15.389" style="s2">word and that meant we could trade even</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.530" end="01:17:17.670" style="s2">though we were strangers it&#39;s like man</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.389" end="01:17:19.530" style="s2">do not underestimate the utility of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.670" end="01:17:21.959" style="s2">and then there&#39;s eBay so when he Bay</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.530" end="01:17:23.610" style="s2">first started you know the idea was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.959" end="01:17:25.409" style="s2">not gonna work because you&#39;ll send me</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.610" end="01:17:27.150" style="s2">junk and I&#39;ll send you a check that</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.409" end="01:17:30.090" style="s2">bounces and that&#39;ll be the end of eBay</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.150" end="01:17:32.309" style="s2">right and so these escrow agents popped</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.090" end="01:17:33.989" style="s2">up so you could ensure your transaction</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.309" end="01:17:36.119" style="s2">with them for like 10% of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.989" end="01:17:37.469" style="s2">transaction they would get the check and</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.119" end="01:17:40.409" style="s2">the goods and make sure that they were</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.469" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">okay and then send them on or ensure the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.409" end="01:17:44.579" style="s2">transaction but what happened was the</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.999" style="s2">escrow agents didn&#39;t make any money and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.579" end="01:17:49.530" style="s2">the reason for that was no one cheated</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.999" end="01:17:50.729" style="s2">now you think about how amazing that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.530" end="01:17:52.979" style="s2">right you bring these people together</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.729" end="01:17:54.570" style="s2">across a whole continent they&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.979" end="01:17:56.159" style="s2">seen each other before they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.570" end="01:17:57.119" style="s2">going to interact with each other again</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.159" end="01:17:59.729" style="s2">and this was before there were any</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.119" end="01:18:02.010" style="s2">reputation ratings on eBay and yet the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.729" end="01:18:02.610" style="s2">default transaction was you describe</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.010" end="01:18:05.400" style="s2">your goods</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.610" end="01:18:07.920" style="s2">honestly including their flaws you set a</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.400" end="01:18:10.619" style="s2">reasonable price I decide to pay you you</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.920" end="01:18:13.229" style="s2">ship the goods and I pay you and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.619" end="01:18:16.139" style="s2">works and what happened was that eBay</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.229" end="01:18:18.479" style="s2">produced it produced a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.139" end="01:18:20.219" style="s2">of capital that was previously frozen so</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.479" end="01:18:22.590" style="s2">frozen capital is when you&#39;ve invested</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.219" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">money in something but the thing is no</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.590" end="01:18:26.190" style="s2">longer useful to you so the money is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">just sitting there free</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.190" end="01:18:31.469" style="s2">right so to speak and you can&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">loose because well you&#39;ve got attic full</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.469" end="01:18:35.489" style="s2">of junk how are you gonna get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:36.719" style="s2">that Oh II may and so all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.489" end="01:18:39.060" style="s2">all these things that were just junk</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.719" end="01:18:40.710" style="s2">became valuable and everybody got richer</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.060" end="01:18:42.420" style="s2">and none of that wouldn&#39;t it would have</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.710" end="01:18:44.070" style="s2">happened without the covenant that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.420" end="01:18:46.650" style="s2">established between each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.070" end="01:18:49.410" style="s2">predicated on trust and so you might say</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.650" end="01:18:51.390" style="s2">that trust is the currency and currency</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.410" end="01:18:53.130" style="s2">is trust because it&#39;s a promissory note</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.390" end="01:18:55.020" style="s2">right and if people lie then the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.130" end="01:19:00.140" style="s2">currency gets to based very very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.020" end="01:19:05.480" style="s2">and so the economy runs on trust and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.140" end="01:19:05.480" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the overarching covenant</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:11.969" style="s2">so abraham makes this covenant with god</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.300" end="01:19:14.880" style="s2">and he decides that he&#39;s gonna aim high</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.969" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">and live a good life and tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.880" end="01:19:19.469" style="s2">and that puts this boundary around him</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like a walled garden it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.469" end="01:19:22.739" style="s2">walled garden and the inside there</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.600" end="01:19:24.150" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.739" end="01:19:27.120" style="s2">happening that are complex and difficult</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.150" end="01:19:31.320" style="s2">but outside there&#39;s a boundary and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.120" end="01:19:33.840" style="s2">boundary is well maybe things won&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.320" end="01:19:35.219" style="s2">like God says after the flood he says</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.840" end="01:19:36.840" style="s2">I&#39;ll never send a flood again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.219" end="01:19:38.940" style="s2">part of the story and so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.840" end="01:19:40.560" style="s2">intimation there that no matter how bad</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.940" end="01:19:42.420" style="s2">things get they won&#39;t get so bad that</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.560" end="01:19:44.130" style="s2">they&#39;ll be catastrophic but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.420" end="01:19:46.080" style="s2">but there&#39;s a coded to that which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.130" end="01:19:51.660" style="s2">that you have to maintain the covenant</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.080" end="01:19:53.400" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know what that means you</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.660" end="01:19:56.280" style="s2">know because you know what you think</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.400" end="01:19:58.650" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty obvious that if you treat</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.280" end="01:20:00.630" style="s2">people well if you really think about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.650" end="01:20:04.170" style="s2">and you&#39;re not being naively optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.630" end="01:20:06.270" style="s2">and like you know a nice good person</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.170" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">with all the weakness that that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.270" end="01:20:15.000" style="s2">that that that intimates of your being</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:17.010" style="s2">hard-nosed and sensible you understand</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.000" end="01:20:19.260" style="s2">that if you treat people</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.010" end="01:20:21.000" style="s2">if you trust people that&#39;s an act of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.260" end="01:20:22.489" style="s2">courage if you&#39;re not naive right if</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.000" end="01:20:25.500" style="s2">you&#39;re naive it&#39;s an act of stupidity</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.489" end="01:20:26.910" style="s2">because you might get bit and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.500" end="01:20:28.770" style="s2">probably will and if you&#39;re not even you</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.910" end="01:20:30.750" style="s2">get bit you will suffer for it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.770" end="01:20:32.340" style="s2">traumatize you but if you&#39;re not naive</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.750" end="01:20:33.480" style="s2">and you know you can get bit then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.340" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">might ask well what should you do with</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.480" end="01:20:37.920" style="s2">people and the answer is you should</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:39.630" style="s2">trust them and not because you&#39;re naive</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.920" end="01:20:40.139" style="s2">and not because they couldn&#39;t betray you</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.630" end="01:20:41.429" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.139" end="01:20:44.189" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know that they could</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.429" end="01:20:45.929" style="s2">betray oh but because if you hold out</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.189" end="01:20:47.399" style="s2">your hand in trust then you&#39;re inviting</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.929" end="01:20:48.989" style="s2">the best part of that person to step</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.399" end="01:20:50.369" style="s2">forward and that won&#39;t happen unless you</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.989" end="01:20:52.800" style="s2">take that initial step and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.369" end="01:20:54.630" style="s2">courage not naivety and so to trust</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.800" end="01:20:56.880" style="s2">someone once your eyes are open that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.630" end="01:21:00.979" style="s2">an act of courage and that opens up the</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.880" end="01:21:00.979" style="s2">world you know when you might say okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.040" end="01:21:11.810" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this idea in this story</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.230" end="01:21:14.600" style="s2">that you can withstand it a fair bit of</p>

<p begin="01:23:23.660" end="01:23:27.110" style="s2">into it well you can experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.820" end="01:23:28.700" style="s2">that because you can start in your own</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.110" end="01:23:31.820" style="s2">household you can start in your own room</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.700" end="01:23:33.530" style="s2">and you could make miracles happen in</p>

<p begin="01:23:40.760" end="01:23:48.350" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s happening and so so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.980" end="01:23:51.110" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be too cynical about about</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.350" end="01:23:53.300" style="s2">where we might be headed and Hagar bore</p>

<p begin="01:24:09.100" end="01:24:14.210" style="s2">so that section ends and then again we</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.140" end="01:24:16.760" style="s2">have an encounter between Abraham and</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.210" end="01:24:18.980" style="s2">God who and Abram was ninety years old</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.760" end="01:24:20.840" style="s2">and nine 99 years old the Lord appeared</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.980" end="01:24:24.850" style="s2">to them and said I&#39;m the Almighty God</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.530" end="01:25:03.650" style="s2">have picked and chosen of course you</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.060" end="01:25:05.450" style="s2">never know that whether you do that but</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.650" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">it does seem in keeping with the</p>

<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:11.330" style="s2">because what we&#39;ve I bought this eye so</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.140" end="01:25:13.430" style="s2">far is that God is called Abraham and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.330" end="01:25:15.620" style="s2">said you know get out there in the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.430" end="01:25:18.320" style="s2">go go to where it&#39;s unknown go to where</p>

<p begin="01:25:22.400" end="01:25:26.630" style="s2">it regardless of the proximal evidence</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.890" end="01:25:28.460" style="s2">great things will come of it and so I</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.630" end="01:25:30.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s what the walking before God</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.460" end="01:25:31.970" style="s2">refers to it&#39;s not like Abraham is</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.050" end="01:25:32.300" style="s2">acting in certainty there&#39;s no certainty</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.970" end="01:25:34.579" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.300" end="01:25:36.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the act of the leap of faith even</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.579" end="01:25:37.940" style="s2">because it does require a leap of faith</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.020" end="01:25:39.369" style="s2">for you to move into the world because</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.940" end="01:25:41.000" style="s2">the world is a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.369" end="01:25:43.190" style="s2">self-evidently the world is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.000" end="01:25:45.800" style="s2">catastrophe and so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.190" end="01:25:49.070" style="s2">there&#39;s every reason for you to assume</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.800" end="01:25:51.290" style="s2">that you should sit in your basement and</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.070" end="01:25:52.579" style="s2">hide from it but that&#39;s that&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.290" end="01:25:54.139" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help it doesn&#39;t make things</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.579" end="01:25:55.550" style="s2">better and the thing is perhaps you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.139" end="01:25:57.530" style="s2">not built for that you&#39;re not built to</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.550" end="01:26:01.639" style="s2">hide I don&#39;t think that people are built</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.530" end="01:26:03.710" style="s2">to hide I think it destroys them and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.639" end="01:26:05.780" style="s2">walking before God in some sense means</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.710" end="01:26:07.250" style="s2">that Abraham is we could say is taking</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.780" end="01:26:09.190" style="s2">the lead he&#39;s the person that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.250" end="01:26:11.090" style="s2">out there until the unknown God says</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.190" end="01:26:12.770" style="s2">well the great things are gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.090" end="01:26:15.050" style="s2">he&#39;s a little short on details that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.770" end="01:26:16.280" style="s2">for sure so the wait is still on Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.050" end="01:26:18.469" style="s2">and that&#39;s a good thing because it also</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.280" end="01:26:19.849" style="s2">that a noble&#39;s Abraham right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.469" end="01:26:21.710" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s so cool is that if</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.849" end="01:26:25.579" style="s2">God had just laid out the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.710" end="01:26:26.960" style="s2">and and and you know brush the branches</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.579" end="01:26:28.400" style="s2">from Abraham&#39;s path while he was walking</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.960" end="01:26:30.829" style="s2">forward well then there&#39;d be nothing for</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.400" end="01:26:32.780" style="s2">Abraham to do there&#39;d be no nobility in</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.829" end="01:26:34.340" style="s2">his own pursuit and this is another</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.780" end="01:26:36.020" style="s2">thing that we don&#39;t understand very well</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.340" end="01:26:38.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a really tough thing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.020" end="01:26:41.719" style="s2">it&#39;s like how much trouble would you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.510" end="01:26:43.400" style="s2">want there not to be it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.719" end="01:26:45.230" style="s2">question right because you want to have</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.400" end="01:26:47.900" style="s2">something to contend with you want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.230" end="01:26:49.520" style="s2">have something that that forces from you</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.900" end="01:26:51.170" style="s2">the best that you have and so you have</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.170" end="01:26:54.619" style="s2">like that would you dispense with all</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.820" end="01:26:57.079" style="s2">your real but you could just lay down on</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.619" end="01:26:59.270" style="s2">a bed have pablum infused into your</p>

<p begin="01:27:09.679" end="01:27:13.070" style="s2">comes along with that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.360" end="01:27:14.270" style="s2">about the nobility of the enterprise you</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.070" end="01:27:16.250" style="s2">certainly see that when you go about</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.270" end="01:27:18.559" style="s2">having children for example which is you</p>

<p begin="01:27:18.559" end="01:27:21.800" style="s2">quite clear if if you do</p>

<p begin="01:27:29.719" end="01:27:34.040" style="s2">intelligent discoveries like that one</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.639" end="01:27:36.889" style="s2">immediately some of them jump to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.040" end="01:27:38.900" style="s2">conclusion that because happiness is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.889" end="01:27:40.820" style="s2">goal that well there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.900" end="01:27:42.559" style="s2">children that you know make you unhappy</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.820" end="01:27:44.389" style="s2">and that&#39;s not good it&#39;s like well wait</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.559" end="01:27:46.159" style="s2">a second and maybe that&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.389" end="01:27:47.929" style="s2">metric it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.159" end="01:27:49.070" style="s2">of course you&#39;re less happy once you</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.929" end="01:27:51.350" style="s2">have children because you have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.070" end="01:27:53.120" style="s2">about them you know my neighbor down the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.350" end="01:27:55.310" style="s2">street who&#39;s very smart woman said to me</p>

<p begin="01:28:03.260" end="01:28:06.469" style="s2">answer isn&#39;t don&#39;t have children it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.850" end="01:28:08.300" style="s2">like don&#39;t be so stupid about being</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.469" end="01:28:10.610" style="s2">happy that&#39;s the answer it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.300" end="01:28:12.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a nobility in the pursuit right</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.610" end="01:28:14.000" style="s2">and of course now you&#39;re responsible you</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.650" end="01:28:15.560" style="s2">know who you have a new baby you think</p>

<p begin="01:28:33.199" end="01:28:37.820" style="s2">something else equally difficult because</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.880" end="01:28:39.860" style="s2">you just you just haven&#39;t been called</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.820" end="01:28:42.199" style="s2">out yet unless you take on a</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.860" end="01:28:44.420" style="s2">responsibility like that the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.199" end="01:28:46.070" style="s2">life is you know that happiness is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.420" end="01:28:48.020" style="s2">purpose of life it&#39;s like great for</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.070" end="01:28:50.360" style="s2">happiness man if it comes along you</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.020" end="01:28:52.489" style="s2">should be thrilled that it&#39;s visiting</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.360" end="01:28:54.080" style="s2">you but the notion that that&#39;s that</p>

<p begin="01:28:54.080" end="01:28:58.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the weakest possible notion first</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.469" end="01:29:00.650" style="s2">of all as soon as something terrible</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.940" end="01:29:02.389" style="s2">happens to you you&#39;re done it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.650" end="01:29:05.270" style="s2">life is to be happy it&#39;s like well now</p>

<p begin="01:29:05.270" end="01:29:10.969" style="s2">happiness thing working out for you now</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.440" end="01:29:12.800" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s not you you know maybe</p>

<p begin="01:29:19.489" end="01:29:23.960" style="s2">person away from them it&#39;s like life is</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.889" end="01:29:25.820" style="s2">to be happy it&#39;s that&#39;s not right and</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.960" end="01:29:27.500" style="s2">and we can at least derive that from</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.820" end="01:29:29.420" style="s2">these stories that isn&#39;t what they say</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.500" end="01:29:32.120" style="s2">at all God&#39;s perfectly happy in this</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.420" end="01:29:33.889" style="s2">stories to grant the people with whom he</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.120" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">forms a covenant happiness and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.889" end="01:29:38.659" style="s2">prosperity but there&#39;s never a word that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:40.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the purpose that the rule is aim</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.659" end="01:29:42.440" style="s2">high and get your bloody act together</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.429" end="01:29:44.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the rule and establish this</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.440" end="01:29:46.100" style="s2">contractual covenant with the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.090" end="01:29:48.110" style="s2">ideal and that will see you through the</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.100" end="01:29:50.120" style="s2">catastrophes and that&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.110" end="01:29:51.889" style="s2">mature way of looking at life as far as</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.120" end="01:29:54.050" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned because all you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.889" end="01:29:56.120" style="s2">is have your eyes half open and you see</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.050" end="01:29:58.300" style="s2">that the fundamental reality of life is</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.120" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">tragedy and suffering there&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.300" end="01:30:01.820" style="s2">inescapable</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:04.430" style="s2">the quest that doesn&#39;t mean that it it</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.820" end="01:30:06.350" style="s2">makes life unbearable or that it makes</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.430" end="01:30:08.810" style="s2">being something that shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.350" end="01:30:11.030" style="s2">existed right that isn&#39;t what it means</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.810" end="01:30:12.440" style="s2">but it means that you have to contend</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.030" end="01:30:15.140" style="s2">with it and you have to get ready and</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.440" end="01:30:17.390" style="s2">the willingness to adopt responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.140" end="01:30:19.400" style="s2">for yourself and for others is is the</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.390" end="01:30:21.170" style="s2">precondition for that and and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.400" end="01:30:22.670" style="s2">if you do that properly then now and</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.170" end="01:30:24.230" style="s2">then you get some happiness you know you</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.670" end="01:30:26.000" style="s2">can sit at the end of the day and you</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.230" end="01:30:27.950" style="s2">have half an hour where your conscience</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.000" end="01:30:29.690" style="s2">is clear and there&#39;s nothing that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.950" end="01:30:31.790" style="s2">need to be doing and you can relax and</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.690" end="01:30:33.620" style="s2">think you know that&#39;s all right things</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.790" end="01:30:35.630" style="s2">are okay and thank God for that and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.620" end="01:30:39.980" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s maybe where you get your</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.630" end="01:30:42.890" style="s2">happiness so and that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.980" end="01:30:45.560" style="s2">growing up man obviously and and to not</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.890" end="01:30:47.090" style="s2">know that and to not be taught that like</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.560" end="01:30:49.940" style="s2">everyone should be taught that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.090" end="01:30:51.470" style="s2">obvious we should be taught that well</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.940" end="01:30:54.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly what these biblical</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.470" end="01:30:55.790" style="s2">stories do and I&#39;ll make my covenant</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.410" end="01:30:58.550" style="s2">between me and thee and we&#39;ll multiply</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.790" end="01:31:02.480" style="s2">the exceedingly and Abram fell on his</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.550" end="01:31:05.450" style="s2">face yea and God talked with him saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.480" end="01:31:07.040" style="s2">as for me behold my covenant is with</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.450" end="01:31:09.500" style="s2">thee and thou shalt be a father of many</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.040" end="01:31:11.240" style="s2">nations God says this alot taébem right</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.500" end="01:31:12.590" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like he has to remind him</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.240" end="01:31:14.110" style="s2">now and then and it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.590" end="01:31:16.190" style="s2">because he keeps going through these</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.110" end="01:31:19.070" style="s2">unbelievable adventures you know that</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.190" end="01:31:21.320" style="s2">are really psychologically and socially</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.070" end="01:31:23.960" style="s2">shattering so it&#39;s a good thing that</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.320" end="01:31:25.610" style="s2">this reminder pops up in it and fairly</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.960" end="01:31:28.460" style="s2">frequently but of course Abraham is also</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.610" end="01:31:32.660" style="s2">open to it and I think what does it mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.460" end="01:31:35.300" style="s2">you know I&#39;ll talk personally for a</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.660" end="01:31:36.590" style="s2">moment I guess so I&#39;ve asked myself a</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.300" end="01:31:39.110" style="s2">lot of questions in the last eight</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.590" end="01:31:40.400" style="s2">months man I can tell you that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.110" end="01:31:42.530" style="s2">still asking myself a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.400" end="01:31:44.360" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been conferring with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.530" end="01:31:46.790" style="s2">people I had lots of people who were</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.360" end="01:31:49.520" style="s2">helping me negotiate whatever the hell</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.790" end="01:31:51.050" style="s2">this is that&#39;s happening and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.520" end="01:31:52.310" style="s2">could ask them how it was doing and they</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.050" end="01:31:53.630" style="s2">would tell me a bunch of things I was</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.310" end="01:31:55.070" style="s2">doing wrong and some things I was doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.630" end="01:31:56.810" style="s2">right and I could listen to them and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.070" end="01:31:58.810" style="s2">was asking questions all the time about</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.810" end="01:32:03.320" style="s2">how the hell I should manage this</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.810" end="01:32:05.630" style="s2">properly and you know what what I was</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.320" end="01:32:08.030" style="s2">trying to do and what seemed to serve me</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.630" end="01:32:10.490" style="s2">properly was to figure out how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.030" end="01:32:12.500" style="s2">correctly that was the issue it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.490" end="01:32:13.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t really care what happened and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.500" end="01:32:15.230" style="s2">guess I really don&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.730" end="01:32:16.700" style="s2">and said but I do care if I do it</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.230" end="01:32:19.100" style="s2">correctly because I don&#39;t want to screw</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.700" end="01:32:21.860" style="s2">it up I don&#39;t want to screw things up</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.100" end="01:32:23.390" style="s2">and that seems to be a reasonable goal</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.860" end="01:32:25.460" style="s2">for people I mean wouldn&#39;t you like that</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.390" end="01:32:27.650" style="s2">as a goal that you don&#39;t screw things up</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.460" end="01:32:29.780" style="s2">because you can&#39;t control - you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.650" end="01:32:32.000" style="s2">your life isn&#39;t fully under your control</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.780" end="01:32:33.950" style="s2">by any stretch of the imagination but it</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.000" end="01:32:36.110" style="s2">might be nice to - not have your</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.950" end="01:32:38.240" style="s2">conscience eating at you saying look you</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.110" end="01:32:40.670" style="s2">know you had a big opportunity there and</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.240" end="01:32:43.730" style="s2">you mucked it up because you&#39;re weak and</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.670" end="01:32:46.130" style="s2">blind and you didn&#39;t listen that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.730" end="01:32:47.870" style="s2">good the cast the catastrophe is bad</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.130" end="01:32:55.340" style="s2">enough as I said without you being the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.870" end="01:32:57.050" style="s2">bloody source of it and so well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.340" end="01:32:59.270" style="s2">Abram falling on his face I guess and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.050" end="01:33:02.000" style="s2">also communing with God it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.270" end="01:33:04.640" style="s2">don&#39;t he wants to get it right he wants</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.000" end="01:33:08.780" style="s2">to get it right and there&#39;s these these</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.640" end="01:33:10.370" style="s2">things that beckon and promise but but</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.780" end="01:33:12.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s bloody easy to make a</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.370" end="01:33:17.210" style="s2">catastrophic mistake and he&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.050" end="01:33:18.800" style="s2">in your life you know and and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.210" end="01:33:20.330" style="s2">humility is one of the things that can</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.800" end="01:33:21.770" style="s2">prevent that because you can look and</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.330" end="01:33:23.390" style="s2">you can think okay what am I doing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.770" end="01:33:25.760" style="s2">what am I doing wrong what can I do</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.390" end="01:33:29.180" style="s2">better how could I do this properly and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.760" end="01:33:31.130" style="s2">then maybe you know you get you get you</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.180" end="01:33:32.570" style="s2">get the intimation of the proper way to</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.130" end="01:33:34.970" style="s2">move forward and maybe that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.570" end="01:33:37.070" style="s2">protects you when things are chaotic and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.970" end="01:33:41.450" style="s2">and in strife and who knows what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.070" end="01:33:43.880" style="s2">worth neither shall thy name anymore be</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.450" end="01:33:46.100" style="s2">called Abram which means high king if I</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.880" end="01:33:47.720" style="s2">remember correctly but thy name shall be</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.100" end="01:33:50.540" style="s2">Abraham for a father of many nations</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.720" end="01:33:53.420" style="s2">have I made thee oh yes Abram for high</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.540" end="01:33:54.950" style="s2">father look at that Abraham means father</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.420" end="01:33:57.380" style="s2">of a multitude and I will make the</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.950" end="01:33:58.820" style="s2">exceedingly fruitful and I will make</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.380" end="01:34:00.470" style="s2">nations have the productive right</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.820" end="01:34:02.120" style="s2">productive and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.470" end="01:34:03.830" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s good to be I</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.120" end="01:34:07.730" style="s2">mean like one of the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.830" end="01:34:09.620" style="s2">thought about deeply I thought deeply</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.730" end="01:34:11.150" style="s2">about death and the death of my family</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.620" end="01:34:12.650" style="s2">members and about funerals and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.150" end="01:34:14.300" style="s2">about it partly because I had this weird</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.650" end="01:34:15.710" style="s2">experience once that I think I told you</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.300" end="01:34:18.590" style="s2">about where I took one of my clients to</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.710" end="01:34:20.630" style="s2">see an embalming which is very strange</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.590" end="01:34:21.980" style="s2">experience and I had a chance to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.630" end="01:34:24.260" style="s2">the funeral directors you know because</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.980" end="01:34:27.110" style="s2">they have weird jobs you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.260" end="01:34:27.659" style="s2">this idea well the Freudian idea that</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.110" end="01:34:29.489" style="s2">people saw</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.659" end="01:34:31.260" style="s2">for from this terrible death anxiety and</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.489" end="01:34:33.209" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole line of social</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.260" end="01:34:34.499" style="s2">psychological theory theorizing called</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.209" end="01:34:36.599" style="s2">terror management theory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.499" end="01:34:38.610" style="s2">predicated on the idea that we defend</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.599" end="01:34:40.679" style="s2">ourselves against death anxiety with our</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.610" end="01:34:41.939" style="s2">belief systems and like it&#39;s a puppet</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.679" end="01:34:43.499" style="s2">Ernest Becker&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.939" end="01:34:45.360" style="s2">he wrote the denial of death which is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.499" end="01:34:46.769" style="s2">great book but there&#39;s a weakness in it</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.360" end="01:34:48.449" style="s2">because you see some people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.769" end="01:34:50.610" style="s2">like that you know like emergency room</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.449" end="01:34:52.079" style="s2">nurses aren&#39;t like that and palliative</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.610" end="01:34:53.849" style="s2">care nurses aren&#39;t like that my</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.079" end="01:34:56.939" style="s2">sister-in-law&#39;s a palliative care nurse</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.849" end="01:34:58.409" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard job right because you go</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.939" end="01:35:00.059" style="s2">in there you&#39;re caring for people you</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.409" end="01:35:01.530" style="s2">have and they&#39;re in pain and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.059" end="01:35:02.849" style="s2">the last legs you&#39;re trying to make them</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.530" end="01:35:04.380" style="s2">comfortable and you have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.849" end="01:35:05.639" style="s2">with them because how the hell are you</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.380" end="01:35:07.139" style="s2">gonna make them comfortable if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.639" end="01:35:08.639" style="s2">and then they go and die on you and that</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.139" end="01:35:11.070" style="s2">just happens that&#39;s what happens every</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.639" end="01:35:12.840" style="s2">day right and what&#39;s weird is that</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.070" end="01:35:14.039" style="s2">people can be palliative care nurses</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.840" end="01:35:16.889" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you figure that out</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.039" end="01:35:17.999" style="s2">because people can actually thrive in</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.889" end="01:35:20.010" style="s2">the face of death</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.999" end="01:35:21.599" style="s2">strangely enough and like these funeral</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.010" end="01:35:22.860" style="s2">parlor directors they were interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.599" end="01:35:25.139" style="s2">to talk to because that&#39;s all they do</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.860" end="01:35:28.469" style="s2">right they just deal with they deal with</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.139" end="01:35:30.150" style="s2">death and grief all the time and it was</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.469" end="01:35:32.189" style="s2">very interesting talking to them because</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.150" end="01:35:34.439" style="s2">I talked to two of them they found their</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.189" end="01:35:36.059" style="s2">job extremely meaningful and I asked</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.439" end="01:35:37.559" style="s2">them well you know does that what does</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.059" end="01:35:40.019" style="s2">that do to your life you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.559" end="01:35:42.719" style="s2">saturated with death and suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.019" end="01:35:44.309" style="s2">there and this is the same answer that I</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.719" end="01:35:47.789" style="s2">got from the palliative care nurse is</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.309" end="01:35:50.280" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t undermine your life it</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.789" end="01:35:52.289" style="s2">enriches it now who would guess that</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.280" end="01:35:54.030" style="s2">right I mean what the hell that just</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.289" end="01:35:56.669" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense at all but what</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.030" end="01:35:58.320" style="s2">it does is speak to human possibility</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.669" end="01:36:00.599" style="s2">because god only knows how tough you are</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.320" end="01:36:02.340" style="s2">you know I mean if you read history and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.599" end="01:36:04.829" style="s2">you read about what people have done you</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.340" end="01:36:10.380" style="s2">think wow we&#39;re pretty tough people are</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.829" end="01:36:14.189" style="s2">I read there is a shipwreck in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.380" end="01:36:18.719" style="s2">Antarctica hundred years ago is so and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.189" end="01:36:20.849" style="s2">read the story it&#39;s not a biography if I</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.719" end="01:36:22.349" style="s2">remember correctly of the of the captain</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.849" end="01:36:24.749" style="s2">I might be wrong about that but I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.349" end="01:36:26.789" style="s2">the basic story right well they had a</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.749" end="01:36:29.070" style="s2">shipwreck in the Antarctica was then</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.789" end="01:36:31.380" style="s2">they were there for a whole year in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.070" end="01:36:33.090" style="s2">Antarctica you know and none of them</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.380" end="01:36:35.429" style="s2">died not one II didn&#39;t lose a single man</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.090" end="01:36:37.110" style="s2">not one he kept their morale high and</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.429" end="01:36:39.780" style="s2">then they took this boat that was on the</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.110" end="01:36:41.400" style="s2">ship and they crossed like 400 miles of</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.780" end="01:36:43.890" style="s2">the roughest ocean the</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.400" end="01:36:45.960" style="s2">first frigid ocean in the world right</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.890" end="01:36:48.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t go in that ocean and then they</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.960" end="01:36:50.280" style="s2">went to an island and they walked across</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.360" end="01:36:53.429" style="s2">the island across these mountains that</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.280" end="01:36:55.830" style="s2">no one else has ever climbed since and</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.429" end="01:36:57.030" style="s2">they went to the city on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.830" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">of the island they got a boat and went</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.030" end="01:37:00.239" style="s2">rescued their compatriots and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.520" end="01:37:02.520" style="s2">survived</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.239" end="01:37:04.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like endurance is the name of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.520" end="01:37:08.360" style="s2">book you read that book man you think</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.679" end="01:37:11.070" style="s2">wow people are really tough you know and</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.360" end="01:37:13.469" style="s2">it&#39;s ridiculous so who knows how tough</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.070" end="01:37:15.540" style="s2">you are and maybe you find out by going</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.469" end="01:37:18.239" style="s2">out to find out how tough you are</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.540" end="01:37:20.370" style="s2">right so you take on a challenge one</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.239" end="01:37:22.380" style="s2">that you think you can master just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.370" end="01:37:23.550" style="s2">just a bit beyond your grasp and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.380" end="01:37:24.900" style="s2">master it and then you&#39;re a little</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.550" end="01:37:26.730" style="s2">tougher and you think hey that worked</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.900" end="01:37:28.890" style="s2">out pretty well and so then you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.730" end="01:37:30.179" style="s2">of a monster and then you go out and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.890" end="01:37:31.679" style="s2">find another challenge that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.179" end="01:37:33.420" style="s2">bigger and you think well maybe I can do</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.679" end="01:37:34.920" style="s2">that too and then all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.420" end="01:37:38.100" style="s2">can and you get a little bit bigger and</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.920" end="01:37:40.770" style="s2">god only knows what the limit is of you</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.100" end="01:37:42.030" style="s2">and you find out by pushing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.770" end="01:37:46.650" style="s2">against the world and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.030" end="01:37:48.870" style="s2">what Abraham is doing and so see we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.650" end="01:37:51.719" style="s2">very pessimistic us modern people you</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.870" end="01:37:53.969" style="s2">know we&#39;re pessimistic about humanity</p>

<p begin="01:38:41.460" end="01:38:44.670" style="s2">the problem with being optimistic is</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.840" end="01:38:46.409" style="s2">that it&#39;s naive so then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.670" end="01:38:49.050" style="s2">is there an optimism that&#39;s not naive</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.409" end="01:38:52.310" style="s2">and I think there is and the optimism</p>

<p begin="01:41:57.250" end="01:42:01.090" style="s2">door to me and he was an exhales angels</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.990" end="01:42:03.970" style="s2">biker he&#39;d spent a lot of time in prison</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.090" end="01:42:05.590" style="s2">and his wife had borderline personality</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.970" end="01:42:07.990" style="s2">disorder and she committed suicide when</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.590" end="01:42:11.380" style="s2">I lived there and here&#39;s a rough guy and</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.990" end="01:42:14.800" style="s2">he was a québécois he spoke ul which I</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.380" end="01:42:16.060" style="s2">could hardly understand and he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.800" end="01:42:17.700" style="s2">really know what to make of me and I</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.060" end="01:42:21.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know what to make of him</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.700" end="01:42:23.920" style="s2">but we got along you know I was very</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.790" end="01:42:26.980" style="s2">careful talking to him as you might</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.920" end="01:42:28.720" style="s2">imagine but but I was it was very anyway</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.980" end="01:42:29.890" style="s2">we went over and my wife and I went over</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.720" end="01:42:32.020" style="s2">there and we had the spaghetti dinner</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.890" end="01:42:33.490" style="s2">one night and we sort of communicated</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.020" end="01:42:35.020" style="s2">and I bought a poster from him because</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.490" end="01:42:36.760" style="s2">he made these wooden posters that had</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.020" end="01:42:37.860" style="s2">neon on them and that&#39;s how he made a</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.760" end="01:42:39.330" style="s2">living he&#39;d kind of train</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.860" end="01:42:41.369" style="s2">self to be a bit of an electronics guy</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.330" end="01:42:42.719" style="s2">and so he made these things and he was</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.369" end="01:42:44.070" style="s2">trying to quit drinking and we talked</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.719" end="01:42:45.360" style="s2">about that he was a lot older than me he</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.070" end="01:42:49.679" style="s2">was like 20 years older than me I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.360" end="01:42:52.980" style="s2">about 25 at this point and we got along</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.679" end="01:42:55.320" style="s2">pretty well but every now and then he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.980" end="01:42:56.760" style="s2">go out and get and drink and he could</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.320" end="01:42:58.469" style="s2">really drink you know like he was one of</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.760" end="01:43:00.179" style="s2">these guys who could drink like 60 beer</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.469" end="01:43:01.350" style="s2">and you think well no one can drink that</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.179" end="01:43:03.900" style="s2">much and you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.350" end="01:43:06.929" style="s2">I studied alcohol for like 10 years some</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.900" end="01:43:08.550" style="s2">of my subjects fathers drank 40 ounces</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.929" end="01:43:10.770" style="s2">of vodka a day and had been doing it for</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.550" end="01:43:12.600" style="s2">20 years so you can drink a lot and he</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.770" end="01:43:14.010" style="s2">could drink a lot and what would happen</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.600" end="01:43:15.719" style="s2">he was trying to not drink but he&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.010" end="01:43:18.179" style="s2">out and go on a binge and then he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.719" end="01:43:21.239" style="s2">gone for like three days and he&#39;d drink</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.179" end="01:43:23.550" style="s2">up all his money and then we&#39;d hear him</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.239" end="01:43:25.650" style="s2">out in the backyard howling at the moon</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.550" end="01:43:28.619" style="s2">with this little little ugly dog he had</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.650" end="01:43:30.179" style="s2">you know and he&#39;d howling the dog would</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.619" end="01:43:32.400" style="s2">howl and he&#39;d howl and the dog would</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.179" end="01:43:38.670" style="s2">howl and and it was rather unsettling</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.400" end="01:43:40.949" style="s2">and made my wife nervous and and but</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.670" end="01:43:42.960" style="s2">worse you know now and then he&#39;d come to</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.949" end="01:43:45.119" style="s2">the door at like 3:00 in the morning eh</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.960" end="01:43:48.900" style="s2">and he&#39;d knock on the door and he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.119" end="01:43:50.550" style="s2">standing there and I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.900" end="01:43:52.409" style="s2">experience you&#39;ve had with rough guys</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.550" end="01:43:58.739" style="s2">who are alcoholic and who were drunk but</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.409" end="01:44:00.690" style="s2">it&#39;s they can be upright and unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.739" end="01:44:02.310" style="s2">at the same time and so that was the</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.690" end="01:44:04.830" style="s2">state that he was in you know he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.310" end="01:44:06.960" style="s2">just swaying and he&#39;d asked me if I</p>

<p begin="01:46:46.860" end="01:46:51.240" style="s2">he liked and that it had to stop and</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.570" end="01:46:53.570" style="s2">believe me man I was thinking about what</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.240" end="01:46:57.120" style="s2">I was saying because he was watching me</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.570" end="01:46:59.670" style="s2">like a rough guy watches you and a rough</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.120" end="01:47:02.690" style="s2">guy watches you like this he thinks if</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.670" end="01:47:03.950" style="s2">you say one thing that indicates</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.690" end="01:47:06.450" style="s2">contempt</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.950" end="01:47:09.600" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna bloody well pay for it and</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.450" end="01:47:11.400" style="s2">so I was finding my words like you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.600" end="01:47:13.260" style="s2">I was crossing a swamp and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.400" end="01:47:16.170" style="s2">look for the for the rocks underneath</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.260" end="01:47:18.180" style="s2">the surface and I said what I had to</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.170" end="01:47:21.330" style="s2">save Harry very carefully and he looked</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.180" end="01:47:24.330" style="s2">at me for about 15 seconds and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.330" end="01:47:29.370" style="s2">long time to be looked at at 3:00 in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.330" end="01:47:31.770" style="s2">morning and he left and he never came</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.370" end="01:47:34.110" style="s2">back to sell me anything again and we</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.770" end="01:47:37.800" style="s2">got along fine but that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.110" end="01:47:42.360" style="s2">illustration of this issue with regards</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.800" end="01:47:45.180" style="s2">to truth and success in the strange land</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.360" end="01:47:49.530" style="s2">because I was in the strange land when I</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.180" end="01:47:53.730" style="s2">was talking to my neighbor my landlord</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.530" end="01:47:55.890" style="s2">then and I managed to say what was true</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.730" end="01:47:58.560" style="s2">carefully enough so despite the fact</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.890" end="01:48:01.230" style="s2">that he was a very violent person and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.560" end="01:48:03.300" style="s2">that he was a very intoxicated person</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.230" end="01:48:04.980" style="s2">and that he had every reason to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.300" end="01:48:07.350" style="s2">suspicious of me and we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.980" end="01:48:12.030" style="s2">communicate very well and I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.350" end="01:48:15.060" style="s2">what he wanted that he took it and he</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.030" end="01:48:19.890" style="s2">left and there was no problem and life</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.060" end="01:48:21.990" style="s2">went on just fine after that and so we</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.890" end="01:48:25.410" style="s2">don&#39;t want to underestimate the utility</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.990" end="01:48:27.380" style="s2">of establishing this bounded</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.410" end="01:48:30.960" style="s2">relationship with the ideal and</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.380" end="01:48:33.660" style="s2">attempting to live with some nobility in</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.960" end="01:48:36.120" style="s2">truth while aiming at the highest ideal</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.660" end="01:48:40.740" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.120" end="01:48:45.320" style="s2">anything but strengthening and positive</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.740" end="01:48:48.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s exactly what you need to set</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.320" end="01:48:52.080" style="s2">against the catastrophe and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.060" end="01:48:53.730" style="s2">of life and as far as I can tell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.080" end="01:48:56.300" style="s2">what these Abrahamic stories are</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.730" end="01:48:56.300" style="s2">attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.579" end="01:49:01.940" style="s2">communicate so we&#39;ll stop there thank</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.150" end="01:49:12.820" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="01:51:33.840" end="01:51:37.949" style="s2">talking about this is what I saw you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.909" end="01:51:40.230" style="s2">embodying mind body and spirit and</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.949" end="01:51:41.880" style="s2">bringing it all together as one and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.230" end="01:51:43.110" style="s2">touch on it a bit tonight when you when</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.880" end="01:51:44.940" style="s2">you talk about truth this is where we</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.110" end="01:51:46.500" style="s2">need to go right and I know you see be</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.940" end="01:51:47.550" style="s2">positive and all that and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.500" end="01:51:49.349" style="s2">right I agree</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.550" end="01:51:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s scary what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.349" end="01:51:53.789" style="s2">however we have the power to stay in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.119" end="01:51:55.289" style="s2">positive what you talked about last week</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.789" end="01:51:57.599" style="s2">you talked about using our intuition</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.289" end="01:52:00.119" style="s2">which I consider our higher self using</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.599" end="01:52:02.550" style="s2">consciousness and you made reference I</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.119" end="01:52:05.579" style="s2">can&#39;t remember exactly what you what you</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.550" end="01:52:07.590" style="s2">said but you held your hand and you</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.579" end="01:52:10.260" style="s2">talked about emotions and bringing</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.590" end="01:52:12.480" style="s2">intellect on top and when you said</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.260" end="01:52:13.800" style="s2">emotions everything just lit up for me</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.480" end="01:52:15.630" style="s2">because I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s our heart</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.800" end="01:52:17.789" style="s2">chakra that&#39;s what combines our lower</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.630" end="01:52:19.550" style="s2">self our physical being the material</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.789" end="01:52:22.170" style="s2">stuff all the all the stuff that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.550" end="01:52:24.630" style="s2">really motivate us with our higher self</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.170" end="01:52:26.340" style="s2">I mean you talked about emotion I want</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.630" end="01:52:28.769" style="s2">to talk about the emotion of love and I</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.340" end="01:52:30.780" style="s2">find so many people are terrified it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.769" end="01:52:32.880" style="s2">four-letter word I know but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.780" end="01:52:35.340" style="s2">have to be bad okay so I remember why</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.880" end="01:52:38.460" style="s2">when I talked to you last week I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.340" end="01:52:40.079" style="s2">you to ask this question so okay so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.460" end="01:52:44.340" style="s2">talked a lot in this lecture series</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.079" end="01:52:46.590" style="s2">about truth and know I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.340" end="01:52:48.300" style="s2">battle in the biblical stories all the</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.590" end="01:52:50.219" style="s2">way through between love and truth and</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.300" end="01:52:52.889" style="s2">in terms of their primacy and so and</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.219" end="01:52:55.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve concentrated a lot on truth in my</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.889" end="01:52:56.849" style="s2">own thinking but I stay and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.139" end="01:52:58.710" style="s2">talk about love because it&#39;s a word that</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.849" end="01:53:00.000" style="s2">people have mouths to death you know as</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.710" end="01:53:01.500" style="s2">soon as you start talking about love</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.000" end="01:53:03.510" style="s2">then people should just go into a</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.500" end="01:53:05.429" style="s2">different room and and not listen to you</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.510" end="01:53:08.130" style="s2">you know because it gets it can get</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.429" end="01:53:11.039" style="s2">sappy and new-agey just like that and</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.130" end="01:53:12.269" style="s2">and I don&#39;t like that at all but but it</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.039" end="01:53:15.929" style="s2">still has something that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.269" end="01:53:17.550" style="s2">contended with and I think so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.929" end="01:53:20.340" style="s2">trying to conceptualize let&#39;s say what</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.550" end="01:53:23.550" style="s2">this covenant might might constitute and</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.340" end="01:53:25.590" style="s2">I think the love part so here&#39;s this so</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.550" end="01:53:28.079" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this book by Goethe</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.590" end="01:53:30.630" style="s2">called Faust and it&#39;s in two volumes</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.079" end="01:53:32.340" style="s2">first one and falls to logically enough</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.630" end="01:53:35.610" style="s2">one was written much later than the</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.340" end="01:53:38.699" style="s2">other and Faust basically sells the soul</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.610" end="01:53:40.949" style="s2">to the devil for foreknowledge and the</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.699" end="01:53:42.510" style="s2">devil in Faust is mephistopheles and</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.949" end="01:53:45.810" style="s2">mephistopheles is quite a well-developed</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.510" end="01:53:47.820" style="s2">character and Bertha has Memphis dollies</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.810" end="01:53:50.640" style="s2">say what he&#39;s about which is really</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.820" end="01:53:53.760" style="s2">quite cool so it&#39;s like the adversary of</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.640" end="01:53:56.010" style="s2">the world evil itself gets a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.760" end="01:53:57.360" style="s2">speak and make its case and Goethe</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.010" end="01:53:59.220" style="s2">thought this was so important that he</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.360" end="01:54:02.580" style="s2">actually had Memphis Tov Lee&#39;s announced</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.220" end="01:54:04.230" style="s2">himself once in Faust one and then using</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.580" end="01:54:07.110" style="s2">the same words you know phrase</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.230" end="01:54:08.940" style="s2">differently again in in part two it</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.110" end="01:54:12.500" style="s2">really struck me it really struck me and</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.940" end="01:54:17.060" style="s2">so what Memphis dolefully says is that</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.500" end="01:54:19.170" style="s2">the world is such a charter house of</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.060" end="01:54:21.930" style="s2">suffering and destruction that it would</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.170" end="01:54:24.090" style="s2">be better if it never existed and so</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.930" end="01:54:27.420" style="s2">that what he&#39;s working to is to bring</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.090" end="01:54:30.180" style="s2">existence to an end because it is not</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.420" end="01:54:32.190" style="s2">justified by its suffering that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.180" end="01:54:33.930" style="s2">like--that&#39;s it&#39;s an argument very</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.190" end="01:54:38.600" style="s2">similar to the argument that is made by</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.930" end="01:54:41.820" style="s2">Ivan camera camera radsolv</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.600" end="01:54:44.540" style="s2">thank you thank and say you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.820" end="01:54:47.730" style="s2">pronounce them or live with them you can</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.540" end="01:54:49.710" style="s2">but he basically he&#39;s an atheist and</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.730" end="01:54:51.300" style="s2">does a very good job of detailing out</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.710" end="01:54:53.190" style="s2">the Atheist argument or it may be an</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.300" end="01:54:56.270" style="s2">anti theist argument and he&#39;s arguing</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.190" end="01:54:58.500" style="s2">with his his brother Alyosha who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.270" end="01:55:00.300" style="s2">monastic novitiate who was a very good</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.500" end="01:55:02.520" style="s2">guy but not an intellect Ivan&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.300" end="01:55:06.510" style="s2">intellect and a very powerful one and he</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.520" end="01:55:08.460" style="s2">basically tells le osha that the all of</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.510" end="01:55:10.350" style="s2">the cosmos isn&#39;t worth the suffering of</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.460" end="01:55:12.120" style="s2">one child he tells this story about this</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.350" end="01:55:15.120" style="s2">and this Dostoyevsky took this from a</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.120" end="01:55:16.530" style="s2">newspaper about this parents that locked</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.120" end="01:55:18.870" style="s2">their four-year-old daughter in an</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.530" end="01:55:21.480" style="s2">outhouse overnight and she screamed</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.870" end="01:55:23.880" style="s2">about it until she froze to death and so</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.480" end="01:55:26.100" style="s2">Dostoyevsky used that argument he tied</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.880" end="01:55:28.050" style="s2">that into Ivan&#39;s anti-theist argument</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.100" end="01:55:30.290" style="s2">against le OSHA it&#39;s very very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.050" end="01:55:33.660" style="s2">argument The Brothers Karamazov is an</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.290" end="01:55:37.260" style="s2">absolutely mind-boggling amazing book I</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.660" end="01:55:39.090" style="s2">would highly recommend it and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.260" end="01:55:41.340" style="s2">a Memphis awfully in perspective mr.</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.090" end="01:55:43.080" style="s2">Feeley in perspective perspective is</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.340" end="01:55:46.290" style="s2">that being itself is so corrupt that it</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.080" end="01:55:48.540" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t exist so then you think okay</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.290" end="01:55:50.850" style="s2">well that fair enough that&#39;s a decent</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.540" end="01:55:52.560" style="s2">argument it&#39;s understandable but the</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.850" end="01:55:55.050" style="s2">problem comes when you try to implement</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.560" end="01:55:56.730" style="s2">that and what happens when you implement</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.050" end="01:55:58.650" style="s2">it as far as I can tell you adopt out</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.730" end="01:55:59.370" style="s2">Memphis to aphelion attitude of</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.650" end="01:56:01.590" style="s2">bitterness and</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.370" end="01:56:02.700" style="s2">and destruction is that you make all the</p>

<p begin="01:56:02.700" end="01:56:07.620" style="s2">far worse I think that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.120" end="01:56:09.530" style="s2">at the base of things in the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.620" end="01:56:12.240" style="s2">century is that there was a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.530" end="01:56:14.340" style="s2">movement among human humanity to bring</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.240" end="01:56:15.690" style="s2">being itself to a halt</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.340" end="01:56:17.880" style="s2">you know what culminated in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.690" end="01:56:21.030" style="s2">development of the hydrogen bomb and and</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.880" end="01:56:23.130" style="s2">the high probability for many of many</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.030" end="01:56:25.800" style="s2">periods of time that we were going to do</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.130" end="01:56:27.390" style="s2">something permanent and fatal which</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.800" end="01:56:29.190" style="s2">seems like a bad idea it seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.390" end="01:56:31.410" style="s2">bad idea well so what&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.190" end="01:56:34.170" style="s2">the missed aphelion attitude and I think</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.410" end="01:56:35.970" style="s2">the opposite of that is what&#39;s presented</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.170" end="01:56:40.730" style="s2">in the biblical stories in the guise of</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.970" end="01:56:43.590" style="s2">love and that is the wish that things</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.730" end="01:56:45.600" style="s2">would be good it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.590" end="01:56:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what love is I think is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.600" end="01:56:49.980" style="s2">the attempt to orient yourself towards</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.520" end="01:56:52.080" style="s2">making things better and it&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.980" end="01:56:55.410" style="s2">on something like a deep appreciation</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.080" end="01:56:57.480" style="s2">for being despite its suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.410" end="01:56:59.730" style="s2">deficiencies and and maybe a decision</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.480" end="01:57:02.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to act to bring about</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.730" end="01:57:04.830" style="s2">things to move things towards the good</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.430" end="01:57:07.050" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the thing that sets</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.830" end="01:57:08.820" style="s2">the parameters of that of them it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.050" end="01:57:11.820" style="s2">the opposite of the Memphis to fillion</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.820" end="01:57:13.320" style="s2">attitude it&#39;s like to work towards the</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.820" end="01:57:14.790" style="s2">betterment of being because you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:57:16.710" end="01:57:21.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s within that framework that</p>

<p begin="01:58:18.679" end="01:58:23.999" style="s2">so you&#39;ve been an educator through the</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.300" end="01:58:26.309" style="s2">rise of the smartphone and my question</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.999" end="01:58:29.489" style="s2">basically relates to procrastination and</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.309" end="01:58:32.849" style="s2">tastily needless tastily specifically</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.489" end="01:58:34.289" style="s2">and given the unprecedented level of</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.849" end="01:58:36.389" style="s2">distraction that we have in today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.289" end="01:58:38.219" style="s2">world I just wanted to get your</p>

<p begin="01:58:43.139" end="01:58:50.789" style="s2">student who&#39;s looking to overcome these</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.179" end="01:58:52.320" style="s2">things well I think with any let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.789" end="01:58:55.320" style="s2">it addictive process</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.320" end="01:58:57.809" style="s2">I mean email is powerfully addictive</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.320" end="01:58:59.670" style="s2">right hardly it&#39;s it&#39;s a slot machine</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.809" end="01:59:02.269" style="s2">and I mean that technically so when you</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.670" end="01:59:04.110" style="s2">pull it&#39;s that&#39;s a variable ratio</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.269" end="01:59:05.940" style="s2">reinforcement schedule if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.110" end="01:59:08.670" style="s2">correctly and it&#39;s very addictive</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.940" end="01:59:11.999" style="s2">because if you pull on the slot machine</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.670" end="01:59:16.590" style="s2">arm enough you will win and you never</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.999" end="01:59:17.940" style="s2">know which poll will reward you and so</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.590" end="01:59:22.889" style="s2">not only is that addictive it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.940" end="01:59:24.300" style="s2">hard to extinguish that and so emails</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.889" end="01:59:25.590" style="s2">like that because there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.300" end="01:59:28.530" style="s2">something beckoning and now and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.590" end="01:59:31.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a jackpot and social medias like</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.530" end="01:59:34.230" style="s2">that because you know people are posting</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.010" end="01:59:35.999" style="s2">interesting things and so well how do</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.230" end="01:59:38.190" style="s2">you overcome an addictive process and</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.999" end="01:59:42.780" style="s2">partly you do it by replacing it with</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.190" end="01:59:44.760" style="s2">something better right so when people</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.780" end="01:59:46.469" style="s2">study drug and alcohol use they they</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.760" end="01:59:48.420" style="s2">often make an elementary mistake which</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.469" end="01:59:51.440" style="s2">is to try to figure out why people use</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.420" end="01:59:54.690" style="s2">drugs and alcohol that&#39;s that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.440" end="01:59:58.909" style="s2">smart thing to wonder we know why people</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.690" end="02:00:01.590" style="s2">use cocaine cocaine directly stimulates</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.909" end="02:00:03.809" style="s2">these systems that produce positive</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.590" end="02:00:05.909" style="s2">emotion it&#39;s like so there&#39;s no mystery</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.809" end="02:00:08.039" style="s2">there the mystery with cocaine is very</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.909" end="02:00:09.449" style="s2">very simple why don&#39;t people take</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.039" end="02:00:11.880" style="s2">cocaine all the time until they die</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.449" end="02:00:14.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the mystery really because you</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.880" end="02:00:17.280" style="s2">can get isolated rats to do that so and</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.610" end="02:00:19.019" style="s2">and for some people alcohol has the same</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.280" end="02:00:21.690" style="s2">kind of effect except it&#39;s mediated by</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.019" end="02:00:22.920" style="s2">opiates but more often what people have</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.690" end="02:00:25.170" style="s2">to do to get themselves out of an</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.920" end="02:00:27.690" style="s2">addictive process is to find something</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.170" end="02:00:29.820" style="s2">better to do to replace it and so I</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.690" end="02:00:31.739" style="s2">would say the problem with the gadgets</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.820" end="02:00:35.429" style="s2">and I mean they&#39;re amazing things is</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.739" end="02:00:37.830" style="s2">that they interfere with they</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.429" end="02:00:40.290" style="s2">proximately interfere with medium to</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.830" end="02:00:41.910" style="s2">long-term goals I would say and so I</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.290" end="02:00:43.770" style="s2">think the first thing you have to do to</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.910" end="02:00:45.900" style="s2">bring them under control is figure out</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.770" end="02:00:47.730" style="s2">what it is that their use is interfering</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.900" end="02:00:49.739" style="s2">with it has to be something important so</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.730" end="02:00:51.390" style="s2">you think well I want to do something</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.739" end="02:00:53.550" style="s2">important what is that</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.390" end="02:00:55.080" style="s2">it could be personal maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.550" end="02:00:57.060" style="s2">have a relationship you want to get</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.080" end="02:00:58.650" style="s2">married you you want to have kids you</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.060" end="02:01:00.360" style="s2">want to have a career that&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.650" end="02:01:02.640" style="s2">you know you wanna have a life you you</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.360" end="02:01:04.380" style="s2">want to have an Abrahamic adventure and</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.640" end="02:01:06.390" style="s2">be the father of Nations let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.380" end="02:01:09.660" style="s2">can&#39;t be ratting away on your cell phone</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.390" end="02:01:12.360" style="s2">in doing that and so I think I think</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.660" end="02:01:15.360" style="s2">part of it is to set your sights high</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.360" end="02:01:18.830" style="s2">and make a plan and figure out who you</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.360" end="02:01:21.570" style="s2">could be and see if obsessive</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.830" end="02:01:24.420" style="s2">utilization of smartphone fits into that</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.570" end="02:01:25.800" style="s2">vision of nobility and it will partly</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.420" end="02:01:28.590" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re unbelievably</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.800" end="02:01:31.560" style="s2">powerful communication devices but so so</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.590" end="02:01:35.280" style="s2">often it&#39;s it&#39;s for lack of something</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.560" end="02:01:38.680" style="s2">better to do and it also interferes so</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.280" end="02:01:44.140" style="s2">that&#39;s about the best I can do with that</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.680" end="02:01:49.160" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.140" end="02:01:50.120" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson so you&#39;ve been you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.160" end="02:01:52.250" style="s2">been talking with some of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.120" end="02:01:54.500" style="s2">conservative candidates for leadership</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.250" end="02:01:56.570" style="s2">this year any you talked with most all</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.500" end="02:01:58.370" style="s2">of them right not all of them but a</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.570" end="02:01:59.690" style="s2">number of them yes you talked with</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.370" end="02:02:02.690" style="s2">Andrew though right yes I did</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.690" end="02:02:05.180" style="s2">yes so so something very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.690" end="02:02:08.810" style="s2">popped up in my Facebook feed so it was</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.180" end="02:02:12.620" style="s2">a ad for the Conservative Party and it</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.810" end="02:02:14.990" style="s2">was suggesting that we thought you cut</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.620" end="02:02:17.150" style="s2">funding to public universities that</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.990" end="02:02:20.210" style="s2">don&#39;t support free speech and yeah that</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.150" end="02:02:21.980" style="s2">was probably my fault yeah see precisely</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.210" end="02:02:24.530" style="s2">because because this is something you</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.980" end="02:02:26.660" style="s2">say in some of your Wilder moments you</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.530" end="02:02:28.970" style="s2">suggest that we should cut the</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.660" end="02:02:31.550" style="s2">university&#39;s funding by 25% and let them</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.970" end="02:02:34.820" style="s2">battle it out for the remains and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.550" end="02:02:37.460" style="s2">taken that you know his his platform but</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.820" end="02:02:38.900" style="s2">now what you&#39;re doing is well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.460" end="02:02:41.330" style="s2">well one of the things you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.900" end="02:02:44.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve created this website that</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.330" end="02:02:47.650" style="s2">identifies the postmodern lexicon and</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.120" end="02:02:49.940" style="s2">helps people distinguish between</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.650" end="02:02:52.100" style="s2">postmodern courses and not and so people</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.940" end="02:02:56.120" style="s2">don&#39;t take them or take them if they</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.100" end="02:02:57.530" style="s2">want yeah yeah so that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.120" end="02:02:59.540" style="s2">would be interesting to know like what</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.530" end="02:03:02.360" style="s2">sort of malevolent postmodernist just</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.540" end="02:03:06.110" style="s2">study you meticulously and try to use</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.360" end="02:03:08.240" style="s2">all your knowledge of it anyway</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.110" end="02:03:10.640" style="s2">so but but what you&#39;ve said though you</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.240" end="02:03:15.470" style="s2">said that what we need to do is starve</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.640" end="02:03:17.690" style="s2">it out from the yeah look so yeah I do I</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.470" end="02:03:19.520" style="s2">know where you&#39;re going so about two</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.690" end="02:03:21.080" style="s2">weeks ago three weeks ago I went up to</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.520" end="02:03:22.550" style="s2">northern Saskatchewan and my parents</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.080" end="02:03:24.250" style="s2">have a cottage up there it&#39;s way the</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.550" end="02:03:26.750" style="s2">hell out in the middle of nowhere and</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.250" end="02:03:28.490" style="s2">there&#39;s no cellphone although we do have</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.750" end="02:03:31.370" style="s2">internet now which is you know probably</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.490" end="02:03:33.080" style="s2">bad and good but anyways I got to take a</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.370" end="02:03:34.790" style="s2">bit of a break which was good because I</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.080" end="02:03:37.580" style="s2">haven&#39;t really been able to think</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.790" end="02:03:39.530" style="s2">because you know more broadly about will</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.580" end="02:03:40.370" style="s2">say what I&#39;m doing cuz who they held I</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.530" end="02:03:43.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.370" end="02:03:46.850" style="s2">exactly this is a this is all very</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.430" end="02:03:48.110" style="s2">strange and but but one thing I thought</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.850" end="02:03:50.510" style="s2">about I was out on the lake I was</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.110" end="02:03:53.600" style="s2">canoeing around and I thought I had</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.510" end="02:03:56.929" style="s2">thought about war you know because I was</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.600" end="02:03:59.110" style="s2">very irritated I&#39;m very irritated about</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.929" end="02:04:01.640" style="s2">what&#39;s happened to the universities and</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.110" end="02:04:03.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a hint of malevolence about it</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.640" end="02:04:08.510" style="s2">and I I&#39;m not a fan of ideological</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.770" end="02:04:10.580" style="s2">possession and I&#39;ve been set back up on</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.510" end="02:04:15.140" style="s2">my heels a lot over the last eight</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.580" end="02:04:17.870" style="s2">months by the the onslaught of what</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.140" end="02:04:22.330" style="s2">emerged when I said that there was words</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.870" end="02:04:25.400" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say and so it&#39;s put me into a</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.330" end="02:04:27.860" style="s2">defensive posture let&#39;s say and I had</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.400" end="02:04:32.330" style="s2">been thinking in terms of war metaphors</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.860" end="02:04:33.800" style="s2">you know like this is a battleground and</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.330" end="02:04:36.290" style="s2">that there&#39;s a war going on an</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.800" end="02:04:41.780" style="s2">ideological war and I do believe that</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.290" end="02:04:43.909" style="s2">that&#39;s true but then I was reading and I</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.780" end="02:04:45.440" style="s2">did this partly for this course I was</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.909" end="02:04:47.000" style="s2">reading the Sermon on the Mount and one</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.440" end="02:04:47.690" style="s2">of the things that says is resist not</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.000" end="02:04:50.030" style="s2">evil</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.690" end="02:04:53.120" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what to make of that</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.030" end="02:04:55.400" style="s2">line and so I was talking to a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.120" end="02:04:56.750" style="s2">people about it and reading about it a</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.400" end="02:04:58.400" style="s2">lot and trying to figure out what it</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.750" end="02:05:01.400" style="s2">meant and partly what it means is don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.400" end="02:05:02.840" style="s2">waste time right because when you</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.400" end="02:05:05.090" style="s2">fighting against something then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.840" end="02:05:06.770" style="s2">something else you&#39;re not doing and then</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.090" end="02:05:07.969" style="s2">I thought also when I was out there on</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.770" end="02:05:09.770" style="s2">the lake I thought well do I really want</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.969" end="02:05:14.500" style="s2">to be in a war because of war that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.770" end="02:05:16.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not that&#39;s not heaven</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.500" end="02:05:17.989" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.159" end="02:05:20.630" style="s2">it&#39;s really stressful and people get</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.989" end="02:05:22.520" style="s2">hurt and so I thought well maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.630" end="02:05:23.900" style="s2">just the wrong way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.520" end="02:05:27.860" style="s2">even though there&#39;s a battleground issue</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.900" end="02:05:30.320" style="s2">here and I thought well wait a second</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.860" end="02:05:32.800" style="s2">maybe maybe the right thing to do in a</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.320" end="02:05:34.760" style="s2">situation like this and this is maybe</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.800" end="02:05:38.719" style="s2">something that those on the alt-right</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.760" end="02:05:41.949" style="s2">might consider is that the right thing</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.719" end="02:05:44.929" style="s2">to do maybe is to outline a better way</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.949" end="02:05:47.480" style="s2">rather than go up directly on the attack</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.929" end="02:05:49.909" style="s2">now that might be seem somewhat at odds</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.480" end="02:05:52.040" style="s2">with my idea of the website and perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.909" end="02:05:54.320" style="s2">it is somewhat a towards without I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.040" end="02:05:57.230" style="s2">not sure about that but what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.320" end="02:06:00.310" style="s2">to do instead of conducting this like a</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.230" end="02:06:03.100" style="s2">war let&#39;s say is to conduct it like a</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.310" end="02:06:05.659" style="s2">movement towards something better and</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.100" end="02:06:07.130" style="s2">and that would be better now with</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.659" end="02:06:08.900" style="s2">regards to cutting the universities</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.130" end="02:06:10.310" style="s2">funding I thought about that too and I</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.900" end="02:06:10.869" style="s2">thought wait a second that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.310" end="02:06:12.729" style="s2">to work out</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.869" end="02:06:14.709" style="s2">because it&#39;s inviting political</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.729" end="02:06:17.169" style="s2">interference into higher education</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.709" end="02:06:19.360" style="s2">now the political interference might be</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.169" end="02:06:20.829" style="s2">of the counterbalancing kind because the</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.360" end="02:06:22.780" style="s2">evidence that the humanities in</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.829" end="02:06:25.059" style="s2">particular have tilted almost a hundred</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.780" end="02:06:28.239" style="s2">percent to the left is overwhelming and</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.059" end="02:06:29.860" style="s2">so maybe some counterbalance from the</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.239" end="02:06:31.239" style="s2">right would set things more towards the</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.860" end="02:06:33.129" style="s2">middle but the problem is is when you</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.239" end="02:06:34.780" style="s2">open up the door to political</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.129" end="02:06:37.059" style="s2">interference with higher education</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.780" end="02:06:41.590" style="s2">content you can&#39;t close the door again</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.059" end="02:06:44.289" style="s2">and so on reflection I thought that it</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.590" end="02:06:46.749" style="s2">probably was a suboptimal idea and that</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.289" end="02:06:47.860" style="s2">would be better instead was to and what</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.749" end="02:06:49.119" style="s2">of this is what I want to do when I</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.860" end="02:06:51.010" style="s2">launch the website I want to ask</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.119" end="02:06:52.179" style="s2">students the students who will be using</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.010" end="02:06:53.769" style="s2">it&#39;s like what do you want from</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.179" end="02:06:55.689" style="s2">university because here&#39;s here&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.769" end="02:06:58.599" style="s2">options you can you can come out</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.689" end="02:07:01.090" style="s2">ideologically possessed right you can</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.599" end="02:07:03.579" style="s2">buy this doctrine this pathological</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.090" end="02:07:05.619" style="s2">doctrine and you can become bitter and</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.579" end="02:07:07.239" style="s2">resentful and you won&#39;t learn to</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.619" end="02:07:09.849" style="s2">communicate properly and you won&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.239" end="02:07:12.249" style="s2">the great works of civilization and you</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.849" end="02:07:17.439" style="s2">won&#39;t learn to think and write you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.249" end="02:07:19.030" style="s2">become Noble in body and spirit is that</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.439" end="02:07:20.590" style="s2">what you want or do you want the</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.030" end="02:07:22.539" style="s2">opposite do you want a real education</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.590" end="02:07:24.219" style="s2">and then I want to explain what that</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.539" end="02:07:26.050" style="s2">means like I did tonight to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.219" end="02:07:27.820" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s absolute value in</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.050" end="02:07:29.559" style="s2">learning how to put yourself together</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.820" end="02:07:32.769" style="s2">and to communicate and to familiarize</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.559" end="02:07:34.449" style="s2">yourself with with with the classic</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.769" end="02:07:36.070" style="s2">works of civilization and I want to</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.449" end="02:07:38.349" style="s2">offer that I want to do what I can to</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.070" end="02:07:40.809" style="s2">offer that as the proper alternative</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.349" end="02:07:43.749" style="s2">instead of staying in sconce tin this</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.809" end="02:07:45.939" style="s2">notion of a battle which is just I just</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.749" end="02:07:48.039" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right metaphor so</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.939" end="02:07:49.360" style="s2">either in dr. Peterson I just want to</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.039" end="02:07:51.820" style="s2">say that I think what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.360" end="02:07:53.919" style="s2">absolutely miraculous it helps change my</p>

<p begin="02:08:02.949" end="02:08:07.119" style="s2">about it&#39;s about 40 people maybe and</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.169" end="02:08:10.149" style="s2">that&#39;s miraculous you know and I think</p>

<p begin="02:09:50.140" end="02:09:53.560" style="s2">all the videos to a bunch of other sites</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.880" end="02:09:56.650" style="s2">and so this isn&#39;t going to happen again</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.560" end="02:09:59.350" style="s2">so but I appreciate that some lectures</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.650" end="02:10:03.100" style="s2">and I do one okay yeah my second comment</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.350" end="02:10:04.720" style="s2">is about sort of kind of going into the</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.100" end="02:10:06.580" style="s2">commentaries of christian theologist</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.720" end="02:10:10.300" style="s2">over the centuries like you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.580" end="02:10:11.890" style="s2">yourself i just would like to encourage</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.300" end="02:10:14.380" style="s2">everybody to also look at not just</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.890" end="02:10:15.940" style="s2">Western Christianity but also Eastern</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.380" end="02:10:17.980" style="s2">Christianity like the Orthodox writings</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.940" end="02:10:21.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a big difference between the two</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.980" end="02:10:24.610" style="s2">and that the Western sort of theology</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.489" end="02:10:26.440" style="s2">comes out of the Roman Roman law Roman</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.610" end="02:10:28.840" style="s2">justice so there&#39;s a lot more of an</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.440" end="02:10:30.490" style="s2">emphasis on cannot justice and Christ</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.840" end="02:10:32.310" style="s2">came he died on the cross bar</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.490" end="02:10:35.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s that look kind of like legal</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.310" end="02:10:41.290" style="s2">payback mmm right whereas the Eastern</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.560" end="02:10:43.360" style="s2">the Eastern theology is a lot more it</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.290" end="02:10:46.210" style="s2">focuses a lot more in love and on sort</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.360" end="02:10:47.770" style="s2">of the the positive aspects and if you</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.210" end="02:10:49.650" style="s2">do read like the first four centuries of</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.770" end="02:10:51.700" style="s2">Christianity where there was no schism</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.650" end="02:10:54.340" style="s2">there&#39;s very little mention of like a</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.700" end="02:10:57.180" style="s2">sort of legalistic framework it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.340" end="02:10:59.470" style="s2">more I don&#39;t know a per se or a more</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.180" end="02:11:01.690" style="s2">heartfelt I guess so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.470" end="02:11:10.360" style="s2">important that we also in the West look</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.690" end="02:11:11.920" style="s2">at the Eastern counterparts had the</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.360" end="02:11:13.210" style="s2">center of this malevolence that you</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.920" end="02:11:15.940" style="s2">mentioned so like you know this whole</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.210" end="02:11:18.190" style="s2">thing about demonizing the opposition</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.940" end="02:11:19.480" style="s2">saying that they&#39;re they&#39;re heartless</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.190" end="02:11:22.240" style="s2">they haven&#39;t all of this and that I</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.480" end="02:11:24.160" style="s2">perceive that as a lot of fake love and</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.240" end="02:11:25.840" style="s2">I think that we have to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.160" end="02:11:28.030" style="s2">what true love is sometimes it looks</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.840" end="02:11:29.890" style="s2">ugly like in dealing with psychiatric</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.030" end="02:11:32.470" style="s2">patients maybe like other countries are</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.890" end="02:11:34.140" style="s2">not as liberal as Canada but the gate</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.470" end="02:11:36.400" style="s2">results are a lot more often you know</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.140" end="02:11:40.120" style="s2">psychiatric patients on on the road for</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.400" end="02:11:41.980" style="s2">example in Greece where I&#39;m from so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.120" end="02:11:43.720" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my comment that we need</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.980" end="02:11:46.180" style="s2">to focus a lot more on what real love is</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.720" end="02:11:48.070" style="s2">I think and not just the the kind of</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.180" end="02:11:49.330" style="s2">love that he can put on a scale because</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.070" end="02:11:51.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t need to keep put love on a scale</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.330" end="02:11:53.680" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been talking and some of you</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.460" end="02:11:55.870" style="s2">know to this guy Jonathan pazzo who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.680" end="02:11:58.150" style="s2">an orthodox Carver and he started a</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.870" end="02:12:00.190" style="s2">YouTube channel and he&#39;s talking a lot</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.150" end="02:12:01.600" style="s2">about Orthodox issues and I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.190" end="02:12:05.530" style="s2">ignorant when it comes to Orthodox</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.600" end="02:12:07.750" style="s2">Christianity but from what I understand</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.530" end="02:12:08.320" style="s2">of it so far there&#39;s plenty to be</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.750" end="02:12:11.770" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.320" end="02:12:13.420" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m Orthodox myself I just</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.770" end="02:12:15.700" style="s2">recently came back to my faith two years</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.420" end="02:12:17.500" style="s2">ago basically that was the original</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.700" end="02:12:20.290" style="s2">Christianity then there was the Schism</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.500" end="02:12:23.140" style="s2">of 1054 between East and West because of</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.290" end="02:12:25.180" style="s2">the the conflicts that these new</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.140" end="02:12:27.370" style="s2">shamanic Christians have with the Pope</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.180" end="02:12:28.750" style="s2">and then after that you also had the</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.370" end="02:12:30.430" style="s2">schism internally within the West</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.750" end="02:12:32.230" style="s2">between Catholicism and and the</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.430" end="02:12:34.030" style="s2">Protestants so that&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.230" end="02:12:36.010" style="s2">big difference said that Christianity</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.030" end="02:12:37.870" style="s2">actually came from the East so I think</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.010" end="02:12:39.430" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s important that we look</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.870" end="02:12:41.080" style="s2">at the most ancient types because those</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.430" end="02:12:45.510" style="s2">were the ones that were closest to the</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.080" end="02:12:45.510" style="s2">original message so not my question</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.470" end="02:12:50.500" style="s2">it&#39;s about atheism back</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.790" end="02:12:52.930" style="s2">you might hear a lot of times people</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.500" end="02:12:56.170" style="s2">criticizing anybody that has any sort of</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.930" end="02:12:57.640" style="s2">belief in a deity or God that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.170" end="02:13:00.610" style="s2">just somebody that has an imaginary</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.640" end="02:13:03.250" style="s2">friend yeah you know like the the</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.610" end="02:13:05.980" style="s2">Heavenly Father that you have to adhere</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.250" end="02:13:08.710" style="s2">to that you have no well of your own you</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.980" end="02:13:11.830" style="s2">know then there&#39;s also like wouldn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.710" end="02:13:12.940" style="s2">contrary argument be that okay so if I</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.830" end="02:13:15.220" style="s2">have a good relationship with my father</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.940" end="02:13:17.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I&#39;m more likely to accept</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.220" end="02:13:20.950" style="s2">a higher deity and I could I be that you</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.650" end="02:13:22.410" style="s2">as an atheist maybe you have conflict</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.950" end="02:13:24.730" style="s2">with your father and that&#39;s why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.410" end="02:13:28.510" style="s2">adverse to kind of submitting to a</p>
<p begin="02:13:24.730" end="02:13:30.600" style="s2">higher being that mechanically is your</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.510" end="02:13:33.370" style="s2">life well you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.600" end="02:13:36.520" style="s2">attempting a psychoanalysis of atheism</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.370" end="02:13:41.350" style="s2">you know and and there&#39;s many factors</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.520" end="02:13:42.970" style="s2">that go into atheism I would say that</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.350" end="02:13:46.150" style="s2">you could make that case in some</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.970" end="02:13:49.120" style="s2">situations but not in all I do think</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.150" end="02:13:50.830" style="s2">though and I think this is perhaps where</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.120" end="02:13:58.470" style="s2">your question is stemming from is that</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.830" end="02:14:01.210" style="s2">it&#39;s no fluke that at the same time that</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.470" end="02:14:03.370" style="s2">one of the consequences of the death of</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.210" end="02:14:06.040" style="s2">God that Nietzsche announced back in the</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.370" end="02:14:08.170" style="s2">late 18-hundreds is the all-out assault</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.040" end="02:14:10.750" style="s2">on masculinity that&#39;s occurring in our</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.170" end="02:14:14.020" style="s2">culture now and those things are</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.750" end="02:14:15.820" style="s2">associated and I do think that does have</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.020" end="02:14:18.370" style="s2">to do with a lack of faith in the</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.820" end="02:14:21.280" style="s2">masculine spirit and that&#39;s a very bad</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.370" end="02:14:24.580" style="s2">thing because that&#39;s a bad thing for</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.280" end="02:14:27.400" style="s2">everyone obviously because women have a</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.580" end="02:14:30.730" style="s2">partially masculine spirit and they have</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.400" end="02:14:33.280" style="s2">to put up with men and so to demolish</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.730" end="02:14:35.530" style="s2">that or to fail to nurture it which is</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.280" end="02:14:42.360" style="s2">certainly what&#39;s occurring is just a</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.530" end="02:14:42.360" style="s2">pathway to absolute disaster so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.449" end="02:14:50.360" style="s2">Peterson so this is the type of question</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.159" end="02:14:52.400" style="s2">that you hate because it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.360" end="02:14:55.159" style="s2">category of white why you believe what</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.400" end="02:14:56.719" style="s2">you believe and it&#39;s a type of question</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.159" end="02:14:58.400" style="s2">that makes you say if I have it right</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.719" end="02:14:59.330" style="s2">from the last time quote what the hell</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.400" end="02:15:02.060" style="s2">makes you think it&#39;s any of your</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.330" end="02:15:04.130" style="s2">business song right okay try to frame it</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.060" end="02:15:05.989" style="s2">properly okay and I&#39;m asking this at</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.130" end="02:15:07.159" style="s2">lecture 10 of 12 and after having</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.989" end="02:15:09.710" style="s2">listened to quite a few hours of you</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.159" end="02:15:11.030" style="s2">here and elsewhere okay and in so in</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.710" end="02:15:12.770" style="s2">your second interview with transluminal</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.030" end="02:15:14.060" style="s2">media you lay out a few things I have</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.770" end="02:15:16.100" style="s2">some quotes here I&#39;ll skip them for</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.060" end="02:15:18.080" style="s2">brevity you get to the point where</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.100" end="02:15:20.270" style="s2">you&#39;re discussing the embodiment of the</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.080" end="02:15:23.000" style="s2">logos by christ as a historical figure</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.270" end="02:15:26.030" style="s2">and then you say quote is this</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.000" end="02:15:29.150" style="s2">resurrection real did his body resurrect</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.030" end="02:15:30.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know in today&#39;s lecture you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.150" end="02:15:32.480" style="s2">alluded to the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.920" end="02:15:34.190" style="s2">states of consciousness that perhaps we</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.480" end="02:15:36.469" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to access anymore and</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.190" end="02:15:37.610" style="s2">let&#39;s say that I&#39;m with you there let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.469" end="02:15:39.140" style="s2">say I&#39;m with the idea that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.610" end="02:15:40.550" style="s2">unknown there are unknown ways to get</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.140" end="02:15:42.800" style="s2">intimations of the divine that the</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.550" end="02:15:45.020" style="s2">embodiment of the logos is associated</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.800" end="02:15:46.400" style="s2">with physiological transformations the</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.020" end="02:15:48.199" style="s2">upper limits of which are unknown and</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.400" end="02:15:50.330" style="s2">that we might currently classify as</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.199" end="02:15:52.820" style="s2">paranormal but to dumb it right back</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.330" end="02:15:54.560" style="s2">down to my level I&#39;m asking about the</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.820" end="02:15:56.390" style="s2">guy commonly depicted with long hair</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.560" end="02:15:58.130" style="s2">nailed to a cross until that is a</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.390" end="02:16:00.140" style="s2">doorknob and all of this goes to the</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.130" end="02:16:02.000" style="s2">heart of the question of literalism and</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.140" end="02:16:03.170" style="s2">religious interpretation it goes to the</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.000" end="02:16:04.580" style="s2">heart of kind of you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.170" end="02:16:06.650" style="s2">doing here at this lecture series are we</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.580" end="02:16:07.760" style="s2">examining the psychological significance</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.650" end="02:16:09.980" style="s2">of these stories or are we entertaining</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.760" end="02:16:11.270" style="s2">the possibility of these fantastical</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.980" end="02:16:13.130" style="s2">events I might be struggling with the</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.270" end="02:16:15.110" style="s2">concept but I haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.130" end="02:16:17.330" style="s2">square away and reconcile those</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.110" end="02:16:18.920" style="s2">statements by you so the question is on</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.330" end="02:16:20.989" style="s2">the on the question of the resurrection</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.920" end="02:16:21.770" style="s2">of Christ why is your answer to your own</p>
<p begin="02:16:20.989" end="02:16:23.510" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.770" end="02:16:26.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know instead of at the very</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.510" end="02:16:26.920" style="s2">least probably not</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.269" end="02:16:43.050" style="s2">well you&#39;re definitely right about me</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.189" end="02:16:45.210" style="s2">hating that question well I called this</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.050" end="02:16:47.219" style="s2">series to psychological significance of</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.210" end="02:16:51.139" style="s2">the biblical stories for a reason you</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.219" end="02:16:53.969" style="s2">know and the reason was that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:17:17.460" end="02:17:22.250" style="s2">what I believe personally it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.490" end="02:17:24.960" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know what I believe I</p>

<p begin="02:17:26.550" end="02:17:33.290" style="s2">strange experiences in it I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.569" end="02:17:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful for me to step outside my</p>

<p begin="02:17:37.040" end="02:17:41.990" style="s2">the easiest thing would be to say I</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.490" end="02:17:47.760" style="s2">think I said what I had to say today I</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.139" end="02:17:51.689" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we know what the upper</p>

<p begin="02:17:57.510" end="02:18:04.800" style="s2">resurrection are complex and difficult</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.399" end="02:18:07.710" style="s2">to understand I think from reading you</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.800" end="02:18:09.719" style="s2">in large part that you can make a very</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.710" end="02:18:11.609" style="s2">strong case for the symbolic meaning of</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.719" end="02:18:13.769" style="s2">the death and resurrection I think it</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.609" end="02:18:16.740" style="s2">does stand for the capacity of the human</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.769" end="02:18:20.760" style="s2">logos to die and resurrect continually</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.740" end="02:18:22.889" style="s2">as it strives upward I&#39;m not willing to</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.760" end="02:18:26.790" style="s2">say that that&#39;s all it means because I</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.889" end="02:18:29.189" style="s2">don&#39;t know what everything means and I</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.790" end="02:18:31.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.189" end="02:18:34.380" style="s2">metaphysics of being like I do believe</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.590" end="02:18:36.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s accurate to construe being as</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.380" end="02:18:38.279" style="s2">a battleground between good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.120" end="02:18:41.069" style="s2">I believe that I believe that is the</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.279" end="02:18:42.870" style="s2">most accurate way of representing being</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.069" end="02:18:44.109" style="s2">it&#39;s not the most accurate way of</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.870" end="02:18:47.139" style="s2">representing the object</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.109" end="02:18:50.050" style="s2">world that&#39;s not the same thing being is</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.139" end="02:18:53.289" style="s2">that set of experiences which we inhabit</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.050" end="02:18:55.389" style="s2">and that&#39;s only partly objective and</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.289" end="02:18:57.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not obviously reducible to the</p>
<p begin="02:18:55.389" end="02:18:59.079" style="s2">material not in any straightforward way</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.099" end="02:19:01.599" style="s2">because we don&#39;t understand the material</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.079" end="02:19:04.090" style="s2">substrate of being at all you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.599" end="02:19:05.529" style="s2">it&#39;s and when we do attempt to</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.090" end="02:19:08.109" style="s2">understand it say at the quantum level</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.529" end="02:19:11.619" style="s2">we run into mysteries that that baffle</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.109" end="02:19:14.499" style="s2">the most the most intelligent of us and</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.619" end="02:19:16.379" style="s2">aware so I&#39;m going to have to leave the</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.499" end="02:19:19.179" style="s2">question hanging but partly because</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.379" end="02:19:24.639" style="s2">partly because I don&#39;t know what I think</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.179" end="02:19:26.909" style="s2">but partly because there has to be a</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.639" end="02:19:30.639" style="s2">line between what I believe and what</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.909" end="02:19:32.559" style="s2">what I can communicate you know what you</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.639" end="02:19:35.289" style="s2">believe is beyond your capacity to</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.559" end="02:19:37.149" style="s2">articulate if you the most the deepest</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.289" end="02:19:39.340" style="s2">levels of belief and I can only share</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.149" end="02:19:41.169" style="s2">with you what I have actually come to</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.340" end="02:19:42.550" style="s2">understand and there&#39;s things that I</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.169" end="02:19:46.239" style="s2">don&#39;t understand and that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.550" end="02:19:48.159" style="s2">one of them I don&#39;t know how to draw a</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.239" end="02:19:51.279" style="s2">line between the symbolic significance</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.159" end="02:19:52.840" style="s2">of the biblical events say the symbolic</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.279" end="02:19:54.819" style="s2">and psychological significance of the</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.840" end="02:19:57.279" style="s2">biblical events and the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.819" end="02:19:59.140" style="s2">that&#39;s underneath them and I think you</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.279" end="02:20:01.629" style="s2">see the same thing in Jung because when</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.140" end="02:20:03.189" style="s2">Jung writes technically and formally he</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.629" end="02:20:05.350" style="s2">never talks about God he always talks</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.189" end="02:20:07.239" style="s2">about the image of God which is not the</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.350" end="02:20:09.699" style="s2">same thing the image of God would be</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.239" end="02:20:11.560" style="s2">your subjective experience of God it</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.699" end="02:20:12.970" style="s2">says nothing about the objective reality</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.560" end="02:20:14.319" style="s2">of God because your subjective</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.970" end="02:20:16.539" style="s2">experience can&#39;t say much about</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.319" end="02:20:19.090" style="s2">objective reality but even in Jung you</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.539" end="02:20:21.310" style="s2">get this mix you know sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.090" end="02:20:23.140" style="s2">psychological but then he he makes a</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.310" end="02:20:25.959" style="s2">metaphysical move and I think that</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.140" end="02:20:27.819" style="s2">reflected also his the limits of his</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.959" end="02:20:29.649" style="s2">knowledge because Jung had profound</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.819" end="02:20:36.550" style="s2">revelatory experiences it was a very</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.649" end="02:20:38.979" style="s2">strange person you know and I I think so</p>
<p begin="02:20:36.550" end="02:20:42.310" style="s2">I think what&#39;s best for me is to stay on</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.979" end="02:20:44.709" style="s2">the ground that I am competent on and to</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.310" end="02:20:47.919" style="s2">say what I can say about the psychology</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.709" end="02:20:49.569" style="s2">and to reach beyond that briefly when</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.919" end="02:20:52.119" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary but other than that to</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.569" end="02:20:55.660" style="s2">leave it to hell alone till I understand</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.119" end="02:21:05.180" style="s2">it better assuming that I ever do so</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.660" end="02:21:06.989" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.180" end="02:21:09.149" style="s2">because of these lectures I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.989" end="02:21:11.000" style="s2">reading the Bible and I&#39;m obviously not</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.149" end="02:21:13.710" style="s2">finished but I&#39;m fairly familiar with</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.000" end="02:21:15.539" style="s2">with how it goes and I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.710" end="02:21:17.840" style="s2">about two parts of it in specific which</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.539" end="02:21:20.340" style="s2">is the story of Isaac and the</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.840" end="02:21:22.770" style="s2">crucifixion of Christ and particularly</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.340" end="02:21:25.920" style="s2">one of the things like that Christ says</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.770" end="02:21:26.970" style="s2">on the cross which is my God my God why</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.920" end="02:21:28.319" style="s2">have you forsaken me</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.970" end="02:21:29.760" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been trying to understand that</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.319" end="02:21:32.250" style="s2">because that&#39;s one hell of a thing for</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.760" end="02:21:34.529" style="s2">the Son of God to say and you think that</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.250" end="02:21:36.689" style="s2">would have been edited out yeah no</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.529" end="02:21:38.699" style="s2">seriously it&#39;s like why isn&#39;t that gone</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.689" end="02:21:39.899" style="s2">you know it it it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.699" end="02:21:43.260" style="s2">inconvenient</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.899" end="02:21:45.119" style="s2">yeah and in well we haven&#39;t you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.260" end="02:21:47.310" style="s2">touched on the story of Isaac yet but</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.119" end="02:21:49.380" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing the cult typology</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.310" end="02:21:51.000" style="s2">which I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of but</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.380" end="02:21:52.140" style="s2">basically the idea that what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.000" end="02:21:54.810" style="s2">in the Old Testament is sort of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.140" end="02:21:56.520" style="s2">laying out of types for Christ and that</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.810" end="02:21:57.989" style="s2">Isaac is essentially a type of Christ</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.520" end="02:22:01.020" style="s2">because they have all these similarities</p>
<p begin="02:21:57.989" end="02:22:03.810" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been thinking about it in</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.020" end="02:22:06.270" style="s2">that context and thinking about the</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.810" end="02:22:07.680" style="s2">parallels between them in between Isaac</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.270" end="02:22:09.510" style="s2">and Christ and one of the things I also</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.680" end="02:22:11.609" style="s2">struck me was mostly the differences</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.510" end="02:22:13.380" style="s2">between Isaac and Christ in the main</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.609" end="02:22:15.810" style="s2">difference it seems to me is sort of a</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.380" end="02:22:17.850" style="s2">difference in direction of sacrifice so</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.810" end="02:22:20.729" style="s2">the sacrifices of Abraham Abraham</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.850" end="02:22:23.310" style="s2">sacrificing his son to God and then the</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.729" end="02:22:26.489" style="s2">sacrifice of Jesus is God sacrificing</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.310" end="02:22:28.829" style="s2">his son to mankind and I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.489" end="02:22:32.399" style="s2">to understand basically how that works</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.829" end="02:22:35.909" style="s2">and in relation to the new and Western</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.399" end="02:22:37.500" style="s2">civilization for 2,000 years yeah well</p>
<p begin="02:22:35.909" end="02:22:40.079" style="s2">there is these transformations of</p>
<p begin="02:22:37.500" end="02:22:43.050" style="s2">sacrifice right that can so the next</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.079" end="02:22:45.539" style="s2">thing that happens in these stories is</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.050" end="02:22:47.520" style="s2">that the circumcision circumcision</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.539" end="02:22:49.770" style="s2">starts to come in as a sacrifice and it</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.520" end="02:22:52.020" style="s2">seems to be something like the</p>
<p begin="02:22:49.770" end="02:22:54.000" style="s2">beginnings of replacement for sacrifice</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.020" end="02:22:56.850" style="s2">of animals it&#39;s you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.000" end="02:22:58.739" style="s2">the psychologize ation of sacrifice so</p>
<p begin="02:22:56.850" end="02:22:59.939" style="s2">first it&#39;s pure external and acted out</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.739" end="02:23:02.609" style="s2">and then it becomes something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.939" end="02:23:04.170" style="s2">more conceptual like it becomes embodied</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.609" end="02:23:06.060" style="s2">in the form of the circumcision and then</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.170" end="02:23:07.529" style="s2">it becomes more conceptual and that</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.060" end="02:23:11.100" style="s2">conceptual transformation keeps</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.529" end="02:23:13.109" style="s2">occurring and and it seems to well it</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.100" end="02:23:15.750" style="s2">culminates to some degree in this idea</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.109" end="02:23:16.710" style="s2">of the sacrifice of Christ who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.750" end="02:23:18.990" style="s2">God</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.710" end="02:23:20.640" style="s2">his son to mankind but the sacrifice is</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.990" end="02:23:23.850" style="s2">much more complex than that right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.640" end="02:23:27.390" style="s2">also Christ sacrificing himself to God</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.850" end="02:23:31.020" style="s2">and and I think that the the issue there</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.390" end="02:23:32.850" style="s2">is something like well let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.020" end="02:23:34.920" style="s2">supposed to offer up the best that you</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.850" end="02:23:36.270" style="s2">have to God that&#39;s the sacrifice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.920" end="02:23:39.330" style="s2">what happens with the high quality</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.270" end="02:23:41.490" style="s2">animals that that Abel sacrifices okay</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.330" end="02:23:44.430" style="s2">but there&#39;s something better than the</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.490" end="02:23:47.220" style="s2">best that you own well what&#39;s that well</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.430" end="02:23:49.350" style="s2">part of it might be well the</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.220" end="02:23:51.300" style="s2">relationships you have with people are</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.350" end="02:23:53.460" style="s2">you willing to sacrifice them to pursue</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.300" end="02:23:56.130" style="s2">the highest good well then are you</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.460" end="02:24:00.720" style="s2">willing to sacrifice yourself or your</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.130" end="02:24:02.520" style="s2">son like your son might be that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.720" end="02:24:05.580" style="s2">tough one I can understand the idea of</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.520" end="02:24:07.140" style="s2">sacrificing yourself better I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.580" end="02:24:08.190" style="s2">wrestling with this story of Isaiah</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.140" end="02:24:09.660" style="s2">obviously because that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.190" end="02:24:11.100" style="s2">complicated story and I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.660" end="02:24:11.940" style="s2">reasonable to think about it as a form</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.100" end="02:24:13.890" style="s2">of foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.940" end="02:24:15.120" style="s2">at least the way the Bible is set up of</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.890" end="02:24:17.900" style="s2">course people who aren&#39;t Christian would</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.120" end="02:24:20.310" style="s2">agree with that but that that&#39;s fine um</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.900" end="02:24:22.680" style="s2">the idea that you would offer yourself</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.310" end="02:24:25.170" style="s2">as a sacrifice to God that seems to me</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.680" end="02:24:27.000" style="s2">to follow quite logically because well</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.170" end="02:24:29.670" style="s2">obviously you have nothing greater to</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.000" end="02:24:31.260" style="s2">give than the best of yourself right so</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.670" end="02:24:33.720" style="s2">you sacrifice yourself to the highest</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.260" end="02:24:35.610" style="s2">good and that&#39;s part of the man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.720" end="02:24:37.560" style="s2">part of the way in which humanity is</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.610" end="02:24:40.260" style="s2">redeemed that makes sense to me that</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.560" end="02:24:41.760" style="s2">just seems like for me that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:40.260" end="02:24:44.790" style="s2">pretty straightforward psychological</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.760" end="02:24:47.070" style="s2">truth the son issue that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.790" end="02:24:48.780" style="s2">tougher thing to wrestle with because</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.070" end="02:24:53.010" style="s2">one of the things I was thinking with</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.780" end="02:24:54.720" style="s2">the with what Jesus says on the cross is</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.010" end="02:24:57.000" style="s2">that one of the interpretations of that</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.720" end="02:24:59.520" style="s2">is basically that Jesus in that moment</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.000" end="02:25:02.760" style="s2">is human basically it&#39;s not this not</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.520" end="02:25:06.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s just Jesus the human right</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.760" end="02:25:08.070" style="s2">but that always kind of felt a little</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.240" end="02:25:09.540" style="s2">bit like avoiding the question to me</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.070" end="02:25:11.010" style="s2">because you can&#39;t just pause it</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.540" end="02:25:13.229" style="s2">something like the Trinity and then say</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.010" end="02:25:17.340" style="s2">oh but in this moment that doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.229" end="02:25:20.280" style="s2">right that doesn&#39;t count so but if we</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.340" end="02:25:22.350" style="s2">think about it in that way of like the</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.280" end="02:25:24.750" style="s2">difference in the direction of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.350" end="02:25:26.550" style="s2">and it seems to me that in the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.750" end="02:25:30.030" style="s2">whoever is making the sacrifice serve</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.550" end="02:25:31.590" style="s2">aims toward something so Abraham is</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.030" end="02:25:33.480" style="s2">so reaching for the divine when he</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.590" end="02:25:37.740" style="s2">sacrifices when he&#39;s going to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.480" end="02:25:40.380" style="s2">his son and so though I mean maybe God</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.740" end="02:25:41.340" style="s2">is reaching toward the human and so that</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.380" end="02:25:43.440" style="s2">would make some sense of that</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.340" end="02:25:45.630" style="s2">interpretation that Christ is only human</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.440" end="02:25:47.460" style="s2">in that moment right that that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.630" end="02:25:50.940" style="s2">sacrifice is accomplished and the</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.460" end="02:25:52.710" style="s2">reaching down is accomplished but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.940" end="02:25:56.190" style="s2">still after a question what do I make of</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.710" end="02:25:58.260" style="s2">that because that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.190" end="02:25:59.550" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s useful to have a problem</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.260" end="02:26:01.800" style="s2">like that because it gives you something</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.550" end="02:26:03.870" style="s2">to think about right and something to</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.800" end="02:26:06.540" style="s2">study further and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.870" end="02:26:08.850" style="s2">a major it&#39;s a major problem I mean the</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.540" end="02:26:10.320" style="s2">whole issue of well we could say well</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.850" end="02:26:12.180" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.320" end="02:26:13.920" style="s2">divine and the human which is obviously</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.180" end="02:26:15.870" style="s2">brought to the forefront and the idea of</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.920" end="02:26:18.270" style="s2">Christ right but it&#39;s a personal issue</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.870" end="02:26:20.340" style="s2">because part of the issue is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:26:18.270" end="02:26:23.760" style="s2">relationship between you as a finite</p>
<p begin="02:26:20.340" end="02:26:25.350" style="s2">entity and the transcendent infinity</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.760" end="02:26:27.900" style="s2">that surrounds you well there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.350" end="02:26:30.030" style="s2">relationship because here you are and</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.900" end="02:26:32.910" style="s2">the transcendent infinity around you</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.030" end="02:26:34.950" style="s2">exists so there&#39;s a relationship the</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.910" end="02:26:37.920" style="s2">question is what is the relationship and</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.950" end="02:26:41.910" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know that and and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:37.920" end="02:26:45.540" style="s2">dramatized in that story and so I mean</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.910" end="02:26:47.820" style="s2">partly the the reason that there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.540" end="02:26:49.200" style="s2">much conflict and confusion in that</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.820" end="02:26:50.730" style="s2">stories because it&#39;s trying to bring</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.200" end="02:26:53.100" style="s2">opposing things together right how can</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.730" end="02:26:55.680" style="s2">something be God and man at the same</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.100" end="02:26:57.930" style="s2">time it&#39;s just like the genie which is</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.680" end="02:27:01.290" style="s2">the root word of genius by the way the</p>
<p begin="02:26:57.930" end="02:27:03.780" style="s2">genie is this incredibly powerful force</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.290" end="02:27:05.490" style="s2">that can grant wishes right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.780" end="02:27:08.310" style="s2">constrained in this tiny little space</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.490" end="02:27:10.680" style="s2">there&#39;s an intimation there that for</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.310" end="02:27:12.660" style="s2">something to be real it has to straddle</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.680" end="02:27:14.880" style="s2">the divide between the finite and the</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.660" end="02:27:16.980" style="s2">infinite and that&#39;s what human beings do</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.880" end="02:27:18.900" style="s2">I think to some degree and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:16.980" end="02:27:20.550" style="s2">dramatized in that story but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.900" end="02:27:23.370" style="s2">mean that we understand it I mean you</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.550" end="02:27:24.810" style="s2">know that sometimes you&#39;re going to feel</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.370" end="02:27:27.140" style="s2">that way when you&#39;re called upon to make</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.810" end="02:27:29.640" style="s2">a sacrifice you&#39;re going to feel that</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.140" end="02:27:30.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve been betrayed by everything I</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.640" end="02:27:33.240" style="s2">mean the story set up that way right</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.990" end="02:27:34.830" style="s2">Christ is betrayed by tyranny he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.240" end="02:27:38.610" style="s2">betrayed by his best friends he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.830" end="02:27:40.230" style="s2">betrayed by his mortality like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.610" end="02:27:42.510" style="s2">archetypal story because and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.230" end="02:27:44.040" style="s2">innocent so the story can&#39;t be any worse</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.510" end="02:27:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s archetypal</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.040" end="02:27:49.680" style="s2">and I mean the story says to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.310" end="02:27:52.170" style="s2">that under such conditions even God</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.680" end="02:27:52.859" style="s2">himself would have dealt it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.170" end="02:27:55.880" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.859" end="02:27:59.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s a real that&#39;s a powerful idea</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.880" end="02:28:09.689" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful idea so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.880" end="02:28:14.729" style="s2">best I can make out of that for now we</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.689" end="02:28:16.130" style="s2">have to stop so will so convene again in</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.729" end="02:28:21.940" style="s2">a week thank you very much</p>
