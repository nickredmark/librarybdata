<p begin="00:01:31.310" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">before and I realized I&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.959" end="00:01:39.889" style="s2">my life from here up and I came to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:41.990" style="s2">realize there wasn&#39;t in the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.889" end="00:01:46.369" style="s2">vast and mysterious as the outer which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.990" end="00:01:48.380" style="s2">had had no idea even existed and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.369" end="00:01:51.409" style="s2">just blown away I felt like I&#39;d live my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.380" end="00:01:53.419" style="s2">entire life on the top six inches of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.409" end="00:01:56.929" style="s2">wave on top of a no inner ocean and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.419" end="00:01:59.719" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know existed and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.929" end="00:02:03.799" style="s2">stunned I mean how could I be so out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.719" end="00:02:05.479" style="s2">touch so unaware of inner experience and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.799" end="00:02:07.579" style="s2">yet as I looked around at the culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.479" end="00:02:11.209" style="s2">seemed like that was the way the culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.579" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">was almost no one was really in touch</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.209" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">with their inner depths or aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:18.849" style="s2">potentials there</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:21.890" style="s2">to us so then I started exploring</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.849" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">multiple practices and traditions in</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.890" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">California which there are many so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:31.610" style="s2">name what I did it sta TM I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">could run through a long list eventually</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.610" end="00:02:36.380" style="s2">I found myself gravitating towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:39.620" style="s2">religious and spiritual traditions and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.380" end="00:02:41.060" style="s2">had no idea why because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.620" end="00:02:44.269" style="s2">religion was the opiate of the masses</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.060" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">and yet I tried some meditation it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.269" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">seemed helpful I tried some yoga it</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:51.700" style="s2">seemed helpful I chanted all seemed</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:54.650" style="s2">helpful and I couldn&#39;t understand why</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.700" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">why did these relics of primitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.650" end="00:03:01.730" style="s2">thinking seem to be beneficial and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:03.319" style="s2">took a couple of years of really</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.730" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">wrestling with it but there&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.319" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">one moment as I was walking across the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">living room floor when I it hit me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:17.090" style="s2">behind the conventional institutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">with their rituals and dogma and much</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.090" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">less well-known set of contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">practices for training the mind to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.700" end="00:03:26.510" style="s2">cultivate the same qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">capacities that the great founders and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.510" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">saints and sages had realized and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.829" style="s2">they also were accompanied by</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">contemporary philosophies and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.829" end="00:03:39.109" style="s2">psychologies which explained how the</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.109" end="00:03:48.650" style="s2">perspectives and how how the mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.340" end="00:03:49.819" style="s2">functioned normally but also in very</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.650" end="00:03:51.709" style="s2">different altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.819" end="00:03:54.049" style="s2">consciousness and at post conventional</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.709" end="00:03:57.709" style="s2">developmental stages so this was just an</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.049" end="00:04:00.230" style="s2">eye open for me and the day after I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.709" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">tenure I applied for two years leave of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.230" end="00:04:04.579" style="s2">absence to disappear into a monastery in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">Asia and in intensive meditation</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.579" end="00:04:11.690" style="s2">practice and have been very fortunate of</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.340" end="00:04:31.850" style="s2">and also look across traditions you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.470" end="00:04:33.650" style="s2">this is the first time in history we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.850" end="00:04:36.020" style="s2">had all the world&#39;s traditions available</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:50.450" style="s2">fascinating I&#39;m curious because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.310" end="00:04:52.370" style="s2">really seen I imagine a lot of changes</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.450" end="00:04:54.260" style="s2">over that time and the way people even</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:04:57.020" style="s2">think about these traditions and these</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">a better word do you think it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:04.130" style="s2">now to bring that into the academic</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">discussion or is it still a challenge or</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">how do you find it well I think both you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">could get excommunicated for saying the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:17.540" style="s2">word spirituality a couple of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:19.639" style="s2">three decades ago now it&#39;s if not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.540" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">acceptable in all circles at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.639" end="00:05:26.260" style="s2">an acceptable thing in some areas such</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">as psychology and in a growing number of</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">of course so it&#39;s getting a little</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:49.669" style="s2">reframe and reconceptualize some of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.590" end="00:06:14.330" style="s2">gnostic in a metre is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.250" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">immersed themselves in a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.330" end="00:06:19.729" style="s2">tradition so deeply that they were able</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:22.550" style="s2">to communicate out of their direct</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.729" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">experience to other people and as far as</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.030" end="00:06:31.970" style="s2">first they immerse themselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.680" end="00:06:36.440" style="s2">tradition to the point that they can</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.970" end="00:06:39.500" style="s2">really have it as a deep part of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">own experience and understand it then</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.500" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">they have to learn the conceptual frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:45.289" style="s2">consistent of the people they want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:48.009" style="s2">communicate to and then they thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.289" end="00:06:50.300" style="s2">they have to translate so as to make the</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.009" end="00:07:03.590" style="s2">basically trying to do that reframe what</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.349" end="00:07:06.889" style="s2">are in some ways archaic terms and</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:18.199" style="s2">because I know you&#39;re that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.099" end="00:07:19.729" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at right now and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.199" end="00:07:22.669" style="s2">course we&#39;re called rebel wisdom so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.729" end="00:07:25.970" style="s2">it&#39;s close to our hearts to you what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.669" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">wisdom mean well I&#39;ve wrestled for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.970" end="00:07:30.229" style="s2">long time trying to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">definition and let me just give a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.229" end="00:07:35.870" style="s2">context in both in both West Western in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:38.300" style="s2">the Western tradition and in some Asian</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.870" end="00:07:40.879" style="s2">traditions for example as in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.300" end="00:07:43.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a common division between two</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.879" end="00:07:45.800" style="s2">types of wisdom one is inside an</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.639" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">understanding and the other is practical</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.800" end="00:07:52.430" style="s2">know-how and so I think I define wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:57.110" style="s2">as wisdom is deep insight and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.430" end="00:08:00.169" style="s2">understanding of oneself and the central</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.110" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">existential issues of life meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.169" end="00:08:08.719" style="s2">purpose Alumnus mortality suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:11.419" style="s2">death plus practical skill in responding</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.719" end="00:08:14.330" style="s2">to these issues effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.419" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">benevolently well we can pause that out</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.330" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">a little if you&#39;d like for example the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.479" end="00:08:23.319" style="s2">wisdom is deep insight and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:26.750" style="s2">in sight both intuitive direct seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.319" end="00:08:29.900" style="s2">and understanding conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.750" end="00:08:31.880" style="s2">understanding of both oneself and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.900" end="00:08:34.130" style="s2">understanding can be at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.880" end="00:08:36.709" style="s2">of course from just seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.130" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">particular habits I have and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.709" end="00:08:43.880" style="s2">so smart to seeing some of the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">of the mind to seeing very deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.880" end="00:08:49.579" style="s2">the deeper nature of ourselves so called</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:51.380" style="s2">transcendent wisdom when India would</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.579" end="00:08:55.310" style="s2">called progerin your honor</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.380" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">that direct seeing into what can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.310" end="00:09:02.090" style="s2">interpreted your consciousness being God</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:03.380" style="s2">different names so those are the D</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.090" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the deep insight and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.380" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">understanding of where himself and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:08.710" style="s2">also deep inside an understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:11.570" style="s2">central existential issues of life</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.710" end="00:09:13.970" style="s2">issues that all of us have to face and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.570" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">wrestle with simply because we&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.970" end="00:09:19.370" style="s2">and come with a body which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:21.470" style="s2">sicken an age and die and we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.370" end="00:09:23.780" style="s2">challenged with how to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.470" end="00:09:26.060" style="s2">skillfully as we can to others how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.780" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">deal with the inevitable issues that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">life presents us with so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.630" style="s2">those are existential issues they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:34.970" style="s2">part of existence they&#39;re not just</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.970" end="00:09:41.450" style="s2">come with being in a body so deep inside</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.230" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">and understanding both oneself from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.450" end="00:09:47.390" style="s2">central existential issues of life plus</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:50.690" style="s2">practical skill you&#39;d be able to respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.390" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">effectively that is skilfully</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.690" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">effectively to handle situations and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:59.180" style="s2">benevolently because there&#39;s agreement</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:10:01.270" style="s2">across multiple traditions that wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.180" end="00:10:06.080" style="s2">is intimately linked with benevolence</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.270" end="00:10:08.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not just if if a person is acting</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.080" end="00:10:13.430" style="s2">out of mere self-interest that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.810" end="00:10:16.940" style="s2">enough benevolence altruism seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.430" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">inextricably linked with wisdom and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.940" end="00:10:26.300" style="s2">fact wisdom confers a profound a radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:29.750" style="s2">understanding of virtues because from</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.300" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">the perspective of the wise the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.750" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">are simply the ways of living that makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:36.530" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:37.570" style="s2">if a person who sees deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.530" end="00:10:40.400" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.570" end="00:10:43.400" style="s2">recognizing recognizes their deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.400" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">transpersonal nature and recognizes it</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:47.390" style="s2">in others of course they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">ethical that person deserves no less</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.390" end="00:10:50.960" style="s2">than that of course they want to be</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">that ourselves so that gives a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.110" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">different understanding of virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.570" end="00:11:05.089" style="s2">so when I think when a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:07.779" style="s2">look out the window they see or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.089" end="00:11:10.910" style="s2">lots of us here very tribal eyes very</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.779" end="00:11:12.199" style="s2">chaotic political and cultural landscape</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:15.110" style="s2">do you think there&#39;s any relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.199" end="00:11:19.689" style="s2">between wisdom and or maybe lack of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.110" end="00:11:22.970" style="s2">wisdom and that well sure I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.689" end="00:11:27.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no question that most of us are</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.970" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">living way below our potential and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.559" end="00:11:32.779" style="s2">you ask a group of people for example to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:35.509" style="s2">talk or perhaps if you asked your</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.779" end="00:11:38.509" style="s2">audience where on the average is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.509" end="00:11:42.769" style="s2">humankind in its journey from infancy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.509" end="00:11:44.779" style="s2">adolescence through maturity through old</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.769" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">age most people will say adolescence I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.779" end="00:11:51.559" style="s2">think that speaks to a intuitive insight</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:55.420" style="s2">on the part of the majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.559" end="00:11:58.819" style="s2">that we are not functioning at our best</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.420" end="00:12:02.870" style="s2">that and it&#39;s becoming clearer and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.819" end="00:12:05.240" style="s2">clearer from both adult developmental</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.870" end="00:12:07.550" style="s2">psychology which is a remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.240" end="00:12:09.319" style="s2">important field which is I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.550" end="00:12:11.269" style="s2">the most exciting discoveries of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.319" end="00:12:14.569" style="s2">psychology in the last few decades that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.269" end="00:12:16.579" style="s2">what we took to be normality is not the</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.579" end="00:12:21.649" style="s2">stages of development which people have</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.649" end="00:12:24.319" style="s2">now beginning to map out through post</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.319" end="00:12:30.139" style="s2">stages yet if yet though only a small</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.730" end="00:12:31.870" style="s2">percentage of the people are operating</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.139" end="00:12:34.999" style="s2">at those levels and who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.870" end="00:12:38.149" style="s2">possibilities there are beyond that so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.999" end="00:12:41.749" style="s2">if most people are operating way below</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.149" end="00:12:43.490" style="s2">their potential with as Abraham Maslow</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.749" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">with a great humanistic psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.490" end="00:12:47.779" style="s2">said you know what we call normality is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:50.689" style="s2">really a form of form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.779" end="00:12:52.610" style="s2">pathology and I would frame it is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.689" end="00:12:56.059" style="s2">we call normality is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.610" end="00:12:58.100" style="s2">collective developmental arrest and once</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.059" end="00:13:01.639" style="s2">you see that then you can see that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.100" end="00:13:03.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not surprising that we have so many</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.639" end="00:13:06.769" style="s2">social and global problems not to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.620" end="00:13:09.829" style="s2">mention the fact of course that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.769" end="00:13:11.929" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with entirely new eras and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.829" end="00:13:13.939" style="s2">levels of complexity and innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.929" end="00:13:15.649" style="s2">change and so forth we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.939" end="00:13:18.740" style="s2">guidelines we&#39;re kind of thrown into</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.649" end="00:13:18.950" style="s2">this and trying to make our way so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.740" end="00:13:21.769" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.950" end="00:13:24.200" style="s2">desperate need for fostering</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.420" end="00:13:31.130" style="s2">and others so as someone who&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.420" end="00:13:33.350" style="s2">delved into many different traditions</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.130" end="00:13:33.829" style="s2">I&#39;m written very well about many of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.350" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.829" end="00:13:37.490" style="s2">where would you suggest someone begin if</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">they want to start tapping into their</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.490" end="00:13:41.779" style="s2">potential more fully and kind of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:44.360" style="s2">say gaining more wisdom well I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.779" end="00:13:46.670" style="s2">obviously it depends on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.360" end="00:13:48.500" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a little hard to to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.670" end="00:13:52.190" style="s2">general recommendations but we can cover</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.500" end="00:13:54.949" style="s2">a variety of spectra possibilities first</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.190" end="00:13:57.620" style="s2">of all you know I spent three years</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.949" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">writing this book essential spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.620" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">of some central practices and three</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">years studying the different traditions</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:05.209" style="s2">and what they say about cultivating</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:13.100" style="s2">surprised me most was that every single</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.519" end="00:14:15.500" style="s2">tradition said that for every single</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.100" end="00:14:17.449" style="s2">virtue if you want to develop this</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.500" end="00:14:20.690" style="s2">virtue on yourself hang out with people</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.449" end="00:14:21.610" style="s2">who have it you know consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.690" end="00:14:25.910" style="s2">catchy</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.610" end="00:14:27.829" style="s2">and the what of a theme that has been</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:43.570" style="s2">draws us and it may be appropriate just</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.760" end="00:16:46.850" style="s2">say a little bit about the the</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.460" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">Sunday maybe our church and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.140" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">let&#39;s see what feels good into some</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:12.620" style="s2">stage you may feel drawn and may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">perfectly appropriate to dive very</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.620" end="00:17:18.710" style="s2">deeply into one practice or one</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:21.650" style="s2">tradition and that can be very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.710" end="00:17:24.950" style="s2">to focus to really immerse oneself and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.650" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">to dedicate oneself to a particular</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:30.920" style="s2">and they feel you getting a little stale</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.030" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">and would benefit from the exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.920" end="00:17:36.560" style="s2">something else so so there&#39;s a rhythm to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">psychological work and spiritual growth</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.560" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">then we CH have to tune in and trust our</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:44.390" style="s2">own intuitive feelings about this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">curious as well about how how that might</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.390" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">on the more collective level when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.810" style="s2">come together because this is something</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:53.300" style="s2">we&#39;re very interested in a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.810" end="00:17:54.740" style="s2">events we you know we might bring up a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.300" end="00:17:57.380" style="s2">cultural issue but then encourage people</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.740" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">to enter into an inquiry around that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">maybe not from a kind of place of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.350" style="s2">telling a story or here&#39;s my opinion but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.060" style="s2">really a kind of an inquiry like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.350" end="00:18:07.250" style="s2">talking meditation on this into thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.060" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">okay what does this really bring up for</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.250" end="00:18:13.850" style="s2">me and thinking a deeper level so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:15.080" style="s2">very curious about what what some of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.850" end="00:18:17.390" style="s2">traditions have said or your experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.080" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">in the best ways for us to come together</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.390" end="00:18:21.020" style="s2">in that way what we used to do all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">time in church but we don&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.020" end="00:18:25.940" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:29.320" style="s2">yes and the significant research of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.940" end="00:18:31.460" style="s2">course showing that communities groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.320" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">interpersonal contact has gone down</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.460" end="00:18:36.260" style="s2">dramatically since particularly some</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:37.970" style="s2">screen time decreased so much so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.260" end="00:18:40.340" style="s2">this is one of the issues of our time</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.970" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">how how we can foster community and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.340" end="00:18:45.920" style="s2">particularly how we can foster</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">communities that that serve both our</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.920" end="00:18:51.920" style="s2">individual and collective healing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.100" end="00:18:54.310" style="s2">growth in various ways and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.920" end="00:18:57.350" style="s2">know you&#39;re exploring various</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">possibilities and and I think a number</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.350" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">of people are I think you think this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:07.400" style="s2">a kind of cutting edge work so again it</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:09.890" style="s2">feels like know what particular approach</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.400" end="00:19:13.790" style="s2">are we drawn to some people are drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.890" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">again to more contemplative inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.790" end="00:19:18.950" style="s2">together kind of one extreme would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:21.290" style="s2">the Quaker movement where there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.950" end="00:19:23.990" style="s2">of emphasis on silence listening and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.290" end="00:19:27.110" style="s2">then speaking from the spirit and when</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.990" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">called another ism at the other extremes</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.110" end="00:19:33.620" style="s2">a more active inquiries dialogue even in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:36.710" style="s2">some traditions debate challenging</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.620" end="00:19:39.580" style="s2">debate Tibetan Buddhism Judaism for</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.710" end="00:19:43.750" style="s2">example they really go at it as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.580" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">trying to try to carve away faulty</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.750" end="00:19:51.890" style="s2">presuppositions which much hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:55.340" style="s2">in ourselves now this and and so even</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.890" end="00:19:57.290" style="s2">that kind of very active debate if done</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.340" end="00:19:58.429" style="s2">for the purpose and here&#39;s the crucial</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">thing what</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.429" end="00:20:02.809" style="s2">the purpose of these things is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:05.240" style="s2">purpose what was traditionally called</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.809" end="00:20:08.929" style="s2">heuristic where I&#39;m trying to prove my</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.240" end="00:20:12.769" style="s2">point or is it more Socratic a shared</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.929" end="00:20:15.169" style="s2">inquiry for truth which may probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.769" end="00:20:18.529" style="s2">eludes us both but together perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.169" end="00:20:20.419" style="s2">get a little closer so one of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.529" end="00:20:22.730" style="s2">of hot topics in our culture right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.419" end="00:20:24.619" style="s2">is a relationship between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.730" end="00:20:26.210" style="s2">I probably a relationship is old as time</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.619" end="00:20:27.559" style="s2">and it certainly seems now you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.210" end="00:20:28.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve referred to it as it looks very</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.559" end="00:20:31.580" style="s2">much like a dysfunctional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.549" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">in the culture and many people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.580" end="00:20:35.570" style="s2">looking at you know how do we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:38.119" style="s2">heal that relationship um as a</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.119" end="00:20:44.600" style="s2">that I have a lot of thoughts but so do</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.789" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">a lot of other people yes it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.600" end="00:20:49.759" style="s2">challenging time and it&#39;s reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">the larger social situation a larger</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.549" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">so people had very clear directions</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.769" end="00:21:19.779" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t such a demand for for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:23.990" style="s2">autonomy for finding one&#39;s own role and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.779" end="00:21:25.820" style="s2">at the same time we have the social</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.990" end="00:21:28.730" style="s2">structures including power structures</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.820" end="00:21:31.279" style="s2">being called into question broken up and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.730" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">in some ways very healthy we have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.279" end="00:21:35.269" style="s2">meat to move like people women now able</p>
