<p begin="00:00:03.060" end="00:00:09.240" style="s2">get this idea that some people&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">say you know on the right even you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.240" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">liberalism or libertarianism is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">failure of our culture this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">individual rights or my individualism</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">and autonomous individuals and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">to myself wait a second libertarians</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">don&#39;t have any power that&#39;s not their</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">fault but what they are getting at is</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">that is this this weird relationship</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">between a cultures individualism and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">rise of tyranny it&#39;s this weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">how it works together if you have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">individualist mindset somehow we get or</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:43.829" style="s2">more collectivist and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:46.620" style="s2">expansive than our government right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">beautiful well I think it goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.620" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really a two or three step</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">process you feel a wrongness in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">world right and it&#39;s in its and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:01:00.539" style="s2">it&#39;s a felt sense right first and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:02.230" style="s2">foremost is the felt sense second you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.539" end="00:01:05.500" style="s2">can&#39;t fix it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.230" end="00:01:07.720" style="s2">you yourself and by you I mean yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.500" end="00:01:10.300" style="s2">and the the real and the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.720" end="00:01:13.310" style="s2">that you can count on don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.300" end="00:01:16.370" style="s2">able to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.310" end="00:01:19.100" style="s2">now what do you do typically what we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.370" end="00:01:21.380" style="s2">is we escape one place you can get to as</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.100" end="00:01:23.990" style="s2">you can you can deny the problem you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.380" end="00:01:27.500" style="s2">make up a story that points the blame at</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.990" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">something and renders you virtuous and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.500" end="00:01:30.770" style="s2">those are the two moves right the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">move is you find something which is vice</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.770" end="00:01:34.040" style="s2">you pointing the blame at something and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.740" style="s2">the second thing is you render yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.040" end="00:01:39.290" style="s2">virtuous some Volks escaped into</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.740" end="00:01:41.780" style="s2">libertarianism and they point to point</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.290" end="00:01:44.500" style="s2">to blame it thorat Arianism or at</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.780" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">collectivism you&#39;ve it is an ism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.500" end="00:01:50.630" style="s2">renders themselves virtuous the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:53.660" style="s2">autonomous no individual some folks</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.630" end="00:01:55.160" style="s2">escape into social justice and then they</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.660" end="00:01:57.770" style="s2">point the blame at fill-in-the-blank and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.160" end="00:01:59.330" style="s2">always render themselves virtuous that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.770" end="00:02:01.300" style="s2">not that&#39;s the third move right the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.330" end="00:02:04.460" style="s2">first move is there is a felt wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.300" end="00:02:07.160" style="s2">second move is you feel powerless the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.460" end="00:02:08.660" style="s2">third move is you escape now the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.160" end="00:02:10.280" style="s2">is if you&#39;re sitting in that third move</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.660" end="00:02:12.050" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.280" end="00:02:13.910" style="s2">solve things from the third position</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.050" end="00:02:14.989" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna reinforce the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.910" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">position because the third position</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.989" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">can&#39;t solve anything it only makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">things worse and all and the worst part</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:22.430" style="s2">is it makes things worse in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:23.540" style="s2">actually creates simple categories for</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.430" end="00:02:25.489" style="s2">other people start dividing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.540" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">conquering oh I&#39;m a libertarian and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.489" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">social justice folks are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:30.019" style="s2">collectivists so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">collectivist in principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.019" end="00:02:33.739" style="s2">collectivist in practice by the way they</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:34.910" style="s2">don&#39;t like me they&#39;re certainly they</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.739" end="00:02:36.350" style="s2">yell at me a lot they point the finger</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.910" end="00:02:38.120" style="s2">they seem really mean and angry and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.350" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">sometimes they even punch me so now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:42.410" style="s2">got a real out reality that&#39;s now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">the force move there&#39;s a reality that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.410" end="00:02:45.290" style="s2">in fact really real which increases the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:46.970" style="s2">reality of the wrongness but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.290" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">actually tied to the third which was</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.970" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">never real in the first place which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">tied to the second which is real real</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">and all the way to the first right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:53.989" style="s2">this you get real lost and get confused</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:55.730" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.989" end="00:02:57.350" style="s2">you can see it like surging through</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.730" end="00:02:59.269" style="s2">social media you just sort of step back</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.350" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">and watch social media that lends you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.269" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">keep seeing people who are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:06.500" style="s2">powerless fundamentally feel powerless</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">so they keep making up stories to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:10.579" style="s2">feel somewhat agenting and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">mistake their stories for reality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.579" end="00:03:15.989" style="s2">become actually powerless</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s the site again it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.989" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">to when you&#39;re in a stagnant universe at</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">least you feel that way and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">grow the pie the only thing you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">do is to turn to your neighbors say well</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">it&#39;s the choices you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:33.330" style="s2">it&#39;s your race it&#39;s your gender it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">your ideology which is causing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.330" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">suffering in the world you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">quarantined with all guilt quarantined</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">on to you you need to quarantine all</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">guilt onto you and cut it off that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the scapegoat mechanism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">still dry happen it&#39;s nice you know this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">other place is right you could put it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.359" style="s2">this into the stone on the ground right</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">I think everybody&#39;s had that experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.359" end="00:03:59.099" style="s2">as a child and stubbing your toe on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.599" style="s2">stone and blaming the stone now first</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.099" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">and foremost so stay in particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.599" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a very nice simple simple example</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to be too highfalutin right</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">walking along and I stub my toe in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">stone what happens well I feel pain and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:14.160" style="s2">and the consequence the cause is in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">past can&#39;t change it I am in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.160" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">actually powerless so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">uncomfortable and I&#39;m actually powerless</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">so now I have a choice what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">well the energy the energy of pain is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">energy of change and I want to change</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:28.470" style="s2">what happened but I can&#39;t because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">in the past so one of the things I might</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.470" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">do is I might blame something I could</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">blame myself that&#39;s uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:39.450" style="s2">I could also blame the stone it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the metaphor for the gospel</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">transformation and the Bible scandal on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:45.450" style="s2">the stumbling block that you&#39;ve stumble</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">on to in the field and that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.450" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">the scandal that that causes either</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:54.599" style="s2">mimetic rivalry because what&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">Peter confronts Jesus and he says you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.599" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">not gonna die on the cross we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.340" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">do were the one where the 99 we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">go beat the 1% okay it&#39;s time to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:05.099" style="s2">the revolution Jesus you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">movement here your poll numbers are good</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.099" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">let&#39;s storm the castle</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">and Jesus says get behind me Satan which</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">means get behind me accuser you are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.080" end="00:05:17.340" style="s2">stumbling block to me so you&#39;re a stone</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:19.620" style="s2">that I&#39;ve stubbed my toe on you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.340" end="00:05:22.349" style="s2">trying to draw me into doing things the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.620" end="00:05:24.570" style="s2">way of that scarcity mindset that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.349" end="00:05:26.070" style="s2">right that&#39;s right that&#39;s that&#39;s a real</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.070" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">silly a thing to say that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">insight yeah yeah it&#39;s a real insight I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:35.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s a crucial Landa right cuz</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:38.460" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy you can&#39;t help it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.220" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">you kick the stone there&#39;s a whole lot</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">should do is kick I stumble on this day</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">maybe maybe I should just kick this down</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">maybe the stone got in the way and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:49.590" style="s2">even harder because you have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">this that the first thing you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.590" end="00:05:55.530" style="s2">is you have to recognize that the pain</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.820" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">profane and to slow down take a breath</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">look at your toe is it painter is it</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.630" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">change my capacity to move forward in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">the world if no then it&#39;s in the past it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:39.930" style="s2">is simply a part of reality that happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:41.640" style="s2">to occur if yes then let&#39;s grow in that</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.100" end="00:06:53.190" style="s2">what happens they allow the crying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.930" end="00:06:55.380" style="s2">pass this room without getting too hung</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.190" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">up on blaming anybody and they figure</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.380" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">out how to get better and you know you</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.390" end="00:07:04.350" style="s2">about blaming anybody it&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:07.980" style="s2">pretty good ancillary to that particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.350" end="00:07:09.300" style="s2">rule yeah the kingdom of God is like</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.760" end="00:07:26.020" style="s2">something else I think that&#39;s a picture</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.310" end="00:07:38.340" style="s2">which has a feeling of feeling a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.410" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">theoretical but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.340" end="00:07:42.990" style="s2">I was living in the in the native</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">language and and yet you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.990" end="00:07:48.210" style="s2">sitting in my my chair using a computer</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.210" end="00:07:53.220" style="s2">infrastructure and you&#39;re at a makeshift</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:56.310" style="s2">version of a boot because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.220" end="00:07:58.050" style="s2">quarantined right voluntary quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.310" end="00:07:59.370" style="s2">at least on my part I suppose in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.050" end="00:08:02.750" style="s2">sense it&#39;s always volunteer and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.370" end="00:08:02.750" style="s2">important to recognize right</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.069" end="00:08:08.749" style="s2">but things are things are afoot</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.610" end="00:08:11.330" style="s2">normality is definitely not going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.749" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">outside I think I was yesterday with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.330" end="00:08:14.629" style="s2">Pentagon had that whole aliens thing and</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.830" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">weirdest out these days so I&#39;d like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.099" end="00:08:25.369" style="s2">to invite people to accept the reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:27.740" style="s2">of the signs and the reality that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.369" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">can actually look around and go oh this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.740" end="00:08:32.300" style="s2">is that thing this is the telling us</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:33.829" style="s2">that we&#39;re right now in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.300" end="00:08:36.649" style="s2">making a real big choice and whether we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.829" end="00:08:38.930" style="s2">spiral down into the inevitable spiral</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.649" end="00:08:43.459" style="s2">of mimetic desire into conflict in decay</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.930" end="00:08:46.250" style="s2">Oz into terror or we take this this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.459" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">stumbling block and we stumble up and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.250" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">acknowledge oh that&#39;s right I have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.649" style="s2">remember the difference in the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.130" end="00:08:53.329" style="s2">and the profane and I have to to return</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.649" end="00:08:54.980" style="s2">back to the past before I do anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.329" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">else and how do I proceed forward in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.980" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">this space more deeply in the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:03.579" style="s2">than I was before and find all those who</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:06.170" style="s2">would be friends you know in the and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.579" end="00:09:07.670" style="s2">Quaker sense and the Society of Friends</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.170" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">the Society of those who agree to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.670" end="00:09:11.329" style="s2">support each other in maintaining their</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.649" end="00:09:12.889" style="s2">individual and collective integrity in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.329" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">the shared space of peace and grace and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.889" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">the sacred and then build from there</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:20.810" style="s2">right because that group that group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:22.430" style="s2">people you know a group of people enter</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.810" end="00:09:24.829" style="s2">into an agreement around that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.430" end="00:09:26.269" style="s2">shared directionality is the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.829" end="00:09:28.130" style="s2">possible way out of this mess right</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.269" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to get there by pointing</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.130" end="00:09:31.819" style="s2">fingers and we&#39;re not going to get there</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">by having a boss tell us what to do I</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.819" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">don&#39;t if you&#39;ve noticed they&#39;re not very</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:37.370" style="s2">and we&#39;re not going to get there by</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.690" end="00:09:39.620" style="s2">blaming the boss either yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.370" end="00:09:41.690" style="s2">right that&#39;s the revolutionary counter</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.620" end="00:09:43.910" style="s2">spear that imitates the spirit of the</p>
