<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">the stoa is a digital campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:08.800" style="s2">cohere</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and dialogue about what matters most at</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.800" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">so as i mentioned in um the email when i</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.439" end="00:00:29.199" style="s2">reached out to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:31.119" style="s2">is that uh i organized a stoic group</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.199" end="00:00:32.719" style="s2">here in in toronto and then we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.119" end="00:00:33.920" style="s2">meet in person so i launched this kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">of online</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.920" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">stoic uh presence called the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">and one theme that is popping up right</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:44.559" style="s2">now is death</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">and so i thought of you obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.559" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">a fellow canadian and former torontonian</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">um so i guess maybe i&#39;ll just start with</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">this uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">this quote that from plato that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.160" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">from mind and then i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">see how it lands for you um i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:02.719" style="s2">other people do not realize that the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">aim of those who practice philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">in the proper manner is to practice for</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">death and dying</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">but without it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can&#39;t really achieve very</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:21.920" style="s2">much i would say</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">you know use the word gravitas a minute</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">it&#39;s where we get our adjective grave of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">course and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">we misapprehend grave it means profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean quote serious or it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">you know the absence of humor or a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">regard for beauty or</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">it simply means your capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">grateful for being alive</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">is rooted in the deep abiding</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">and ongoing understanding that soon</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">enough you won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t pull that off you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not a tightrope act it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">mingling</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">if you can&#39;t pull that off you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">not a grown-up</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">that&#39;s it i mean it doesn&#39;t sound very</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">tolerant</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">it isn&#39;t very tolerant you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">tolerance is for people who got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">but in a time like this the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">that you get to have your you know your</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">own take on what it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">to possibly possibly die</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">no it&#39;s not possible it&#39;s one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">givens of your life i can tell you this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">i i used to be the death guy although</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">your association with me and my face is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">that but i&#39;ve i i seem to have moved on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">to certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">in some people&#39;s mind but but uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">when i was i saw pretty routinely</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">the idea that people proceeded as if</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">they knew they were going to die</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">if you were to ask them of course and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">you raised the contemplation to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">to the level of something deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">okay a very handy example so i&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">room full of people i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">and apropos apparently have nothing i</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">ask them how many people in this room</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">know they&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">well you know the predisposition of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">audience and so on would be that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">virtually every hand would go up</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">i would have to say how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">this second order awareness right a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">subtler thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">if i asked you if you&#39;re alert to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">you&#39;d say yes but if i ask you what does</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">it do to your days</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">ah this is a much different question and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">the chances are very good</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">that it does virtually nothing to most</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">people who have their hand up</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">so a good parallel to that would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">i mean you&#39;re too young to remember this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">people were lining up at the gas pumps</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">particularly in the united states and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">fist fighting for position</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">in the lineup because there was an oil</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">shortage it was very temporary</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">right and it was an aberration</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">if you had to ask people in those days</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">is there enough oil in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">for everybody yes or no they would have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">said yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">and how could you tell they believed</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">there was enough oil and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">by how they lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">and how they purchased right and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">they oriented themselves and decisions</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">they made every morning and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">how far away from work they lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">i mean it went on and on and on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">how you could tell that people knew</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">there was enough oil now the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t enough oil there was never</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">enough oil but i didn&#39;t say if it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">i said the people know it people know</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">there was enough and the answer is yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">so if you take out the word oil and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">put in the word dying</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">into the exact same scenario</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">how can you tell that people know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">they&#39;re dying and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t and i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">sort of dominant culture in north</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">america and the reason you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">is because the word no</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">means something it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">it means there&#39;s a there&#39;s a level</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">at which your life is ongoingly informed</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">by this thing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">you know how to breathe and you do so at</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">least most of us most of us know how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">walk around and we do so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">most of us know where we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">go to work at least until recently</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">and we do so that&#39;s how you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">that the knowledge is there</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">but the knowledge of dying leaves no</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">trace</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">in north america because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">knowledge it&#39;s suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s fear it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">idle curiosity but as a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">known sort of existential</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">information it&#39;s not a known thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">and this is why i last why i had a job</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">that was my job security</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">is it was predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">understanding that nobody knew that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">were going to die</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">virtually nobody knew and i can</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">i can show you to the cows come home</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">examples of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">people who uh who came to their dying</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">either shocked or feeling abused</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">or feeling you know uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">mishandled or mistreated by life</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">because the inevitable and the given</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">finally</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">came to call well if you knew you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">going to die</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">where does the sense of grievance about</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">dying come from</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">and more often than not people look</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">shocked you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">and finally take this notion about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">sudden death which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">often the objection that was raised to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">my stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">was yeah but this is all very useful if</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">you see your death coming from a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">way off which is hilarious because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">people who did</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">see their death coming from a long way</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">off didn&#39;t thank me i can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">but the people who who imagined that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">somehow sudden death is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">different animal</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">obviously i&#39;ve never died and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">misapprehend this thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">if we know that we&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing sudden about dying</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">is there because the word sudden means</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">not that you didn&#39;t know it was today</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t know at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">sudden death is a confession that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">about truancy</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">about sudden death</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">as a shock as something somehow is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">beneath your dignity or has no mercy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">in actual fact there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">sudden death</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">not no such thing whatsoever that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">dereliction of duty</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">to imagine that there&#39;s a thing called</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">sudden death your death is a given</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s an ongoing reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">and the amazing thing about these days</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">is when we watch older people and old</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">folks home die in their dozens</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">suddenly suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">we imagine that this is a visitation</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">from some darker place</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">and where does the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">dark death come from from the sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">that we don&#39;t get a vote i mean most</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">north americans are addicted</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">so so terminally</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">to self-direction that anything like</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:49.279" style="s2">what we&#39;re going through now</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">the idea that you have to stay at home</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.279" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">punishment or as a kind of arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">whimsical invasion into the natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">order of things it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">it really speaks to how thin our</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">understanding of our daily life actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">and our capacity to live it in any deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">sort of way</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">very very compromised and and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">that&#39;s really what today</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">these days are for is glimpsing</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">in the act of being shocked by things</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">though unprecedented completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">predictable</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">what&#39;s coming up is um</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">you know you know that quote i read in</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">the beginning and then a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">exercises that stoics and whatever do</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">it could be these cute cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">intellectual exercises like okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">you know you you&#39;ll you know you&#39;ll die</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">right whatever and everyone puts their</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">hand up</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">but then um there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">knowing in an intellectual sense and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">actually feeling it and having like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">emotional relationship or emotional</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">knowingness</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">um and i wonder how you cultivate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">like you personally how you cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">that and how do other people cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">well first of all not many people seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">to cultivate it so you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">talking about a rare thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">but this is this is why it&#39;s so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">i say that out loud in response to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure people listening say dude</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">that&#39;s way overstated</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">well first of all you didn&#39;t follow me</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">around from day to day when i worked in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">the death trade</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not overstated i have no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">exaggerate this dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">right i&#39;m not getting paid more for</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">anything i do</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">by virtue of lamenting on this level</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">about this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">rare</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">to find people who are informed by their</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">you see so let&#39;s use the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">small b</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">buddhist who when when</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">encouraged to contemplate these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">will come up with this nugget</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">which they deem to be helpful to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">oh everybody&#39;s dying all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">see as soon as i say that there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">of involuntary new age</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">peace to all all of us that just start</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">yes yes we&#39;re all dying all that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">sounds right</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">in a bizarre way it feels right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">it must be right</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">and so we&#39;re just dying all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">so this is great news because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">dying all the time there&#39;s nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s just happening all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">not to each not to various people in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">population no to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">everyone in some kind of regular</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">uh patterned fashion</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">really so if that&#39;s true then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">such thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">really as the terminal diagnosis it</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">it&#39;s just another day at the office</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">so so you don&#39;t believe anything changes</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">as a consequence of becoming symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">okay so you know what i&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">from this first of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">there is a reality called dying and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">a different reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">from when you&#39;re not dying and though i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything about your</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">you know your personal health</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">circumstances i&#39;ll bet anything you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">but the skillfulness is not a coping</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">is an ability you have an ability</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">given what you were led into during the</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">into the natural order of things no</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">this is what the greeks meant by the</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">which we get demon right okay so we we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">generic kind of fairy tale-ish kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">which we might call uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.440" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">um oh man i just blanked on the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">not fairy godmother but a guardian angel</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">like this kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">and you can tell by the characterization</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">that it&#39;s very benign and it&#39;s to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">extent it&#39;s very welcome</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">but angel the the greek word angel</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">simply meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">messenger it had nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">benign had nothing to do with beneficent</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">or none of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">it simply meant a bringer of news</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">and the word daemon from which we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">blumen</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">was virtually the same thing the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">daemon</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">was something that was born when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">were born</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">uh that has um typically followed you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">around town</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">that has more or less faithfully</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">answered the bell answered the call</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.639" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">every time you didn&#39;t and the one who</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">will be there</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">sitting at the end of your bed on your</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">dying day</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">and leaning in very gently and asking</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">inquiring whether or not you have any</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the one who was born when</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">you were born who seems to know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">a little better than you&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">inclined</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">so and if you think of the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">meaning of the words now or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">associations with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">angel and demon we&#39;re at pains to keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">them apart</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">in hopes that an angel means is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">but good</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">and can offset the presence of something</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">quote demonic</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">right you know but all this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">misapprehends the the language</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">and misapprehends the old understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s what you&#39;re dying is among</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">other things is your</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">demon not your personal name</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">but the one who&#39;s who will not let you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">who will not mistake you for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">or have too much to drink and follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">somebody else home hmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">yeah this is um yeah it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">strange because we just met like like</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">like like one minute we pressed records</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">the first time i met you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">and anyone who knows me i talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">damon all the time i was</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">actually writing about it in the journal</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">um you know socrates he</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">used used his daemon as a kiting spirit</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">and that i like the idea like eudemonia</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s a good relationship with your</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">daemon</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">um and ever since this this covet thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s so complex this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">chaotic i can&#39;t i couldn&#39;t think right i</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">i just basically handed the keys over to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">damon and i just feel quite alive and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">just energetic about this right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">and i like this idea of building a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">relationship with your demon</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">and just kind of emancipating at other</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">people&#39;s demons</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">so they can build a relationship with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">as well i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">the correct phrasing of it but yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">curious what you think about that how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">build a really really good relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">with your demon well i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">that the best expression is to call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">demon the reason i&#39;m hesitant is because</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">the language of personal possession in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">anglo-north america</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">right and the truth is it&#39;s not your</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">this is a it&#39;s a kind of you could call</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">house deity you could call it a domestic</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">deity in the old days</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">when there were no central houses of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">worship</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s quite clear in the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">mediterranean that every house had an</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">altar</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">and that the head of the household was</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">basically the the priest</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">of the household and it was responsible</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">administrations and so on you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">damon as a kind of residual memory a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">kind of vestigial memory of a time</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">when every house was responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">its deities and the ancestors were</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">buried under the floor</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">i mean just to give the fullness to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">circumstance right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">and so with that in mind how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">cultivate it well</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">i mean the first order business i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">is the same way</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">we would do if we weren&#39;t able to share</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">english readily</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">and we were intending to do something</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">deep and abiding and maybe useful to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">and i had enough time to prepare and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">spoke french</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">then my responsibility to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">would be to learn enough french to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">see that&#39;s cultivating a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">you learn the language</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">of what you claim to hold in high regard</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">so then is it possible that the daemon</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">has a language</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">of course it is maybe not a language in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">quite the way you and i are using</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">english at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">but this is a hint um</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">i came to dying very in a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">way i came to realize that dying was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">the death was a god and then when death</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">comes in the room you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you harm but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">certainly means you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">and so if you have a god suddenly in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">your house</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">i mean the first order of business is do</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">you exercise the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">radical hospitality right the greeks</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">all about hospitality i mean in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">they have remarkable range of vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">to denote different kinds of hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">and there was one you exercise for</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">people that you knew that you were bound</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">to by blood</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">that kind of kinship and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">different kind of hospitality that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">exercised</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t know you and there&#39;s another kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">that ends the formalities of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">hospitality so that it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:45.919" style="s2">the in the tundra</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">or a drift on an iceberg that&#39;s a go amy</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.919" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">so i come to it this way</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">i saw a lot of people to death&#39;s door</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">lots of them hundreds and hundreds uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">this can really inform you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re lucky it can traumatize you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have much good fortune and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re not working pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">one of the things i saw routinely</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">was people thrashing about for something</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">that they more or less called</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">meaning the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">they had to find it like it was this</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">kind of scavenger hunt</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">in actual fact meaning is made</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not found it&#39;s made and by made i</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">arbitrarily i mean through enormous</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">layers and levels of of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">arduous focus and devotion and so on</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">meaning is made</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">here&#39;s a good example we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">the english word true or truth</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">right now it&#39;s not an english word in</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">the word itself is english but our</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">understanding of it is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">so just bear with me for a minute a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">little bit of a etymological history</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">lesson here</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">so the word toyan is an old english word</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">but it never meant what we use it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">mean today</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">there&#39;s the irony the vocabulary is old</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">english</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">but the syntactical</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">meaning of the word is latin it&#39;s roman</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">okay now the roman word is veritas as</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">you probably know</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">i went to a school that has that as its</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">what logo i guess you would call it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">and we take it to mean you know going</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">all the way back to the people that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">think you&#39;re enamored of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">and uh beyond we take it to mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">some kind of enduring unchanging</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">indwelling formless uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">you can count on it pretty solid that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s in its uh in juris</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">prudence it&#39;s a very important concept</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">you know the truth the truth will set</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">you free you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">and so on well the word</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">true signified the following</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">for people who use the word the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">ancestors of this language i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">to you in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">meant this by it true was a verb</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t an adjective and it was never</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">a noun</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">it was something you did it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">something you had or you owned or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">or you held or you gave from one person</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">to the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">it was a verb it was an activity</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">it was a kind of collective discernment</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">and and the form that it took is people</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">with real standing in the village or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">community or the clan or</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">the tribe tended to be older people of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">they had a name that&#39;s where the old</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">understanding comes from their name</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even theirs it was given to them</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">as an acknowledgement of the work</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve done the service the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">achievements and so on</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">and their name would change periodically</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">through their lives</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">properly so as you do already you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">beginning to get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">that your standing in the community</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">changes and it changes your name</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">so somehow what your life</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">begins to mean is being attested</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">and attributed by others not by you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as self made</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">in other words we have this word</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">automaton</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">right i said two greek words which</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">literally means to be mothered</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">by yourself which would from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">from a genetic point of view and other</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">points of view</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">probably be the principal</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">obscenity that you could imagine to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">self-mothered</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">to push your mother and all that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">mothering out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to assume the ability</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">to take this</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">upon yourself so these people would</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">to a given something they would</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">something particularly in times of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">like the time we&#39;re in and these old</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">people&#39;s willingness to put their status</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">in the community</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">on the line by declaring themselves in</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">was assigned to the rest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">because these people were truly you see</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">and the only vestige of this that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">survives us today</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">is of all places is in carpentry</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">there are things in carpentry called</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">truing sticks most people don&#39;t use them</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">but it worked like this if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">long piece of wood and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">make a level plane</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t just trust your eye running</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">down 8 or 12 or 15 feet of wood</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">to work out the various what you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">do is you take two sticks</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">that were exactly the same proportion</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">and you&#39;d lay one let&#39;s say 10 feet away</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the top lines or</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">of these two small pieces of wood and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">you&#39;re checking their alignment</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">these two sticks are telling you about</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">the movement of the wood across</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">time see and across space these are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">called truing sticks</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s who elders are in a living</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">and their status on the line</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">probably attests to how quote</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">true what they&#39;re saying is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">the currency that people went with</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">so all of that is simply me suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.159" style="s2">that the meaning of your life is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">something that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">cobble together the meaning of your life</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">is attributed to you by others you see</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">and and in dying more than any other</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">time of life it becomes very apparent</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">that you are not you&#39;re not exercising</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">of course the root word of authority is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">the one who writes it down</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">right so that&#39;s not what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">to do what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:44.880" style="s2">is you&#39;re entrusting the meaning of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">life to others</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">as you have done involuntarily during</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">the course of your life</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:53.279" style="s2">now you basically have no other choice</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">and now you realize</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.279" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">what a um awake is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">awake is the time at which for the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:06.399" style="s2">at the cessation of your life your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">life&#39;s meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">begins to gather momentum and gravitas</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">and consequence and presence</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">people begin to attest to it they lie to</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">a certain extent about the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">your life because the lies about you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">are as true as the true things about you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">and somewhere in there you begin to gain</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">some kind of status in people&#39;s memories</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">and they begin to refer to you in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">various ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you come to mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">something you see so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">the meaning of your life is not your</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">intention the meaning of your life</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">is granted to you by others</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">that&#39;s how you begin to make peace with</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">and you practice doing that by</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">participating</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">in the cobbling together of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">of other people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">in the wake of their dying music</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">which is to say then that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">death before your own</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">is your chance to get it right to get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">phd in the way it really is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">and the degree to which you stay away</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">from the dying of other people for all</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">kinds of crazy reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">is the degree to which you will come to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">your own death</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">as an amateur and as a rookie and as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">beginner</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a good time you know to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">have that status</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:31.039" style="s2">case in point a woman comes up to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">at the end of some talk i did years ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.039" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">and she&#39;s in her mid-50s probably she</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">says well that&#39;s really good you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">and everything but it&#39;s not that useful</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">i said she said yeah really because</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">nobody close to me has died</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">and i did i thought to myself it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">clear she doesn&#39;t realize that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">confessing</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">to me right now and what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">confessing is this and it&#39;s sad</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">she&#39;s saying she&#39;s lived her life in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">such a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">as to have kept people at a distance of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">course people have been dying around her</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">but she&#39;s moderated the consequence by</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">keeping her distance from them</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">so alas it&#39;s true nobody close to her</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">has died can you imagine what her dying</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">would be like</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">so two competing questions are coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">one is you know the inquiry about</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">why we are not collectively practicing</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">this skill</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">and the other one is how do we get to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">practice this skill but then it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">of being</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">like a more immediate question is coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">to mind um about the present moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">and your take on it this whole pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">and the crisis that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">well i&#39;ll come to the thing you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">quite ask first</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">and and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.770" end="00:35:10.889" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">if you can hear me stephen your uh video</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">has just frozen</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">yeah there we go is that good again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">okay uh lord oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">what i was saying in is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">language is the way by which we approach</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">it&#39;s the way by which the world becomes</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">available accessible</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">present consequential to us</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">so the first order of business always</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:50.079" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">is you attend to the language that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing to bear</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">upon the thing you&#39;ve identified as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">problem you see</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">the language will never let you down</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re faithful to it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">it sounds strange to tell a grown-up</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">that you have to learn the language</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">because most people are offended by that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">they think they know it quite well</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">but i can tell you my stock and trade is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">language that&#39;s all i really have</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the only skillfulness i seem to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">be lucky enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking about it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">more important than that i&#39;m practicing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not just talking i&#39;m practicing</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">wonder by exercising</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">the language out at it&#39;s the limit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">see so i&#39;m not saying to you something</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve said a thousand times before</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">in other kinds of interviews i&#39;m not i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to approach the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">that you&#39;re asking me about with</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">in the very circumstance we find</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">every time you know i&#39;m asked to do so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">so i i take that to be a moral</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">obligation not a circus trick</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">see so the act of wondering</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">is the linguistic function first and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">foremost</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">here&#39;s what i mean by that i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">five seconds</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">this is a bit of a joke but just see if</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">you can play along with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">see it think of a thought you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">thought before</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">go okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:39.320" style="s2">why because</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">because it can&#39;t come to you as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.320" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">generated thing it comes to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">mediated to you by language that you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">right but you might have to rearrange</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">the language</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">and the new arrangement that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">able to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">somehow gives you another track to begin</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">to wonder and to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">but it&#39;s the rearrangement of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">language that comes first</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">so what comes first developmentally for</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">is it seeing or is it saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">virtually everyone would say seeing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">comes first and eventually the language</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">catches up</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing you have a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">difficult time remembering</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">stuff from your very early life why do</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">you suppose that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">because they know that developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">speech acquisition and memory retention</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">wow that&#39;s there&#39;s some real magic there</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">you realize that it&#39;s your language</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">that&#39;s giving you your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">remember things so you speak your way</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">towards the thing that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">recall</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve done it a million times you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to say something</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">i forget how it went and then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">somehow you find a bit of a thread you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">say three words and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">bang the whole association is there</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">and you have recall right</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">and of course recall is a verbal</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">it means to summon or to plead for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">presence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">again that&#39;s what recall means we use</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">that as a synonym for memory</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">okay with that in mind i would</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">then say what you hear me trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">is practice something that i it&#39;s trick</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">i learned from meditation people i</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">should say</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know anything about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve never done it</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">i probably secretly envy the people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">do do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">but i don&#39;t envy them enough to learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">how to do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">so there you go but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">that they found a way to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">is to take something they were going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">be doing anyway</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">and elevate it to a devotional degree</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">and the something in question was</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">breathing</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing observation they take</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">the most ordinary and mundane of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">of detail and turn it into an object</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">object of real contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">in the act of doing it so they bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">their breath you understand what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">saying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">to the level of real alertness and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">employ the breath</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">to wonder and to try to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.599" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">achieve a degree of presentness and all</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">i do that with speaking i&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">realize this about myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m a kind of late blooming</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">meditation practitioner when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">language yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what you hear me doing now so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">irony is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">50 minutes into an interview somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">will say to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">so so how do we come to a different</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">understanding about</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">well let&#39;s say dying and i say dude i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">just been talking about that for</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">fifth minute and now you&#39;re asking me</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">for some kind of magic answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">right or magic bullet you see yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">so with that in mind let me see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">stumble</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">towards what&#39;s quote happening now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">you know i&#39;m looking out the window at</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">melt water that&#39;s increasing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">by a third again the river right in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">front of my farm here</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">it looks the same as yesterday but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a little more water than it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">in the farm in the field behind me</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">the first twins were born sheep i should</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">and this is the beginning of new life</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">here on the farm</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a spectacularly beautiful day</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">which is very good for my solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.000" style="s2">and uh as soon as we&#39;re finished i have</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">to go prepare</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.000" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">a wood pile for transfer to dry out for</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">next year just in case things get really</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">hairy</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">okay so what am i saying i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">at many many levels things are unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">exactly as they do at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">april in the northern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not an insignificant thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">at a time like this okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not pretending that almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">everything&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">but the meaning of everything is seems</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">to be scattered</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">a lot of things a lot of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">order is proceeding more or less</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">as it must because it&#39;s calendrically</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">faithful</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">in a way that we don&#39;t know how to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">okay so the epidemiologists quote know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">that there was a province if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">they call them in china</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a province and inside the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">province in china there was a city</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">and inside that city there was a market</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">and inside that market there was an area</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">they called a wet market and inside that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">zone</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">they had been in cages domestic animals</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">and wild animals given their insane and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">indefensible penchant</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">for the exotic to put in their mouths to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:16.319" style="s2">augment their</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">for virility or fertility whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.319" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">hell it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">and if that&#39;s as far as you go with</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of in the in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:29.839" style="s2">alleged</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">principal causes but you&#39;ve missed</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.839" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">something fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:35.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s the it&#39;s that little</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">architecture of the wild</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.119" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">being brought into obscene proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.800" style="s2">the domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">and we know that the virus leapt across</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.800" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">that chasm</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">from the wild animal to the domestic</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">animal and subsequently to the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">who handled the animal to sell or to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">butcher and to sell</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">and subsequently to those who ate it</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">okay so so the the lesson to be learned</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">and the thing to be understood is</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">this is a direct consequence of humans</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">going</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">some moral order</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">it comes from an understanding that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">wild can only be wild to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">we stay</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">out of it we have the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">particularly in our numbers</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">and particularly with our technologies</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">to to obviate the wild</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">every time we go the wild retreats</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">you see that&#39;s what it does and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">people in their</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">wild ayahuasca you know fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">that they&#39;re one with the wild and all</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">this crazy shit</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">if you investigate you know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">to these people on these magical mystery</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">rides</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">one of the things that becomes clear is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">the wild is absolutely overwhelming to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lesson to be learned there</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not going back</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">to the wild we&#39;ve never been there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">not our home</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly too many of us and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">going to all kinds of places we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">belong and our lack of belonging has now</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">scorpions tale-wise up from behind us</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">and is killing us in two or three days</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">after we&#39;re exposed</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">at least if you&#39;re my age or we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">predisposing circumstances and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">so this is a kind of moral play that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">unfolding before us</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">yeah right that&#39;s what it is we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">paying the price of exercising a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">dominion</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">the responsibility for which we cannot</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">we have no capacity to live there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">very clear parallel for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">to the death trait when i was working in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">the death trade</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">we had a kind of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">medicinal arsenal</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">that if you really knew what they could</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">do to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">you&#39;d be un unnerved and overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">it to be honest with you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">we can overcome overwhelm and overturn</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">almost virtually every bodily function</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">we can do it mechanically or we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">it drug induced wise</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">my point in telling you this is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">we have a kind of uh technological</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">innovation that is forever</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">leaping ahead of itself right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">outgrowing itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">so exponentially that nobody certainly</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">not the physicians</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">can keep track of it in the old days</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">this is what they used to resort to they</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.319" style="s2">had medical</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">technological innovation yes but they</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:54.839" style="s2">had a kind of practice</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">wisdom that would guide the use of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.839" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">and temper the consequences and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">resorting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">the innovation now</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">being tempered and being being held back</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">by practice wisdom that&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">suckers game</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">that&#39;s for old people and people your</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">age and younger than you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">look upon something like that as an</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">limit on what could be virtually</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">limitless possibilities and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">giddiness that ensues from that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:32.559" style="s2">when everything is bright and sunny the</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.559" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">is very welcome this is no different</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking at now is all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">consequences of innovation minus the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">regulating function</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">of practice wisdom which is derived from</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">from previous practice and so on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">accumulative you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">and the problem now is anybody my age</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:00.800" style="s2">is basically thrown on the trash heap of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">insignificance by people in their 20s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.800" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">why because the the gadgetry</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s enabling you and i to speak right</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">now is something that&#39;s designed for</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t care less whether i agree</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">playground i should say i guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">and all of that is just to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">that when you decide to go it alone</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">and you decide experience is another</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">agree to or to submit yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">be not surprised that there are</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">is not in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">a kind of moral failing of humans this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">that comes from our lack of practice of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">any kind of initiatory</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">um you know culture</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">with alarming frequency right and uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:29.760" style="s2">you know the notion of of wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">personally safe</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.760" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">i mean i wrote a book and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">chapter in there called uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">oh my god i&#39;m blanking on the name of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">the chapter but the the notion is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">that um that there there&#39;s no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">as safety and that&#39;s what grown-ups know</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">and the clamoring after personal safety</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">or a safe space all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">is a sign that you don&#39;t really need</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">the idea that i wondered about many</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">was not so much what&#39;s to become of us</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">or but what has become of us and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">one of the points i made is you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">there&#39;s an oracle</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">by the highway as you enter or leave a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">you you can if you look for it you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">see it it&#39;s an oracle</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a masquerading as a highway sign</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">what does it say</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">it says be prepared to stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">that&#39;s an oracle you see and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">look we&#39;ve already clicked past being</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">prepared to stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">and now be prepared to be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">has become the new world order</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">and we have been stopped</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">and i think the crime</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">the indefensible crime will be</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">to resume right standard broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">practice right that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">that&#39;ll be so unspeakably obscene</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">and it&#39;ll look so non-eventful to do so</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">in actual fact we have no obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">resume the life that we had</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">two or three weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re about to say something um</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:27.560" style="s2">um present moment but but something</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">that was quite salient for me and</p>

<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it was what you were</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">saying or how you were saying it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">just really snapped me into a different</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">um and this idea of the way i hold like</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">truth versus truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.799" style="s2">um like truth is like use the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">philosophical term the correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.799" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">theory of truth</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">if your model of reality maps over to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">reality and it&#39;s accurate then you got</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">and you can replicate it scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">and then blah blah people memorize it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">institutions and repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">that&#39;s different than and truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">is that&#39;s what i&#39;m holding what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">where you&#39;re just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">constantly mapping your words to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">present moment your experience your</p>

<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">and then you&#39;re in flow um with reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">with god</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">uh and you have a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">daemon when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">accurately and assuming that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">and if people become unfaithful to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">to being truthful that truthfulness then</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">they become</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">deceased you know then the disease the</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">um and so that this kind of connection</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:33.839" style="s2">just hit me when you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">talked about the way you&#39;re truthful</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.839" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">with the present state of this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:39.760" style="s2">and then the relationship between the</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">you know i knew this propositionally and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">i try to practice my truthfulness as</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">best i can</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">but it seems um the ethical obligation</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">for me to do so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">and model it and help encourage other</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">people to do it just got heightened</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">in that moment yeah it was amen</p>

<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">means nobody no good and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">cults look like cults by definition tend</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">to be one generation wide</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">right right okay so we have a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">farm here</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:26.799" style="s2">and we got let me see</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">well we got three generations living on</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.799" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">the farm all at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not an experiment it&#39;s as old as</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">the hills</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">right and we&#39;re just lucky enough that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">deciding to live this way in close</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">proximity to each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">stumbling about in the dark trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">that&#39;s all it is and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">lucky enough to have it</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">and to be reminded of these things</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">constantly by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">simply of the presence of somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">not your generation</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:01.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not placing all of the onus for</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">being wise upon older people by saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.520" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">this i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">i&#39;m saying it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the miracle</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">of the juxtaposition of the generations</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">that produce the capacity to see things</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">for what they are</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">the extent to which you keep them apart</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">is the extent to which we become</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">inaccessible to each other and finally</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">the world itself</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">becomes a a kind of savage</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">uh withholding kind of unkindness</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">to us as if because the the world is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">orchestrated to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">satisfy us then it&#39;s by definition</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">hostile</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">right so if you watch other generations</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">engaging with this thing just as you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">reported as a consequence of the way i</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">was saying a certain something</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">things can change man right</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">and well i mean there&#39;s no way to sum</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">any of this stuff up and i know we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">the end of our time</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m not going to try to sum it up but</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">what that the time comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">that some people remember this time</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">as as a time when things fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:13.040" style="s2">did change i know that&#39;s the language</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">that&#39;s being used right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.040" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">but the change has not occurred change</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">has been forced upon us at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not a change the change will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">when the force is removed and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">willingness to live differently</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">remains</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">and what i&#39;m leaving with um</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">is sort of like the question how to find</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">the elders well i found one right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">on the zoom chat um and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">jordan peterson comes to mind how</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">everyone just gravitated to him as the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">father figure of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">internet type thing uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">yeah yeah fellow trontonian um</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">he was my therapist actually for two</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">years before he became</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">super famous so it was interesting just</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">to see his rise and everyone just kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">attracted to him um and just the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">thing i&#39;m leaving with is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">returning back to that truthfulness is</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">um it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s hard being truthful in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">circumstances because there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">sacrificing when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:15.599" style="s2">being truthful you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">constantly sacrificing something to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.599" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">comfort your ego whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:20.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the thought that just came</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">up is like if you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.880" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">consistently reliably</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">then it&#39;s like there&#39;s a readiness there</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">for for death</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.359" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">there&#39;s an ability i&#39;m not sure the word</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">ready is the most useful word to use</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s still shocking look man</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:39.760" style="s2">this the shit is still crazy making</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">it is right but what what i&#39;m advocating</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.760" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">is the idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:45.760" style="s2">that if you attend enough deaths before</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.760" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">then there&#39;s something about dying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:52.450" style="s2">not that it&#39;s familiar</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s not lethal</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.450" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not any more lethal than the day</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re born i mean it&#39;s a rough</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">ride</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">right okay and it&#39;s a rough ride to die</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">whether it&#39;s fast or slow it&#39;s a rough</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">ride</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to do it more or less</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">alone and the good news is</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:16.240" style="s2">that there is a kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">that&#39;s been established by the people</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.240" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">who died before you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">and the deaths prior to your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">establish your ancestry</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:29.119" style="s2">and the indigenous part of you is</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:31.599" style="s2">vaguely hip to the understanding</p>
