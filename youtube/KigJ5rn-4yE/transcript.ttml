<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">suspended but others are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">kick in and there is a general sense in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">our culture that things are coming apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">and that sense that things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">apart have people looking for a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">higher ground that will involve</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">tribalism and will involve people doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">things that violate the values they</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">believe they hold and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">you either can move forward to kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.910" end="00:02:25.950" style="s2">more global perspective like we are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">connected in some way or you can regress</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.950" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s progress or regress back to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">know centric tribalism and obviously as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">we Teeter on this brink of saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">the problems we face these days are no</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:37.020" style="s2">longer national they don&#39;t stop at</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">central awareness but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:51.240" style="s2">transitional period - and just one more</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">metaphor and mix it a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.240" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">being a soft-shell crab</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve left the confining shell</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">of nationalism and tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">we are absolutely vulnerable in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">transition and people are you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.850" style="s2">there&#39;s not necessarily a clear voice of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">leadership to get us all through that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.850" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">transition and into the more expansive</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">container of we are all in this together</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">so you have a lot of demagogues right</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">and a lot of kind of so-called populism</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:18.630" style="s2">saying come back into the old shells you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:21.630" style="s2">know divide rather than unite and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.630" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">would just add that one thing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.630" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">once you realize that that pattern is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:29.580" style="s2">there is recognized that where this ends</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:33.420" style="s2">is not good unless we intervene so in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">other words this pattern of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.420" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">abundance abundance leads to certain</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.350" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">contraction and austerity and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">results in a kind of tribalism this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">oscillation is going to kill us the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">solution to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">the solution to it involves architecting</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:04:00.989" style="s2">a stable a steady state that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">the inputs of abundance in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.989" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2">does not oscillate between boom and bust</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">if you can create it looks like a world</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:15.300" style="s2">in which people have enough they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">the sense that things are getting better</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.300" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">because you&#39;ve architected them to give</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">people that sense of breadth in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">words maybe you have shifted growth into</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">a different mode in other words if</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:31.940" style="s2">everybody is freed to be generative so</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:33.980" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly encountering new</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.940" end="00:04:36.290" style="s2">interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.980" end="00:04:37.730" style="s2">that feels like the world of abundance</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.290" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">that happens when you&#39;ve just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.730" end="00:04:42.500" style="s2">some concentrated source of growth</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.970" style="s2">it may not be predicated on growth and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:45.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the point is we&#39;re not in a</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.890" end="00:04:50.030" style="s2">growth so if we can substitute things</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">that feel like growth then we will put</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.030" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">people into their growth mindset as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:04:57.560" style="s2">were and then they can&#39;t afford and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.640" style="s2">will naturally be inclined to be decent</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:00.980" style="s2">to each other what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.640" end="00:05:02.330" style="s2">seems you know beautiful possible but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.980" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">wildly ambitious and we take a hell of a</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:06.430" style="s2">like you are you talking about like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:09.800" style="s2">fundamental retooling of socio-economic</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:16.580" style="s2">all to the point where people like oh</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.580" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">afford to be kind we can afford to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">inclusive I&#39;m talking about a process</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:23.780" style="s2">that will take three generations at</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">least okay do we have that much time</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.780" end="00:05:29.510" style="s2">well let&#39;s put it this way you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.110" end="00:05:32.900" style="s2">need to solve the entire problem at once</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.510" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">you need to forestall the existential</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.290" end="00:05:44.090" style="s2">we have to wake up to those things that</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.090" end="00:05:49.460" style="s2">addressing them that does not have to</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.730" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">tribalism that is setting in so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.410" end="00:06:05.510" style="s2">question is how do we get enough people</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">to have a post global experience in</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.320" end="00:06:13.880" style="s2">can think of is either one independence</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.900" end="00:06:16.250" style="s2">day level stuff the discovery of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.880" end="00:06:17.870" style="s2">life something that really wakes us up</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.250" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">to the fact that we are here together on</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.369" end="00:09:12.549" style="s2">little subtle but if you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.209" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">different spellings for a particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.549" end="00:09:17.259" style="s2">let&#39;s say a respiratory enzyme and let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.259" end="00:09:21.100" style="s2">better in you than in me it&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.939" end="00:09:22.899" style="s2">percent more efficient my respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.100" end="00:09:25.179" style="s2">enzyme still wants your respiratory</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.179" end="00:09:29.319" style="s2">care about the function it cares that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.889" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">that spelling is advanced and your</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.319" end="00:09:33.369" style="s2">spelling is in conflict with my spelling</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:36.429" style="s2">as long as yours is around there will be</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.429" end="00:09:41.829" style="s2">actually interested I mean that if I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:43.540" style="s2">just be clear about it the mindfuck of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.829" end="00:09:45.639" style="s2">the whole thing is that the entire</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.639" end="00:09:51.999" style="s2">is the cosmic spelling bee and it ends</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.939" end="00:09:54.699" style="s2">in genocide right once you realize that</p>

<p begin="00:10:01.509" end="00:10:04.600" style="s2">like these we can afford to be decent to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.610" end="00:10:06.459" style="s2">each other but if things were different</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.600" end="00:10:08.860" style="s2">one of us would be putting the other in</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.860" end="00:10:11.919" style="s2">that and neither do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.610" end="00:10:14.169" style="s2">so when people realize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.919" end="00:10:15.699" style="s2">really what they are they are built to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.169" end="00:10:17.439" style="s2">be nice when it makes sense to be nice</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.699" end="00:10:19.809" style="s2">and they&#39;re built to be Jenna Seidel in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.439" end="00:10:23.019" style="s2">circumstances when genocide is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.809" end="00:10:24.970" style="s2">then the question is well all the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.019" end="00:10:26.980" style="s2">that you actually value how consistent</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.970" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">are they with being that robot on that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.980" end="00:10:30.850" style="s2">mission so it sounds like you are sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:33.970" style="s2">of saying at our route we are nasty</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.850" end="00:10:35.730" style="s2">brutish and short the old selfish gene</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.970" end="00:10:38.199" style="s2">kind of thing compared to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.730" end="00:10:39.249" style="s2">essentialist or triumphal s clearly you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.199" end="00:10:41.529" style="s2">know it&#39;s very prevalent in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.249" end="00:10:44.649" style="s2">self-help popular psychology space we</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.529" end="00:10:46.509" style="s2">are on the frothy edge of realizing our</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.509" end="00:10:51.399" style="s2">beings blah Blee blah is that something</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.730" end="00:10:54.759" style="s2">you don&#39;t hold out hope for you feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.399" end="00:10:58.029" style="s2">like at root we are just self oriented</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.759" end="00:11:00.610" style="s2">robot programs is what&#39;s what&#39;s our shot</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.029" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">at redemption that one it&#39;s easier it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.610" end="00:11:05.589" style="s2">easier than you would think</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:08.470" style="s2">because the fact is I&#39;m telling you we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.589" end="00:11:10.209" style="s2">are that robot on that mission once you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.470" end="00:11:13.029" style="s2">know that that&#39;s your mission you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.209" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">just reject it all right I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.029" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">putting anybody in a gas</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">I just won&#39;t do it alright I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:20.600" style="s2">about the genetic Spelling&#39;s at all and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">I really don&#39;t if I discovered that my</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.600" end="00:11:25.890" style="s2">sons were switched in the hospital at</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:27.840" style="s2">birth and they were not actually related</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.890" end="00:11:30.270" style="s2">to me it doesn&#39;t change my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.840" end="00:11:31.410" style="s2">to them it doesn&#39;t affect whether I love</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.270" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">them I don&#39;t love them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.410" end="00:11:37.710" style="s2">genetic Spelling&#39;s so my point is we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:40.110" style="s2">actually evolution screwed up it handed</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.710" end="00:11:41.880" style="s2">us the tools to recognize that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.110" end="00:11:43.950" style="s2">have to value the game that it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.880" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">playing and that we can now repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.950" end="00:11:48.089" style="s2">the hardware to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">actually worthwhile and how liberating</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.089" end="00:11:53.220" style="s2">is that I mean who wants to walk around</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">with bigotry yeah I mean it&#39;s funny cuz</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.220" end="00:11:56.580" style="s2">I mean that was just in my next book</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:59.400" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a section evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.580" end="00:12:01.260" style="s2">a moral and there&#39;s and no sooner do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.400" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">realise that that you realized oh we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.260" end="00:12:04.770" style="s2">being nudged pushed and prodded into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:07.020" style="s2">whole lot of outcomes that create tons</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.770" end="00:12:10.589" style="s2">of pain in our psychosocial frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.020" end="00:12:12.630" style="s2">our value sets that are 100% wins on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.589" end="00:12:16.640" style="s2">evolutionary level yeah and tragic for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:20.430" style="s2">us right and the the crazy thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.640" end="00:12:22.710" style="s2">freedom from that is as close as just</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.430" end="00:12:25.620" style="s2">recognizing what it is and then saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.710" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">well I mean I have a particular analogy</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.620" end="00:12:32.730" style="s2">I like there&#39;s this point at which pilot</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">the pilot&#39;s name was Sully I guess</p>
