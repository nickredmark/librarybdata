<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">you&#39;re my child but also I had to learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.750" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">with where I was on my health journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:58.709" style="s2">and giving birth and that whole story</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:00.359" style="s2">which is a story in and of itself I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.709" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">to learn how to put my oxygen mask on</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.359" end="00:04:04.769" style="s2">first that even as she being my number</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:07.799" style="s2">one priority</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.769" end="00:04:10.139" style="s2">I won&#39;t be there for her whole life if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.799" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">don&#39;t take care of myself if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.139" end="00:04:15.090" style="s2">figure out if I want her to live from</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.639" style="s2">her heart and be who she truly is and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.090" end="00:04:20.519" style="s2">let herself emerge I also have to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.639" end="00:04:23.930" style="s2">that I can&#39;t be conforming and doing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.519" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">things and she showing her a bad example</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.930" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">what I felt was that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:32.009" style="s2">so we&#39;re only s 8 years into our</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.870" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">parenting journey because it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.009" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">starts when you become pregnant and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:41.879" style="s2">was pregnant almost eight years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:44.580" style="s2">and Parenthood has taught me that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.879" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">can&#39;t hold stringently to this view of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.580" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">how things are gonna be birthed taught</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.659" style="s2">me that I had a birth plan that went</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">freakin heywhy her I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.659" end="00:04:58.409" style="s2">anything I had planned followed through</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:05:00.599" style="s2">because life and my kid have their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.409" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">plan and the inter woven are interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.599" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">lives what she brings to my life her</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:09.930" style="s2">perspective the things she comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:12.150" style="s2">I could not be more in love with another</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.930" end="00:05:15.180" style="s2">human being and she taught me that she</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">taught me what love really truly is then</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:22.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not angels singing from on high you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:24.990" style="s2">never get pissed off by someone it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.440" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">opposite she can trigger me all day long</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.990" end="00:05:31.469" style="s2">she can yell I hate you in my face and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:36.870" style="s2">I&#39;m never gonna lose an ounce of love</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.469" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">for her I have enough respect for my</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.870" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2">parenting journey that I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:45.630" style="s2">other people aren&#39;t meant to be on it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:46.650" style="s2">that both our actual parenting journey</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.630" end="00:05:48.389" style="s2">like they&#39;re not meant to be in my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.650" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">because they don&#39;t like how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.389" end="00:05:54.659" style="s2">parenting her but also just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">people who choose to not be parents and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.659" end="00:05:58.949" style="s2">they&#39;re here to learn other things I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">don&#39;t think this is for everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.949" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">this this person this position of being</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">a mom to this human being is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:12.630" style="s2">what I&#39;m here to do and she is what like</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:14.159" style="s2">this world means her is herself not</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.630" end="00:06:15.990" style="s2">because she&#39;s better than anyone but</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.159" end="00:06:18.270" style="s2">because she&#39;s the best person of being</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.990" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">her she&#39;s the only one who can be her</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.270" end="00:06:27.029" style="s2">and that comes with having me as her mom</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:30.419" style="s2">with happy to family of two and did I</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.029" end="00:06:33.389" style="s2">allow her to unfold and I get to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.419" end="00:06:37.050" style="s2">along for that journey and I&#39;m on my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.389" end="00:06:38.970" style="s2">journey during that same time period so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.050" end="00:06:42.450" style="s2">this was a little bit about my parenting</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.970" end="00:06:44.310" style="s2">journey I can&#39;t ever do it justice under</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.450" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">five minutes clearly it&#39;s close to seven</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:49.320" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t do this justice talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:06:51.180" style="s2">it for years but it is continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.320" end="00:06:54.170" style="s2">unfold and I&#39;ll be continuing to share</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.180" end="00:06:54.170" style="s2">it thank you</p>
