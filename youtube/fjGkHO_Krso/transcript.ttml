<p begin="00:01:15.409" end="00:01:20.150" style="s2">then we&#39;ll just walk right through it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.799" end="00:01:23.810" style="s2">Peter and I had a great discovery</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.150" end="00:01:28.310" style="s2">continues actually about certain topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.810" end="00:01:30.500" style="s2">regarding how people are influenced and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.310" end="00:01:33.440" style="s2">how they&#39;re made suggestible is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:35.450" style="s2">even true is hypnosis a thing are these</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.440" end="00:01:37.930" style="s2">conspiracy theories true about how you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.450" end="00:01:40.690" style="s2">can make people a Manchurian Candidate</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.930" end="00:01:43.310" style="s2">of course those are the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.690" end="00:01:47.120" style="s2">troops we have when we talk about such</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.310" end="00:01:48.890" style="s2">concepts but what if it wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.120" end="00:01:51.170" style="s2">insidious what if you didn&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.890" end="00:01:53.330" style="s2">level of malicious intent to get those</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.170" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">type of results what if we were actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.330" end="00:01:59.090" style="s2">doing that all the time anyways I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:01.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know it so we kind of landed</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.090" end="00:02:06.200" style="s2">on this concept called the trauma drama</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.810" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">where the stance that I&#39;m gonna take is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.200" end="00:02:12.680" style="s2">that trauma is actually essential to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">brain this is a very complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.680" end="00:02:19.580" style="s2">very controversial thing to say because</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:21.379" style="s2">we all have varying spectrums of either</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.580" end="00:02:23.450" style="s2">trauma abuse or terrible things have</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.379" end="00:02:25.939" style="s2">happened to us this is in no way</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.450" end="00:02:26.760" style="s2">designed to undermine or make light of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.939" end="00:02:29.850" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.760" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">this is designed to explore the neural</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.850" end="00:02:36.660" style="s2">evolution of how trauma even came to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">why we even have the capacity for it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.660" end="00:02:41.520" style="s2">at the end there might be if I convey</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">this correctly I will display the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.520" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">slide without any words and we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">see what happens so much more I am ready</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.400" end="00:03:09.349" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.130" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">okay so trauma trauma start as a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.330" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">monkey and end up an alcoholic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:23.240" style="s2">just how good so move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">slide traumas start with the words right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.240" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">but I&#39;m not gonna defeat the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">trauma is is something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:35.580" style="s2">redefined that it&#39;s too personal so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">gonna start in the personal way to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.580" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">at the personal is is a homo centric</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:42.990" style="s2">concept called a definition so here we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:46.890" style="s2">start with where what it means it means</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.990" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">a wound to hurt actually its roots comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.890" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">from to rub or termed as in life like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">irritate like to grab someone like do</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">this right that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:03:58.140" style="s2">understanding if we&#39;re gonna cling to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:02.930" style="s2">the idea that trauma is this personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.140" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">experience so there&#39;s two highlights</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.930" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">because it implies that it&#39;s non-fatal</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:18.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not wound to kill its wound to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:22.370" style="s2">irritate you that some of them and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.180" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">further just might being controlled hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.370" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">so anyway because it&#39;s non-fatal and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:28.950" style="s2">it&#39;s personal it is automatically</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">implied to be homeless centric and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.950" end="00:04:34.140" style="s2">anthropogenic as a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:35.669" style="s2">so trauma is things that humans do to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.140" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">humans and that&#39;s as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.669" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">conversation tends to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:43.020" style="s2">get it from other spectrums or domains</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:46.200" style="s2">because again it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.020" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">personal and intoxicatingly so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.200" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">very hard to you know remove yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">from that kind of experience it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">compelling when it comes to that so boy</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.350" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">that yellow line yellow anybody did that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">can you please undo that Debbie yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">do people do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:08.040" style="s2">there I think they&#39;re kindly</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:09.750" style="s2">highlighting something okay I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.040" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">know what they could do that please stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.750" end="00:05:16.530" style="s2">doing that I don&#39;t know if you can it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">just gonna be this yellow circle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.530" end="00:05:24.390" style="s2">into recording the whole time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:27.060" style="s2">nothing weird anybody&#39;s a pro a pro and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.390" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">zoom that would be super but I&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.060" end="00:05:30.420" style="s2">going until someone figures it out all</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">right so what I decided to do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.420" end="00:05:35.760" style="s2">continue with the anthropogenic in-home</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.200" style="s2">eccentric definition of trauma and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.760" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">start with a history of psychology which</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.200" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">is where trauma therapy even thank you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">for moving that with it with a history</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:45.240" style="s2">of this research even comes from and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">lot of these gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.240" end="00:05:53.370" style="s2">academic but I&#39;m gonna focus on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:55.940" style="s2">important about these things trauma</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.370" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">research comes from trying to defeat the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.940" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">the Victorian British Menace of hysteria</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:05.970" style="s2">in women that&#39;s where it actually starts</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:07.950" style="s2">so the British Victorians were very keen</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.970" end="00:06:09.990" style="s2">of their industrial accomplishments and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.950" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">their imperial conquest of the lessers</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.990" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">and their hopes that they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">modernize them if these damn women just</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:17.430" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t stop crying all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:20.190" style="s2">that&#39;s as far as they looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.430" end="00:06:20.910" style="s2">that was pretty premature to even come</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.910" end="00:06:24.480" style="s2">but they did it anyway of course they</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.850" style="s2">were wildly wrong in their prescription</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.480" end="00:06:28.890" style="s2">but this is where the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.850" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">studying trauma originates from at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.890" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">in the West and the modern West I should</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:37.470" style="s2">say punctuate that so it starts from</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:39.420" style="s2">trying to make very upset women less</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.470" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">upset not by dealing with their actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.420" end="00:06:43.790" style="s2">issues of course but more like poking</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:49.220" style="s2">and prodding them like subjects and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.790" end="00:06:49.220" style="s2">inefficiencies that unfortunately led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.360" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">which then leads us to it led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.260" end="00:07:05.410" style="s2">premature categorisation of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:07.210" style="s2">so the stereo was too wide of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.410" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">umbrella it didn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.210" end="00:07:12.310" style="s2">enough it was just stupid so you had two</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:14.710" style="s2">different people is your name fraud</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.310" end="00:07:16.510" style="s2">sorry did I say fraud I didn&#39;t say fraud</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.710" end="00:07:21.400" style="s2">that was a bit fruity and slick no pun</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.510" end="00:07:23.830" style="s2">intended but the there was two different</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.400" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">schools of thought he had disassociation</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.830" end="00:07:26.620" style="s2">and he had double consciousness again</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:28.600" style="s2">he&#39;s implied two totally different</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.620" end="00:07:30.550" style="s2">things they imply that there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.600" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">spirit within you right so this</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.569" end="00:15:20.110" style="s2">a kind of a tough spot because trauma as</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.509" end="00:15:44.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s uncomfortable and hard to</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.180" end="00:16:08.829" style="s2">and culture is playing a role in how</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.939" end="00:16:30.759" style="s2">the cost will be because fuck so when</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.120" end="00:16:34.149" style="s2">you&#39;re approached with this question how</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.759" end="00:16:36.279" style="s2">do we find a baseline how do we find a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.149" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">baseline where is this mythical person</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.279" end="00:16:41.319" style="s2">that is independent of culture how can</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:43.420" style="s2">we identify this one being in which we</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.319" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">can then nullify or at least identify to</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">trauma and the answer is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.380" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">fucking miserable use children</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">they had culture now children to acquire</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.830" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">culture fairly rapidly but not at all in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:04.610" style="s2">ages there&#39;s a gap between like zero and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:06.770" style="s2">two and three and this goes into a dark</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.610" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">place pretty fucking quick so I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.770" end="00:17:11.209" style="s2">into this dark space and I promise I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">immediately bounce out of it so you had</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.209" end="00:17:16.550" style="s2">child sexual abuse that&#39;s a thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:18.770" style="s2">also considered a post-traumatic stress</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.190" end="00:17:42.679" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing the same behavior here</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.880" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">maybe children also get it too because</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.679" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">that children has control group pre</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:52.130" style="s2">culture can act as that sort of way to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:57.950" style="s2">do the differential analysis between</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.130" end="00:18:02.330" style="s2">other cultures so then you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.950" end="00:18:03.860" style="s2">more detailed of detailed results what</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.330" end="00:18:06.950" style="s2">children go through poor impulse control</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.950" end="00:18:14.300" style="s2">relationships you guys can read so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.390" end="00:18:17.300" style="s2">research is done it has been done for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.300" end="00:18:19.850" style="s2">the past probably 70 years at this point</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.300" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">I would consider it a fairly dark</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.850" end="00:18:24.890" style="s2">chapter in this type of research there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">still plenty of children who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.890" end="00:18:30.200" style="s2">subjected to not only controlled</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:33.110" style="s2">examples of these experiments but also</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.200" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">uncontrolled if you look at the way mass</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.110" end="00:18:38.270" style="s2">media works which we will get there</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:40.540" style="s2">eventually during this talk but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.270" end="00:18:44.179" style="s2">displaying children can&#39;t do display</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.179" end="00:18:49.429" style="s2">abuse now this implies that independent</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.540" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">of culture there is something about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.429" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">human brain that is that has either ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:19:03.470" style="s2">to deal with stress or is reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:04.770" style="s2">stress or or something unexplained right</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.470" end="00:19:06.570" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:08.550" style="s2">let&#39;s get out of this dark place like</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.570" end="00:19:12.120" style="s2">prison I don&#39;t like being here so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.550" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">go find other baselines instead let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.120" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">take some presumptions before we get</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:16.650" style="s2">there what if it isn&#39;t anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:18.360" style="s2">what have we been wrong about this whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.650" end="00:19:21.000" style="s2">time all of our research has been about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.360" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">looking at how trauma affects people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.000" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">how people applied trauma to people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.480" style="s2">it&#39;s all people-oriented but what if</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:29.490" style="s2">what if nature fucks us up what if like</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.480" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t know lightning bolt it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.490" end="00:19:33.030" style="s2">uncle it&#39;s pretty traumatic right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.990" end="00:19:36.179" style="s2">didn&#39;t come from a person came from</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.030" end="00:19:37.740" style="s2">floor or something so what if it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.179" end="00:19:39.870" style="s2">home eccentric what if humans aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.740" end="00:19:41.179" style="s2">only things going through trauma I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.870" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a valid question</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.179" end="00:19:48.270" style="s2">but if non-human mammals also go through</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">trauma like dogs or elephants that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.270" end="00:19:52.050" style="s2">fair assumption I think enough of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">have pets or worked in farms to seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.050" end="00:19:55.710" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">so let&#39;s either children alone for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.710" end="00:19:58.770" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">scientists thanks let&#39;s go look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.770" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">animals right maybe it&#39;s their turn to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.850" end="00:20:08.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of examples I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.739" end="00:20:11.809" style="s2">in and out of this one too because this</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.879" end="00:20:15.479" style="s2">gets dark as well African elephants</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.809" end="00:20:20.149" style="s2">demonstrate PTSD when they see their</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.479" end="00:20:22.859" style="s2">herd get cult or killed in bulk they</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.149" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">have differences in how they interact</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.859" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">with the herds they then integrate with</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:33.929" style="s2">their ability to follow age-related cues</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:37.109" style="s2">gets completely shattered they</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.929" end="00:20:38.489" style="s2">demonstrate depression as far as one can</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.109" end="00:20:40.019" style="s2">do like putting their head against the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.489" end="00:20:41.249" style="s2">wall for example repeatedly banging</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.019" end="00:20:44.609" style="s2">their head against the wall they will do</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.249" end="00:20:46.739" style="s2">that so it turns out that social mammals</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.609" end="00:20:48.889" style="s2">not just humans are also displaying</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.739" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">signs of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.889" end="00:20:55.739" style="s2">again the question keeps coming back is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">this fundamentally neurological is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.739" end="00:21:00.450" style="s2">part of the the animal brain is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:01.830" style="s2">like this person&#39;s brain is at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.450" end="00:21:04.019" style="s2">cultures brain or is there something</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.830" end="00:21:08.970" style="s2">fundamental to how the brain has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.019" end="00:21:10.940" style="s2">organized in which trauma exists and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.970" end="00:21:13.109" style="s2">then there is another example which</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.940" end="00:21:15.599" style="s2">there was another example regarding</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.220" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">and I decided not to put it in here but</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.830" end="00:21:24.869" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a baseline it was it was a</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.149" end="00:21:41.970" style="s2">from like it wasn&#39;t like smacking</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:48.149" style="s2">disease for 10 years straight and even</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.989" end="00:21:49.979" style="s2">then trauma happened so even if your</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.259" end="00:22:09.599" style="s2">but you can look it up ok so social</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:11.519" style="s2">mammals are going through this - trauma</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.599" end="00:22:13.499" style="s2">is happening here all right so we got</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.499" end="00:22:18.450" style="s2">different cultures mammals ok that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.900" end="00:22:23.799" style="s2">well but if it&#39;s not only for mammals</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.299" end="00:22:25.299" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to answer where trauma</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.799" end="00:22:28.570" style="s2">comes from so now we have to look</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.299" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">outside of mammals but if it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.570" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">about animals who don&#39;t have complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">socialization elephants have it and dogs</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:40.360" style="s2">have it cats have it we have it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:43.659" style="s2">what about things like I don&#39;t know ants</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.360" end="00:22:45.429" style="s2">where it&#39;s just like genetic caste</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.659" end="00:22:49.809" style="s2">system and the communication is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.429" end="00:22:52.779" style="s2">pheromones what if this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.809" end="00:22:54.549" style="s2">trauma being local and trauma being</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.779" end="00:22:56.710" style="s2">personal what if it turns out that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.549" end="00:23:01.450" style="s2">actually universal and a byproduct of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.710" end="00:23:05.140" style="s2">biology that would be uncomfortable but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.450" end="00:23:09.130" style="s2">it would open up the answer these</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.140" end="00:23:10.539" style="s2">questions so let&#39;s start using non metal</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.130" end="00:23:13.870" style="s2">social animals and opens of our neural</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.539" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">trajectory at all so things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.870" end="00:23:19.899" style="s2">have human capacity or social mammals or</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:22.299" style="s2">things that are freaking alien like fish</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.899" end="00:23:24.279" style="s2">right so even Petco says hey you fish</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.299" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">get traumatized get stressed out and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.279" end="00:23:27.909" style="s2">they demonstrate it right I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.740" style="s2">fish could get drama that demon Donna me</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.909" end="00:23:31.330" style="s2">like I knew all the other stuff it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.740" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">fish right but apparently fish get upset</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.330" end="00:23:35.799" style="s2">they prescribed that the way to fix a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.950" style="s2">fish when they&#39;re upset is to fix their</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.799" end="00:23:42.039" style="s2">environment surprisingly because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.039" end="00:23:45.909" style="s2">their ph balance to be wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.960" end="00:23:48.820" style="s2">nutrients could be wrong or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.909" end="00:23:52.539" style="s2">anything could happen there so that code</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.820" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">has a pragmatic it&#39;s they didn&#39;t intend</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.539" end="00:23:56.529" style="s2">for this to be part of this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:24:01.210" style="s2">I&#39;m sure but it&#39;s a pragmatic approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.529" end="00:24:02.980" style="s2">to it&#39;s in it&#39;s an innocently pragmatic</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.980" end="00:24:07.899" style="s2">something and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.429" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">here if you decide to read into it the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.899" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">idea of fixing the environment to fix</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">the fish as opposed to fixing the fish</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:16.690" style="s2">which is what the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:19.210" style="s2">responsibilities of trauma dictates that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.690" end="00:24:22.870" style="s2">we should do so I found that to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.210" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">rather interesting yes you&#39;d think ants</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.870" end="00:24:26.830" style="s2">felt goofy trauma and you&#39;d be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:30.970" style="s2">so the way that there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.830" end="00:24:33.160" style="s2">group of ants Africa amount of delay I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.970" end="00:24:36.039" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;m pronouncing that right</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.160" end="00:24:39.220" style="s2">they have to go to war everyday with</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.039" end="00:24:42.250" style="s2">termites around their colonies to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.220" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">food so they&#39;re there in invasive</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.250" end="00:24:46.360" style="s2">carnivores from the jump that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:49.090" style="s2">way the Geo destiny has set them out to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.360" end="00:24:51.309" style="s2">be and when they are wounded because of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.090" end="00:24:53.320" style="s2">these constant fighting they lose levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.309" end="00:24:54.910" style="s2">many limbed creatures and they lose them</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.320" end="00:24:56.890" style="s2">and when they lose the limb they spit</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.910" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">out some chemical substance and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.890" end="00:24:59.860" style="s2">all buddies say oh my god it&#39;s George</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.350" style="s2">he&#39;s wounded let&#39;s go pick him up and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.860" end="00:25:04.150" style="s2">carry him back but it doesn&#39;t end there</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.350" end="00:25:08.130" style="s2">there&#39;s some additional stuff about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.150" end="00:25:10.270" style="s2">trauma response that&#39;s also interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.130" end="00:25:13.960" style="s2">once it&#39;s there they then proceeded to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.270" end="00:25:16.780" style="s2">do Medical prep on the ant now you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.960" end="00:25:19.929" style="s2">think these ants are breeding at a rate</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.780" end="00:25:22.750" style="s2">that stupendous like 10,000 20,000 a why</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.929" end="00:25:24.940" style="s2">even bother salvaging a single ant but</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.750" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">an Sapir to make the calculation that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.940" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a good idea we shouldn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.700" end="00:25:31.690" style="s2">told you shouldn&#39;t put the burden</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:33.640" style="s2">exclusively on the Queen&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.690" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">create more ants we should salvage what</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.640" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:38.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s when we possible because of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:41.049" style="s2">trauma signaling so now we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.770" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">to see okay perhaps there&#39;s a function</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.049" end="00:25:47.559" style="s2">to trauma as opposed to it being this</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:51.640" style="s2">individual experience the Licking will</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.559" end="00:25:53.740" style="s2">be done too and that this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.640" end="00:25:57.850" style="s2">particular study was done in Switzerland</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.740" end="00:26:01.539" style="s2">and Varion region of Germany so they the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.850" end="00:26:03.390" style="s2">Swiss have a ant colony that has one</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.539" end="00:26:06.490" style="s2">feature that is unlike any other feature</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.390" end="00:26:08.850" style="s2">it&#39;s an ant colony where multiple gene</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.490" end="00:26:10.809" style="s2">lines of ants live simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.850" end="00:26:13.419" style="s2">usually they go to war and kill each</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.809" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">other but this one in the Alps they work</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.419" end="00:26:19.390" style="s2">all together and they have the two times</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:21.429" style="s2">like big big big big knives and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.390" end="00:26:23.530" style="s2">millions and millions of queens there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.429" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">millions of queens in that hive let</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.530" end="00:26:27.309" style="s2">alone the tens and hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">of ants and because of so much life</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.309" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">krahgg through it that these ant piles</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">generated stupendous amount of heat and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">that in turn becomes a incubator for</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:42.090" style="s2">bacteria and viruses so what these hands</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:44.770" style="s2">have done is a they farm they form a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.090" end="00:26:46.690" style="s2">resin from local trees and then they</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.770" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">spit the formic acid on the resin</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.690" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">and then they take the combination and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.700" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">then they clean each other with it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:54.840" style="s2">it has antimicrobial properties so</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">they&#39;re actually administering anti</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.840" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">biotics to each other which is between</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.910" end="00:27:02.770" style="s2">us and the ants that&#39;s the only animals</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:05.260" style="s2">that actually do that to chemically</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.770" end="00:27:08.140" style="s2">synthesize an anti biotic which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.260" end="00:27:09.880" style="s2">fascinating but that&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.140" end="00:27:12.210" style="s2">here they&#39;re they&#39;re cleaning each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.880" end="00:27:15.160" style="s2">to make sure that there&#39;s no infection</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.210" end="00:27:16.840" style="s2">and this is disis ants whose brains are</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.160" end="00:27:18.910" style="s2">so small I can&#39;t even recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.840" end="00:27:20.710" style="s2">right so biology and neurology is a hell</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.910" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">of a thing and trauma appears to be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.710" end="00:27:25.180" style="s2">important way to signal that whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:26.680" style="s2">process but what about what if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.180" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">severely maimed what if you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.680" end="00:27:32.440" style="s2">really mangled here whatever the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:33.640" style="s2">is just unbelievably severe because the</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.380" end="00:27:47.590" style="s2">a pain and it&#39;s flailing around and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.150" end="00:27:49.060" style="s2">is sending the signal but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.590" end="00:27:50.140" style="s2">it&#39;s flailing around so much that its</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.060" end="00:27:52.330" style="s2">buddies can&#39;t help it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.140" end="00:27:54.430" style="s2">you can&#39;t put a flailing an on your back</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.330" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna fall off all the time and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.430" end="00:27:58.390" style="s2">you have to make the call and say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.260" end="00:28:00.280" style="s2">this ant isn&#39;t flowing as much I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.390" end="00:28:03.640" style="s2">actually save this one and this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.280" end="00:28:05.140" style="s2">just do now that&#39;s interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.640" end="00:28:07.180" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like they&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.140" end="00:28:08.950" style="s2">moral decision it&#39;s not like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.180" end="00:28:10.510" style="s2">saying well I&#39;m gonna save as many as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.950" end="00:28:13.630" style="s2">can it&#39;s not utilitarianism it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.510" end="00:28:16.110" style="s2">locally there the grading of the caliber</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.630" end="00:28:18.850" style="s2">that&#39;s being expressed from the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.110" end="00:28:21.670" style="s2">the Pope battlefield is just immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.850" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">it after the conflict so it has to make</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.670" end="00:28:26.590" style="s2">these gradient based decisions and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:29.410" style="s2">it has to assess really quickly can I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.590" end="00:28:30.940" style="s2">even pick that thing up and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.410" end="00:28:34.770" style="s2">making again it&#39;s not a utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.940" end="00:28:34.770" style="s2">moral choice at least I think so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:40.150" style="s2">interestingly enough one could extract</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.570" end="00:28:44.260" style="s2">that this exchange could be the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.150" end="00:28:47.290" style="s2">stoicism to a degree the idea that oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.260" end="00:28:48.850" style="s2">well I&#39;m wounded or I&#39;m hurt or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.290" end="00:28:50.800" style="s2">being traumatized by this thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.850" end="00:28:52.300" style="s2">can&#39;t control and if I flail around</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.800" end="00:28:55.990" style="s2">about it I&#39;m not going to get the help I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.300" end="00:28:59.140" style="s2">want but if I&#39;m kind of nonchalant about</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.990" end="00:29:01.380" style="s2">it let it happen and sit and process it</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.140" end="00:29:03.940" style="s2">that might be a way to attract the help</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.380" end="00:29:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.940" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">true or not but it is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.380" end="00:29:11.770" style="s2">aside because ants already doing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.060" end="00:29:13.540" style="s2">apparently but yeah they they flail</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.770" end="00:29:17.410" style="s2">around it&#39;s basically a death sentence</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.540" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">so okay we got animals we have mammals</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.410" end="00:29:20.770" style="s2">we got critters that aren&#39;t mammals get</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:23.050" style="s2">in somewhere we&#39;re finally making some</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.770" end="00:29:25.510" style="s2">damn sense here trauma is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.050" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">demonstrate functional purpose as</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.510" end="00:29:29.260" style="s2">opposed to being this miserable thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:32.260" style="s2">that happens to us and we&#39;re just doomed</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.260" end="00:29:36.280" style="s2">to live with it forever there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.260" end="00:29:37.900" style="s2">some neurological purpose here but if</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.280" end="00:29:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s natural it&#39;s been it&#39;s continued to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.900" end="00:29:41.170" style="s2">make some assumptions here</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.040" end="00:29:43.630" style="s2">what if trauma is natural it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.170" end="00:29:47.050" style="s2">you&#39;re alive there&#39;s trauma that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.630" end="00:29:48.670" style="s2">game what if it&#39;s functional and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.050" end="00:29:52.030" style="s2">starting to demonstrate than it is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.670" end="00:29:53.650" style="s2">mean what if it&#39;s required that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.030" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">painful one that&#39;s a real tough one</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.650" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">the idea that trauma is required so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">let&#39;s look into how that could be</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:06.310" style="s2">and we&#39;ll use evolutionary psychology so</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:07.300" style="s2">where does this even come from if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.310" end="00:30:11.650" style="s2">going to if we&#39;re going to make these</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.300" end="00:30:17.250" style="s2">presumptions where is the driver for</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.650" end="00:30:17.250" style="s2">this cognitive state coming from</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.519" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">predator and prey eating that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.840" end="00:30:27.460" style="s2">it&#39;s coming from you can confirm this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.340" style="s2">over and over again with studies like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:32.739" style="s2">this where you can take predator urine</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.340" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">spray it around mice and they&#39;ll lose</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.739" end="00:30:39.009" style="s2">their shit they&#39;ll demonstrate PTSD just</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:42.369" style="s2">by smelling the piss that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.009" end="00:30:45.759" style="s2">that shows that it&#39;s it&#39;s fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.369" end="00:30:47.499" style="s2">the neurology because this is their not</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.759" end="00:30:50.049" style="s2">fundamental to neurology as much as its</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.499" end="00:30:51.940" style="s2">it is this relationship between predator</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.049" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">and prey where trauma is originating</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:57.989" style="s2">from and that&#39;s a that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:02.590" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.989" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">because that implies that certain types</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.590" end="00:31:09.129" style="s2">of trauma can be categorized a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:10.929" style="s2">correctly as opposed to women nasteria</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.129" end="00:31:13.269" style="s2">and men who have shell shock and child</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.929" end="00:31:15.820" style="s2">sex survivors what if you get down to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.269" end="00:31:17.739" style="s2">that fundamental about how much of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.820" end="00:31:20.109" style="s2">predator prey psychology aren&#39;t we still</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.739" end="00:31:22.210" style="s2">carrying with us and we might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.109" end="00:31:30.279" style="s2">identify how our stress response and our</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.210" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">trauma responses are formulating yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.279" end="00:31:35.259" style="s2">right so likely effects on fecundity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.590" end="00:31:37.989" style="s2">survival are the norm in nature and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.259" end="00:31:40.119" style="s2">the idea that it is beneficial for prey</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.989" end="00:31:41.739" style="s2">to go through trauma because it enhances</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.119" end="00:31:44.739" style="s2">their ability to survive against future</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.739" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">predator attacks so now we&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.739" end="00:31:50.919" style="s2">the actual function behind it this</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:53.109" style="s2">something can only exist if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.919" end="00:31:55.149" style="s2">benefit a two-degree you can have some</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.109" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">maladaptive stuff as well but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.149" end="00:31:59.649" style="s2">maladaptive is still functional at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:02.109" style="s2">same time so how can that be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.649" end="00:32:03.759" style="s2">right that&#39;s a wild statement I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.109" end="00:32:05.080" style="s2">delving deep in the controversy here if</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.759" end="00:32:08.919" style="s2">we&#39;re still clinging to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.080" end="00:32:10.509" style="s2">traumas it&#39;s to personal experience so</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.919" end="00:32:12.220" style="s2">just hang tight I promise it&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.509" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">sense so this is the the predator odor</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.220" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">just just knowing the owner being aware</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:22.059" style="s2">of it and kind of putting the prey in</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:23.980" style="s2">that type of state and this is again</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.059" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">mapped at the brain level to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.980" end="00:32:29.309" style="s2">MRIs on all these animals that&#39;s showing</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:29.309" style="s2">the brain is actually doing these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.900" end="00:32:34.220" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ve been I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.390" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">make a premature categorization here</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.220" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">feel free to trash it tell me I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">all day long I&#39;m not gonna strongly</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:43.820" style="s2">defend this categorization it&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:46.820" style="s2">drive a concept oh and maybe you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:48.470" style="s2">some stuff and maybe you won&#39;t so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.820" end="00:32:51.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about and from what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.470" end="00:32:52.850" style="s2">suspect most of the trauma that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.140" end="00:32:55.420" style="s2">describing that we go through</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.850" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">individually is actually prey drama</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.420" end="00:33:01.210" style="s2">meaning we&#39;re describing trauma from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:03.170" style="s2">perspective of being predated upon</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.210" end="00:33:05.240" style="s2">that&#39;s only one half of the picture</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.170" end="00:33:07.270" style="s2">because predators go through trauma two</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.240" end="00:33:12.230" style="s2">it&#39;s just they go through it differently</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.270" end="00:33:13.850" style="s2">so let&#39;s look at it Freight trauma these</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.230" end="00:33:17.000" style="s2">are the four things that we associate</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.850" end="00:33:19.429" style="s2">with PTSD according to some variant of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.000" end="00:33:24.170" style="s2">DSM that I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.429" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s hyper arousal meaning when</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.170" end="00:33:27.740" style="s2">you go through the trauma now all your</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.300" style="s2">senses are fired up I&#39;m now really</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.740" end="00:33:33.550" style="s2">looking around right I&#39;m smelling things</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.300" end="00:33:33.550" style="s2">I&#39;m tasting things I&#39;m like alive more</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.040" end="00:33:41.720" style="s2">hyper aroused and what does that do why</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.190" end="00:33:43.610" style="s2">why would that be a response to trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.720" end="00:33:46.400" style="s2">well it enhances your alertness you just</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.610" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">got chased by a predator so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.400" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">be aware that if there are more</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:51.500" style="s2">predators behind me have I really outrun</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:53.300" style="s2">this thing you know you want to be you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.500" end="00:33:54.770" style="s2">want to take in and drink those details</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.300" end="00:33:57.410" style="s2">as much as you can so you can make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.770" end="00:33:58.970" style="s2">assessment that maybe okay maybe I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.410" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">start toning it down a bit maybe I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.970" end="00:34:03.860" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s safe to chill for a second so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:05.540" style="s2">hyper arousal makes a ton of sense from</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.860" end="00:34:08.570" style="s2">the functional trauma standpoint in</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.540" end="00:34:10.270" style="s2">terms of the evolution of it unwanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.570" end="00:34:13.220" style="s2">recurrent memories of the stress so</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.270" end="00:34:15.050" style="s2">flashbacks right back in Nam and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.220" end="00:34:16.850" style="s2">type of stuff but there&#39;s a there might</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.050" end="00:34:18.379" style="s2">be a function to that too because if</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.850" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">you&#39;re forced to replay the experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.379" end="00:34:23.090" style="s2">over and over again then you will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:24.860" style="s2">forced to then extract additional</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.090" end="00:34:26.120" style="s2">patterns and more associations from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.860" end="00:34:28.100" style="s2">shit you might have missed when you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.120" end="00:34:29.510" style="s2">too busy running so you&#39;re running you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.100" end="00:34:31.310" style="s2">know god this was behind me I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.510" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">really taking in all the things around</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.310" end="00:34:34.370" style="s2">me I&#39;m just jogging that tree I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:37.370" style="s2">jumping over that water I&#39;m doing all</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.370" end="00:34:40.850" style="s2">these things but maybe I missed</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.370" end="00:34:43.070" style="s2">something maybe I was running and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.850" end="00:34:45.170" style="s2">some ice and I was slipping around</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.070" end="00:34:47.450" style="s2">and I now the lesson is when I&#39;m running</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.170" end="00:34:50.030" style="s2">from a predator avoid ice because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.450" end="00:34:52.580" style="s2">bad because it&#39;s gonna fuck me up so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.030" end="00:34:54.710" style="s2">only way to get that retrained into your</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.580" end="00:34:57.710" style="s2">brain is to have it forced into your</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.710" end="00:34:59.480" style="s2">experience over and over again so now</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:02.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a function to what is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.480" end="00:35:04.190" style="s2">flashback so let&#39;s keep going</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.600" end="00:35:06.890" style="s2">avoiding of associated appointments of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.190" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">associative where now you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.890" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">chance to practice what it is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:13.070" style="s2">formulating your mind or not you got</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:15.340" style="s2">formulating in your mind you are</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:27.240" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.410" end="00:35:28.530" style="s2">things you&#39;ve associated so going back</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.240" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">to the ice example you&#39;re running your</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.530" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">supplies now what you&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">avoid ice from here on out okay oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:36.090" style="s2">that&#39;s predators and ice are a bad mix I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:37.830" style="s2">should avoid that so now you&#39;re avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.090" end="00:35:41.910" style="s2">the things you&#39;re associating and so but</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.830" end="00:35:46.080" style="s2">your your body is naturally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:47.790" style="s2">naturally concluding or I should say by</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.080" end="00:35:49.290" style="s2">associating to predators</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.790" end="00:35:53.310" style="s2">you are either enhancing your</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.310" end="00:35:56.760" style="s2">you&#39;re just batshit crazy you made a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.750" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">wrong association that happens too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.760" end="00:36:00.750" style="s2">not like those an authority a referee</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">out here saying oh you&#39;re associative</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.750" end="00:36:04.500" style="s2">czar correct you&#39;re just going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">best you can with the limited you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.500" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">meet space you have but you will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:13.500" style="s2">avoiding those associative as part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:15.330" style="s2">confirming that you have learned trauma</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.500" end="00:36:17.160" style="s2">based learning and then social</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.330" end="00:36:19.890" style="s2">detachment this one&#39;s a little tough I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.160" end="00:36:24.270" style="s2">gonna wing this one probably Bronk but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.890" end="00:36:26.790" style="s2">think because in case anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.270" end="00:36:30.030" style="s2">social by nature I realized the flaw of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.790" end="00:36:34.470" style="s2">using social mammals here I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.030" end="00:36:36.030" style="s2">because they are social and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.470" end="00:36:39.240" style="s2">lot of social stimuli going on all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.030" end="00:36:40.920" style="s2">time that detaching from the social so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.240" end="00:36:42.690" style="s2">that you can spend more time with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.920" end="00:36:45.390" style="s2">trauma and so you can extract all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:48.300" style="s2">associative from it I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.390" end="00:36:49.740" style="s2">important part of making sure and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.300" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">enhancing your survival for the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.740" end="00:36:54.300" style="s2">encounter so you minimize your inputs as</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:56.339" style="s2">much as you can and say okay let me</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.300" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">really process this and get what I want</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.339" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">so from the prey standpoint trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:04.200" style="s2">actually really important for survival</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:06.150" style="s2">if all of this holds have the details</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.200" end="00:37:09.810" style="s2">and details and again I&#39;m spitballing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.150" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">here as much as I can but I&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.810" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">that there is neurological functional</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:17.430" style="s2">purpose behind the things we do and from</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:20.910" style="s2">the perspective of tray prey it appears</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.430" end="00:37:25.880" style="s2">that trauma helps them slough so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.910" end="00:37:29.250" style="s2">catch my breath because that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.880" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">predator trauma predators are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.250" end="00:37:33.210" style="s2">same thing they have the same trauma</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:36.059" style="s2">responses here</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.210" end="00:37:39.900" style="s2">but there&#39;s a key difference for prey</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.059" end="00:37:41.910" style="s2">the trauma is personal they do have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.900" end="00:37:44.849" style="s2">learn these new tricks</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.910" end="00:37:47.579" style="s2">to get better skillsets against future</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.849" end="00:37:50.940" style="s2">predation so it&#39;s very individual but</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.579" end="00:37:52.859" style="s2">predators their trauma is intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.940" end="00:37:55.759" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.859" end="00:37:55.759" style="s2">now why is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.270" end="00:38:00.910" style="s2">so you&#39;ll see cases of monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.010" end="00:38:05.410" style="s2">baboons and apes and although all that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.170" end="00:38:09.490" style="s2">family dogs</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.410" end="00:38:12.260" style="s2">killer whales they&#39;re all having a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.490" end="00:38:13.460" style="s2">different context for the same trauma so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.260" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">they&#39;re actually felting for different</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.460" end="00:38:21.410" style="s2">lessons so for example there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:22.270" style="s2">pack there&#39;s a type of penguin I forget</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.410" end="00:38:24.920" style="s2">which one it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.270" end="00:38:26.359" style="s2">and monkeys do this too there&#39;s a type</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.920" end="00:38:29.180" style="s2">of penguin I&#39;m gonna focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.359" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">steals from other penguins so the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.180" end="00:38:32.660" style="s2">Penguins will get together and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.460" style="s2">make a nest I&#39;ll take all the rocks and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.660" end="00:38:36.770" style="s2">I&#39;ll make their nests out of the rocks</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.460" end="00:38:38.510" style="s2">now you can either go look for a rock</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.770" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">and then add it to your nester you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.510" end="00:38:41.900" style="s2">steal the rock from other penguins but</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:43.640" style="s2">when you steal rock from having penguins</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.900" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">you want to make sure that the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.640" end="00:38:46.730" style="s2">penguins aren&#39;t around to see you do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:48.740" style="s2">so there&#39;s deception and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.730" end="00:38:50.570" style="s2">deflection going on right so I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.740" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">to hide the fact that I&#39;m stealing from</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.570" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">this thing so I don&#39;t violate any social</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">resource sharing type of things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">stuck in so that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">trauma that&#39;s that is effectively a form</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:02.990" style="s2">of trauma any psychologist will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re engaging these type of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.990" end="00:39:07.819" style="s2">behaviors that&#39;s traumatic response and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.480" end="00:39:09.069" style="s2">animals giving us there are animals that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.819" end="00:39:11.270" style="s2">steal from each other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.069" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">they&#39;ll steal from other species too not</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.270" end="00:39:14.420" style="s2">just from the tribe it only get caught</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">in the predator prey trap so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.420" end="00:39:18.530" style="s2">minimizing their exposure to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:21.079" style="s2">clouding the analysis of the social</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.530" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">situation to you know maintain where</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.079" end="00:39:25.640" style="s2">they&#39;ve been plotting also happens this</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:29.180" style="s2">happens all the time in males oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.640" end="00:39:30.589" style="s2">alpha is there and the betas don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.180" end="00:39:31.880" style="s2">it they plot they form a pack and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.589" end="00:39:32.270" style="s2">kill the often monkeys do this all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.880" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.270" end="00:39:36.500" style="s2">humans do this all the time but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:40.609" style="s2">social trauma and that is predator</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.500" end="00:39:44.349" style="s2">trauma it&#39;s needing so again</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.609" end="00:39:46.520" style="s2">chimps I&#39;m overlying on chimps here but</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.349" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">sometimes people get excited sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.520" end="00:39:50.630" style="s2">animals of the packet exiled they failed</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.430" style="s2">an attempt to take out the alpha for</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.630" end="00:39:54.050" style="s2">example so they get booted out they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.430" end="00:39:55.880" style="s2">come back bleeding don&#39;t try for years</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.050" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">in some cases to come back pleading</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.880" end="00:40:00.560" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s predator trauma prey prey</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:03.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really do that very much they</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:04.760" style="s2">don&#39;t try to get back in the pack mostly</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.260" end="00:40:06.109" style="s2">especially the case for rabbit their</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.760" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">life cycle look so faster</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.109" end="00:40:09.980" style="s2">you&#39;re either dead or not but predators</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">are robust in terms of social</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.980" end="00:40:15.740" style="s2">arrangements they have to work as a unit</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">and all of these trauma points are ways</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.740" end="00:40:19.640" style="s2">to signal that something is wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:23.000" style="s2">the unit something&#39;s wrong with the</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.000" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">now functional we&#39;re still in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.440" end="00:40:28.630" style="s2">of functional improvement</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:31.269" style="s2">except that in this case it&#39;s gone to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.630" end="00:40:33.959" style="s2">the social cohesion as opposed to an</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.269" end="00:40:37.209" style="s2">individual betterment from the prey side</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.959" end="00:40:38.440" style="s2">naked aggression is very common snapping</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.209" end="00:40:39.459" style="s2">at people but what you&#39;re doing in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.440" end="00:40:41.289" style="s2">naked aggression is you&#39;re demonstrating</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.459" end="00:40:44.380" style="s2">your PAC utility saying I am still</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.289" end="00:40:46.539" style="s2">fierce I am still useful in the hunt and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.380" end="00:40:48.309" style="s2">subservience it&#39;s very common trauma</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.539" end="00:40:50.049" style="s2">we&#39;re like oh this person&#39;s beating me</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.309" end="00:40:51.910" style="s2">fucking stop please I will I will</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.049" end="00:40:54.609" style="s2">you know I&#39;ll respect the alpha and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.910" end="00:40:59.859" style="s2">self-criticism then that all predator is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.609" end="00:41:01.479" style="s2">the same there are there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.859" end="00:41:03.369" style="s2">the run and chase predator and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.479" end="00:41:04.749" style="s2">there&#39;s the ambush predator big spiders</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.369" end="00:41:06.279" style="s2">or some type of spiders so they dig</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.749" end="00:41:09.880" style="s2">themselves in a hole in the know jump</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.279" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">out right they need to associate</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.880" end="00:41:13.539" style="s2">themselves in their environment to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:16.359" style="s2">if their camouflage works so if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.539" end="00:41:18.699" style="s2">fail on a hunt that they fail to scoop</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.359" end="00:41:20.589" style="s2">someone consistent one they&#39;re starving</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.699" end="00:41:22.150" style="s2">they don&#39;t have food if expended a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.589" end="00:41:24.999" style="s2">of energy to go get that food and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.150" end="00:41:27.609" style="s2">work so now they have to do like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.999" end="00:41:29.949" style="s2">proto self-criticism have I have I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.609" end="00:41:31.900" style="s2">probably blended into my environment now</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.949" end="00:41:34.269" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing this cognitively I</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.900" end="00:41:36.190" style="s2">like the way I&#39;m describing it but there</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.269" end="00:41:39.130" style="s2">is the the trace foundation of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.190" end="00:41:42.130" style="s2">self-criticism element is there so this</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.130" end="00:41:44.589" style="s2">is there are there&#39;s overlap here or two</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.130" end="00:41:46.180" style="s2">is not so cleanly separated there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.589" end="00:41:47.739" style="s2">things there are trauma responses that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.180" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">both predator and prey do like for</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.739" end="00:41:52.089" style="s2">excessive grooming for example both of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:54.269" style="s2">these critters will do that whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.089" end="00:41:57.309" style="s2">a cat or whether it&#39;s a guinea pig</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.269" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">excessive grooming is a common response</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.309" end="00:42:02.229" style="s2">when social trauma is available but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:07.050" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do is I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.229" end="00:42:08.700" style="s2">that there is at least</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.050" end="00:42:11.070" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to accept that there that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:12.570" style="s2">trauma has a functional source and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.070" end="00:42:14.850" style="s2">going to accept that the primary driver</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.570" end="00:42:17.340" style="s2">is the predator-prey relationship then</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.850" end="00:42:19.350" style="s2">it&#39;s probably worth exploring how there</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.340" end="00:42:22.380" style="s2">might be differences to them to then</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.350" end="00:42:24.830" style="s2">make some proper diagnosis here so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.380" end="00:42:27.810" style="s2">gonna go through a couple of examples</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.830" end="00:42:30.290" style="s2">well first we&#39;ll just walk through and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.810" end="00:42:32.970" style="s2">summarize all the stuff I&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.290" end="00:42:34.380" style="s2">it drives unlearning unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.970" end="00:42:36.060" style="s2">learning so it&#39;s not like a lesson it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.380" end="00:42:38.310" style="s2">not like reciting with a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.060" end="00:42:40.430" style="s2">saying oh yeah then you know on 1773</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.310" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">some guy did a thing it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.430" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">traumas there it happens so fast in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:48.180" style="s2">predator-prey scenario that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">have time to actually sit and absorb all</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.180" end="00:42:53.370" style="s2">of it you have to get the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.480" end="00:42:56.790" style="s2">the problem so you&#39;re running really</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.370" end="00:43:00.090" style="s2">quick your prayed and so the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.790" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2">drive lessons from that experience is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.090" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2">unconsciously the repetition of memories</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.640" end="00:43:11.490" style="s2">avoiding associative to then practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.990" end="00:43:12.900" style="s2">the things you&#39;re extracting social</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.490" end="00:43:15.240" style="s2">detachment to enhance your extraction</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.900" end="00:43:17.100" style="s2">abilities hyper arousal to to even see</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.240" end="00:43:18.570" style="s2">if that if the predator is is still</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.100" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">there for the next count so this is all</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.570" end="00:43:22.770" style="s2">unconscious things that your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:23.930" style="s2">will do on your behalf without your</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.770" end="00:43:27.330" style="s2">permission</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.930" end="00:43:29.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s embedding it&#39;s not memorized</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.330" end="00:43:31.530" style="s2">it&#39;s embedding into your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.070" end="00:43:34.890" style="s2">response that&#39;s an important part too</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.530" end="00:43:36.810" style="s2">and then when it&#39;s embedded it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.890" end="00:43:40.230" style="s2">recalled like oh I remember what I did</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.810" end="00:43:42.180" style="s2">Tuesday it&#39;s replayed so if you go back</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.230" end="00:43:43.560" style="s2">a couple slides you&#39;ll see that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.180" end="00:43:46.860" style="s2">the trauma people they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.560" end="00:43:49.650" style="s2">memorize the trauma but they replay it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.860" end="00:43:52.490" style="s2">all the same they go through what has</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.650" end="00:43:56.460" style="s2">happened to them and that makes sense if</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.490" end="00:43:58.140" style="s2">this is functionally true they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.460" end="00:43:59.970" style="s2">through it to extract additional</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.140" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">patterns so that they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.970" end="00:44:06.510" style="s2">traumatized again right so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:08.520" style="s2">recall it like you&#39;re reciting from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.510" end="00:44:10.320" style="s2">test through replaying it because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.520" end="00:44:12.060" style="s2">still not comfortable with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.320" end="00:44:15.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken all the lessons you need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.060" end="00:44:17.670" style="s2">take from it and pray does this then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.900" end="00:44:20.309" style="s2">replay memory adjust behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.670" end="00:44:22.020" style="s2">what avoidance social avoidance does and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.309" end="00:44:24.650" style="s2">the avoidance of associative so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.020" end="00:44:27.809" style="s2">adjusting how you&#39;re interacting onward</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.650" end="00:44:29.970" style="s2">and that in turn is a that behavior</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.809" end="00:44:32.280" style="s2">affects your fitness do you read do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.970" end="00:44:33.930" style="s2">not breathe do you get do you help your</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.280" end="00:44:35.670" style="s2">tribe you not help a tribe all of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.930" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">triples through it and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.670" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">Fitness is the driver of the trauma to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:42.089" style="s2">begin with the trauma relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:44.250" style="s2">between predator and prey around the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.089" end="00:44:47.010" style="s2">circle becomes a circling strife right</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.250" end="00:44:48.869" style="s2">so here we are this is this fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.010" end="00:44:50.700" style="s2">complete circle where the trauma is then</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.869" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">selecting for how to avoid the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.700" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">but then it&#39;s an arms race which is why</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:58.890" style="s2">it&#39;s so difficult to dislodge so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:01.260" style="s2">give some examples of all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.890" end="00:45:03.059" style="s2">against pit bowling please tell me where</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.260" end="00:45:05.849" style="s2">I&#39;m wrong in this one I&#39;ll be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.059" end="00:45:09.329" style="s2">do the research know this just give some</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.849" end="00:45:13.380" style="s2">examples right so this critter shows up</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.329" end="00:45:15.780" style="s2">it&#39;s hungry it&#39;s mad wants a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.380" end="00:45:17.970" style="s2">that rabbit go but from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.780" end="00:45:22.049" style="s2">predator-prey relationship the responses</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.970" end="00:45:24.270" style="s2">will be different the rabbit this is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.049" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">irrational monster it&#39;s ruining its day</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.270" end="00:45:27.809" style="s2">it has tend to take care of them this</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:29.640" style="s2">damn thing wants to eat all of them this</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.809" end="00:45:32.849" style="s2">is not what I signed up for I&#39;m running</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.640" end="00:45:35.099" style="s2">right the wolf on the other hand looks</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.849" end="00:45:36.299" style="s2">at that and says as trash competition</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.099" end="00:45:39.299" style="s2">I&#39;ll beat your ass you&#39;re nothing to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.299" end="00:45:41.730" style="s2">so the the trauma response is different</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.299" end="00:45:43.740" style="s2">between the two players a rabbit would</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.730" end="00:45:45.569" style="s2">never come to a conclusion that I could</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.740" end="00:45:46.829" style="s2">beat you I think it&#39;s going to eat his</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.569" end="00:45:49.580" style="s2">family it has a history of eating its</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.829" end="00:45:51.050" style="s2">family so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.580" end="00:45:54.020" style="s2">and it drills we fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.050" end="00:45:59.120" style="s2">between the two players see another</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.020" end="00:46:01.790" style="s2">example grass how does prey look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.120" end="00:46:03.740" style="s2">grass versus a predator like West prey</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.790" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">obviously sees food that&#39;s association</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.740" end="00:46:08.570" style="s2">in this case and the preys the food food</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:12.410" style="s2">so they both sort of seafood ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.570" end="00:46:14.510" style="s2">indirect so one is very like to grass</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.410" end="00:46:17.030" style="s2">put in mouth make Association the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.510" end="00:46:19.400" style="s2">one is oh my food eats here so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.030" end="00:46:20.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a layer of indirection that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.400" end="00:46:22.190" style="s2">predator then has to make the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.390" end="00:46:24.140" style="s2">association of and it can do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.190" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">through predator trauma because if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.140" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">starves then it made the incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">Association of where the food food came</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:31.619" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:32.610" style="s2">so then what if you start doing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.619" end="00:46:34.410" style="s2">human thing where you start</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.170" end="00:54:58.790" style="s2">I talk about the ideals you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:58.790" style="s2">about from the perspective of the ideals</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.730" end="00:55:06.750" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s not covered very well</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.290" end="00:55:10.109" style="s2">in the predator-prey relationship is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.750" end="00:55:13.080" style="s2">idea of self-sacrifice that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.109" end="00:55:14.970" style="s2">abundantly well studied in case of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.080" end="00:55:17.280" style="s2">ants and termites they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.970" end="00:55:19.560" style="s2">self-destructive crazy chemicals and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:21.240" style="s2">just ruin any invader and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.560" end="00:55:22.980" style="s2">got too close and then boom that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.240" end="00:55:24.210" style="s2">covered in acid that&#39;s gonna ruin your</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.980" end="00:55:31.010" style="s2">life right so that&#39;s kind of a self</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.210" end="00:55:35.430" style="s2">sacrifice but the idea of self sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.010" end="00:55:37.260" style="s2">is is it&#39;s almost like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.430" end="00:55:40.890" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a well-defined stoic ideal</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.260" end="00:55:43.589" style="s2">or it&#39;s a virtue but I do know that when</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.890" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">you demonstrate it it can induce</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.589" end="00:55:47.609" style="s2">traumatic response and all the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:49.530" style="s2">watching but sometimes that traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.609" end="00:55:51.630" style="s2">response can be good and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.530" end="00:55:53.849" style="s2">could be whatever you&#39;re angling for I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.630" end="00:55:56.460" style="s2">can&#39;t give you a clear answer on this</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.849" end="00:55:59.070" style="s2">one unfortunately and it does sound like</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.460" end="00:56:02.690" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to contrive this into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.070" end="00:56:13.230" style="s2">pitch that I just made I recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.690" end="00:56:14.940" style="s2">but I to get to ideals ideals are so far</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.230" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">down the line from the intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.940" end="00:56:19.589" style="s2">predator-prey formation of cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:21.030" style="s2">I have to like walk through each and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.589" end="00:56:27.000" style="s2">every one of them before I can get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.030" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">them so that my deal space do you think</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.000" end="00:56:29.770" style="s2">it&#39;s possible like you said the servant</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:31.990" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.770" end="00:56:33.550" style="s2">of the predator-prey dynamic do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.990" end="00:56:36.460" style="s2">think it&#39;s possible to be subservient to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.550" end="00:56:39.190" style="s2">a higher ideal like the truth yes or</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.460" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">Jesus or whatever yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.190" end="00:56:47.740" style="s2">absolutely because it&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:49.900" style="s2">perception theory but because because of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.740" end="00:56:51.880" style="s2">the way that whether it&#39;s whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.900" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">learning in the formal sense or that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.880" end="00:56:57.640" style="s2">unconscious learning in which trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:59.500" style="s2">heavily leveraging in either case you</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.640" end="00:57:02.590" style="s2">have to make judgments from incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.500" end="00:57:04.180" style="s2">positions and you have to be right how</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.590" end="00:57:07.030" style="s2">do I know the perimeters not chasing me</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.180" end="00:57:08.740" style="s2">I just can&#39;t like you know hey Google is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.030" end="00:57:10.810" style="s2">the predator still on my ass I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.740" end="00:57:13.390" style="s2">that right so I have to make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.810" end="00:57:16.660" style="s2">about my own life which only got one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.390" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m erratic running I only got one I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.660" end="00:57:21.369" style="s2">got an even decision that that thing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:27.190" style="s2">not chasing anymore so I can help coupie</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.369" end="00:57:30.520" style="s2">and stuff like that so neurology appears</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.190" end="00:57:33.869" style="s2">to be selecting for means to make valid</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.520" end="00:57:36.730" style="s2">decisions from incomplete spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.869" end="00:57:39.609" style="s2">sometimes the artifact of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.730" end="00:57:42.850" style="s2">incompletion can be represented very</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.609" end="00:57:45.220" style="s2">cleanly in a belief or an ideal and once</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.850" end="00:57:47.350" style="s2">it fits there then all of the traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.220" end="00:57:50.170" style="s2">responses will interact with that I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.350" end="00:57:52.869" style="s2">deal and believe as if it was as valid</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.170" end="00:57:54.730" style="s2">as a reality concert so I think yes you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.869" end="00:57:56.590" style="s2">could you can have a predator-prey</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.730" end="00:57:58.869" style="s2">relationship Trump you have a prey</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.590" end="00:58:01.420" style="s2">trauma and predator relationship from a</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.869" end="00:58:04.330" style="s2">predator trauma relationship with ideals</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.420" end="00:58:09.600" style="s2">that happen to correspond with making</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.330" end="00:58:11.830" style="s2">decisions from incomplete spaces so um</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.600" end="00:58:15.430" style="s2">we&#39;re at the hour Margaret II or at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.830" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">hour you cool a stable of 15-20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.430" end="00:58:18.850" style="s2">filled with useful questions you know if</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:21.640" style="s2">anyone has to leave you feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.850" end="00:58:25.240" style="s2">leave but there&#39;s a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.640" end="00:58:26.859" style="s2">questions here so let&#39;s do Daniel if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.240" end="00:58:32.890" style="s2">can kind of meet yourself and ask your</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.859" end="00:58:35.290" style="s2">questions to Pat yeah I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.890" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">option okay yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.290" end="00:58:38.950" style="s2">now you have the option to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">yourself Daniel okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.950" end="00:58:43.900" style="s2">thanks Pat yeah I had a thought when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:46.570" style="s2">when you map things out in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.900" end="00:58:48.550" style="s2">predator-prey a dynamic in my mind it</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.570" end="00:58:52.030" style="s2">could potentially a map to also a master</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.550" end="00:58:53.860" style="s2">slave or sadist masochist dynamic and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.030" end="00:58:55.480" style="s2">my mind went to this question maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.860" end="00:58:58.150" style="s2">can riff on it what does your definition</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.480" end="00:59:02.220" style="s2">of trauma say about sexual desire and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.150" end="00:59:02.220" style="s2">power dynamics and adult relationships</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.630" end="00:59:13.990" style="s2">yes there is a lot of overlap there</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.150" end="00:59:15.790" style="s2">because of the predator prey model to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.990" end="00:59:20.350" style="s2">answer this question I have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.790" end="00:59:23.820" style="s2">presupposition that the trauma we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.350" end="00:59:26.860" style="s2">experience that we are experiencing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.820" end="00:59:30.550" style="s2">indicative of the structural limitations</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.860" end="00:59:32.950" style="s2">of Neurology itself and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.550" end="00:59:39.250" style="s2">that is that the reason we have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.950" end="00:59:41.380" style="s2">trauma we have is because the way in</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.250" end="00:59:44.650" style="s2">which the brain has to operate as an</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.380" end="00:59:48.100" style="s2">efficient machine in terms of fuel and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.650" end="00:59:50.560" style="s2">resource input self consistent</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.100" end="00:59:52.360" style="s2">management and then output into behavior</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.560" end="00:59:55.450" style="s2">that then guarantees the brain can keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.360" end="00:59:59.110" style="s2">going that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.450" end="01:00:00.340" style="s2">dance and so in that dance that very</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.110" end="01:00:02.320" style="s2">complicated dance you&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.340" end="01:00:04.600" style="s2">up with a wide variety of different</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.320" end="01:00:05.740" style="s2">behavioral outcomes and processes that</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.600" end="01:00:08.110" style="s2">can then drive those many of your</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.740" end="01:00:09.190" style="s2">outcomes in the event of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.110" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">predator-prey stuff that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.190" end="01:00:17.140" style="s2">about that&#39;s just one subset mating</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:19.990" style="s2">habits is totally driven by very similar</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.140" end="01:00:24.150" style="s2">types of limitations and social habits</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.990" end="01:00:26.560" style="s2">as well all of these drivers</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.150" end="01:00:28.530" style="s2">intrinsically have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.560" end="01:00:31.120" style="s2">physical space it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.530" end="01:00:33.400" style="s2">abstractions to most animals the</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:55.150" style="s2">predator-prey relationships I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:55.750" style="s2">they&#39;re borrowing from each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.150" end="01:01:58.090" style="s2">toolkits</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.750" end="01:02:03.220" style="s2">a lot there&#39;s going to be a lot of reuse</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.090" end="01:02:06.270" style="s2">overlap as like a quick follow-up I</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.220" end="01:02:08.860" style="s2">think the the piece I&#39;m curious about is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.270" end="01:02:11.100" style="s2">it&#39;s also found in Stockholm Syndrome</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.860" end="01:02:13.810" style="s2">like in in a dynamic where it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.100" end="01:02:15.640" style="s2">an organism is going back to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.810" end="01:02:17.590" style="s2">traumatic event or they&#39;ve repurposed it</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.640" end="01:02:20.680" style="s2">as sexual desire or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.590" end="01:02:22.150" style="s2">which isn&#39;t necessarily the like not</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.680" end="01:02:24.340" style="s2">everyone agrees with that premise but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.150" end="01:02:26.230" style="s2">just thought it throw it in there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.340" end="01:02:28.540" style="s2">it&#39;s feasible that during the replaying</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.230" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">of the trauma that the social and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.540" end="01:02:35.830" style="s2">sexual contexts are also being trained</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:38.500" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s not just purely</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.830" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">the predator and prey the brain is very</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.500" end="01:02:43.780" style="s2">limited space to to freely experiment</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:47.050" style="s2">even with neuroplasticity it&#39;s not as if</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.780" end="01:02:49.930" style="s2">the brain is turning you into a chair it</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.050" end="01:02:52.210" style="s2">has it has to deal with very specific</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.930" end="01:02:53.800" style="s2">inputs and outputs and your glucose and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.210" end="01:02:56.320" style="s2">your oxygen consumption is very tightly</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.800" end="01:02:57.880" style="s2">monitored here so it has to play with</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.320" end="01:02:59.530" style="s2">those within the bounds of that resource</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.880" end="01:03:02.710" style="s2">so it makes sense to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.530" end="01:03:05.320" style="s2">some sharing but like I said there is no</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.710" end="01:03:07.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no referee on what associates</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.320" end="01:03:09.570" style="s2">are valid and which ones parked that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.480" end="01:03:12.670" style="s2">up for natural selection to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.570" end="01:03:14.350" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a comfortable thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.670" end="01:03:15.340" style="s2">for humans because we have this idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.350" end="01:03:20.320" style="s2">that we can always make things better</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.340" end="01:03:21.880" style="s2">but life is like it&#39;s hard sometimes and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.320" end="01:03:24.550" style="s2">not everyone wins I mean we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.880" end="01:03:26.800" style="s2">die so we don&#39;t win right so that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.550" end="01:03:28.510" style="s2">but but I think you&#39;re gonna see because</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.800" end="01:03:29.590" style="s2">of a resource constraints and the fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.510" end="01:03:32.290" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t a referee of what</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.590" end="01:03:35.340" style="s2">associate is a valid you&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.290" end="01:03:35.340" style="s2">sharing these techniques</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.480" end="01:03:44.660" style="s2">okay Irene would you like to unmute</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.160" end="01:03:44.660" style="s2">yourself and ask about your question I</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.830" end="01:03:52.560" style="s2">can I&#39;ll meet you there you go</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.410" end="01:03:55.320" style="s2">hi hi everyone thank you so yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.560" end="01:03:57.660" style="s2">that PSD symptoms and a lot of reactions</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.320" end="01:03:59.670" style="s2">are a mechanism of self-protection to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.660" end="01:04:01.410" style="s2">survive in that hostile or terrible</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.670" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">environment but what about little</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.410" end="01:04:06.210" style="s2">children that are pre verbal that have</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:10.460" style="s2">attachment trauma where the parent is</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.210" end="01:04:10.460" style="s2">there&#39;s not sexual trauma but the parent</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:15.150" style="s2">abuse the parent is there then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.349" end="01:04:17.060" style="s2">absent they may have depression</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.150" end="01:04:20.790" style="s2">themselves what about intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.060" end="01:04:22.950" style="s2">trauma so these are inherited responses</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.790" end="01:04:24.839" style="s2">to traumas that you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.950" end="01:04:26.400" style="s2">consciously process which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.839" end="01:04:28.820" style="s2">happening with First Nations right now</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.400" end="01:04:31.349" style="s2">how does that fit into your model so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.820" end="01:04:34.980" style="s2">because the predator trauma is</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.349" end="01:04:37.109" style="s2">intrinsically social predators tend to</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.980" end="01:04:39.839" style="s2">have this I&#39;m saying tend I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.109" end="01:04:42.510" style="s2">all they tend to have this feature where</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.839" end="01:04:44.580" style="s2">they have to very carefully Medicare</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.510" end="01:04:45.930" style="s2">their youth they can&#39;t just dump ten</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.580" end="01:04:47.820" style="s2">thousand babies I&#39;m just kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.930" end="01:04:50.099" style="s2">yeah well y&#39;all figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.820" end="01:04:52.520" style="s2">the wolf has to very carefully take care</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.099" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">of its child we have to take care</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.520" end="01:04:56.910" style="s2">probably not in case of what they lose</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:58.349" style="s2">but but we have to take care of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.910" end="01:04:59.609" style="s2">children elephants have to take care of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.349" end="01:04:59.940" style="s2">children monkeys of to take care of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.609" end="01:05:03.300" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.940" end="01:05:06.330" style="s2">so the the predator trauma responds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.300" end="01:05:08.099" style="s2">either failing to get prey or failing to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.330" end="01:05:10.260" style="s2">negotiate the resource distribution of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.099" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">the tribe intrinsically leads to these</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.260" end="01:05:17.310" style="s2">family formations for efficiency trauma</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:19.380" style="s2">trauma response methodology in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.310" end="01:05:23.550" style="s2">ecosystem tended towards so it does make</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.380" end="01:05:25.190" style="s2">sense that if there is a familial bond</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.550" end="01:05:28.890" style="s2">that is shattered in advance</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.190" end="01:05:31.380" style="s2">disassociation excuse me and it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.890" end="01:05:32.460" style="s2">allowed to persist that&#39;s where things</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.380" end="01:05:35.839" style="s2">get too sticky that&#39;s where things get</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.460" end="01:05:38.550" style="s2">real tough because in where you have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:40.530" style="s2">lot of these tribal creatures if there</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.550" end="01:05:42.869" style="s2">is a social bond that is a strumpet or a</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.530" end="01:05:45.570" style="s2">social trauma a predator trauma has been</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.869" end="01:05:47.720" style="s2">activated they will make it their prime</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.570" end="01:05:49.579" style="s2">priority to solve that shit right</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.720" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">it won&#39;t sit there some of them might</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.579" end="01:05:54.560" style="s2">sit there and linger debate isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:56.540" style="s2">exile they do that lingering revenge</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.560" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">fantasy type of thing wolves do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.540" end="01:05:59.569" style="s2">against the awful a lot but it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:03.130" style="s2">buried forever</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.569" end="01:06:05.660" style="s2">it does express itself so social traumas</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.130" end="01:06:07.190" style="s2">lead to intergenerational trauma but</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.660" end="01:06:09.619" style="s2">intergenerational trauma is only</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.190" end="01:06:11.660" style="s2">feasible if the social trauma is allowed</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.619" end="01:06:13.940" style="s2">to happen it&#39;s allowed to persist and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.660" end="01:06:15.619" style="s2">you can&#39;t resolve it which naturally</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.940" end="01:06:17.210" style="s2">predators do they will resolve these</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.619" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">traumas and they won&#39;t let them sick and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.210" end="01:06:21.619" style="s2">let them invest and linger so I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:22.819" style="s2">say that the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.619" end="01:06:24.410" style="s2">intergenerational trauma is only</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.819" end="01:06:26.770" style="s2">possible when you have so much resource</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.410" end="01:06:28.730" style="s2">abundance that you don&#39;t care if</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.770" end="01:06:33.230" style="s2">someone&#39;s traumatized because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.730" end="01:06:41.810" style="s2">more opportunity tomorrow do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.230" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">follow-up question to that because I</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.810" end="01:06:46.940" style="s2">think there&#39;s different forms of trauma</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:48.829" style="s2">so if it&#39;s like a freeze response you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:08:09.170" end="01:08:14.870" style="s2">that&#39;s so yes yes I would agree that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.500" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">idea of efficiencies in terms of speed</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.870" end="01:08:19.910" style="s2">efficiency that&#39;s that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:20.780" style="s2">promoting at all so let&#39;s maybe do one</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.910" end="01:08:22.430" style="s2">last question</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.780" end="01:08:30.260" style="s2">devinder you had a question about</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.430" end="01:08:34.450" style="s2">depression where are you Devinder when</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.260" end="01:08:34.450" style="s2">on mute you there you go</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.270" end="01:08:46.609" style="s2">devinder you&#39;re muted so you know so how</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.819" end="01:08:49.460" style="s2">does a depressive disorder fitting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.609" end="01:08:51.020" style="s2">the repeated trauma mother - so what</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.460" end="01:08:53.630" style="s2">about depression that goes away you</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.020" end="01:08:56.410" style="s2">learned for me bounce back but as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.630" end="01:08:59.470" style="s2">depression that never goes away say you</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.410" end="01:09:03.020" style="s2">commit suicide or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.470" end="01:09:06.980" style="s2">yeah so again the because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.020" end="01:09:08.839" style="s2">referee of associative as a result it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.980" end="01:09:10.609" style="s2">not as if you&#39;ve made enough associative</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.839" end="01:09:12.260" style="s2">and you can walk away I&#39;ve made 20</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.609" end="01:09:13.760" style="s2">associations about all the lessons I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.260" end="01:09:15.470" style="s2">learned from my trauma now I can walk it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.760" end="01:09:17.780" style="s2">off whoo I did it give me my medal um</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.470" end="01:09:19.700" style="s2">there&#39;s no authority out there and say</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.780" end="01:09:20.839" style="s2">that you found enough lessons and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.700" end="01:09:24.500" style="s2">you&#39;re comfortable enough to actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.839" end="01:09:27.200" style="s2">step back and engage that&#39;s gonna be up</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.500" end="01:09:29.299" style="s2">to a combination of social factors in</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.200" end="01:09:33.410" style="s2">biochemistry that is just a wild ass</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.299" end="01:09:39.260" style="s2">dance you can engage in type of</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.410" end="01:09:42.020" style="s2">therapeutical responses to mitigate that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.260" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">to a degree whether that works not is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.020" end="01:09:45.969" style="s2">again that&#39;s it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:48.069" style="s2">probabilistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.969" end="01:09:51.150" style="s2">hedge-fund approach as opposed to me you</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.069" end="01:09:56.079" style="s2">know take this pill and you&#39;ll be fine</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.150" end="01:09:58.510" style="s2">but the if my guess is that if we look</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.079" end="01:10:00.190" style="s2">at the predator-prey thing as some type</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.510" end="01:10:03.070" style="s2">of guidance again not the de facto</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.190" end="01:10:05.409" style="s2">standard just as a method of guidance if</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.070" end="01:10:07.650" style="s2">I am constantly trying to extract</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.409" end="01:10:10.960" style="s2">additional associations from the trauma</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.650" end="01:10:14.380" style="s2">then I know where I feel or I believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.960" end="01:10:15.969" style="s2">that I&#39;m not I am I have not learned all</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.380" end="01:10:18.579" style="s2">of the things that have happened from</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.969" end="01:10:21.099" style="s2">this and I am NOT in the space where I</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.579" end="01:10:24.510" style="s2">can even continue until I go until I</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.099" end="01:10:30.179" style="s2">keep going that sounds like a viable</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.510" end="01:10:33.219" style="s2">outcome given how the brain is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.179" end="01:10:36.969" style="s2">organize itself it may be compulsively</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.219" end="01:10:38.349" style="s2">trying to extract associative and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.969" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">would be where I would look at for in</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.349" end="01:10:42.070" style="s2">terms of like you know neurological</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:47.289" style="s2">disorder if I had to put a drug</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.070" end="01:10:51.639" style="s2">reference to something cool okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.289" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">gonna stop there so before I make any</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.639" end="01:10:55.530" style="s2">closing and that&#39;s what&#39;s bad do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.719" end="01:10:59.710" style="s2">have any final thoughts to share on this</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.530" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">yeah like I said this is this is my</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.710" end="01:11:07.300" style="s2">ongoing campaign to strike at all things</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:08.860" style="s2">Western science because I think it just</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.300" end="01:11:11.349" style="s2">needs to be done they&#39;ve had a good run</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.860" end="01:11:12.820" style="s2">I&#39;m still there about a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.349" end="01:11:14.829" style="s2">things that they&#39;ve decided and pushed</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.820" end="01:11:17.110" style="s2">out of the rug so this is just and get</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.829" end="01:11:20.050" style="s2">another expression of me thinking a</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.110" end="01:11:22.239" style="s2">crack shat crack shot at that type of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.050" end="01:11:24.099" style="s2">direction so my bias is out there in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.239" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">open and obvious as a result of being</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.099" end="01:11:27.239" style="s2">biased obviously I&#39;m gonna make some</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:29.079" style="s2">mistakes I&#39;m going to make some wild</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.239" end="01:11:30.999" style="s2">associations that shouldn&#39;t be made to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.079" end="01:11:35.349" style="s2">take that accordingly but I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.999" end="01:11:39.420" style="s2">free for exception driven stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.349" end="01:11:41.070" style="s2">always free for any type of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.420" end="01:11:44.969" style="s2">question or concern or criticism about</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.070" end="01:11:47.160" style="s2">this hopefully this again I&#39;m my goal</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.969" end="01:11:49.710" style="s2">here is to say let&#39;s kind of back off</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.160" end="01:11:51.719" style="s2">from trauma as the personal and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.710" end="01:11:55.920" style="s2">look at it in context as a functional</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.719" end="01:11:57.239" style="s2">response from either why the individual</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.920" end="01:11:59.550" style="s2">goes through it and then what that means</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.239" end="01:12:01.880" style="s2">for social response to it I think if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.550" end="01:12:04.530" style="s2">look at that systemically you start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.880" end="01:12:06.840" style="s2">reorganize approaches to trauma</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.530" end="01:12:12.780" style="s2">perhaps ideally in a more effective</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.840" end="01:12:13.260" style="s2">manner very cool so we&#39;re gonna stop</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.780" end="01:12:14.730" style="s2">there</p>
