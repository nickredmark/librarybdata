<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">the theme is um about mental models</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.159" style="s2">uh so peter suggested uh he has a slew</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">of these mental models that he uses to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.159" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">navigate</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">the complexity of life from selfhood</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">um so throughout the series the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">to chat about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">um as a group and so we can have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">kind of coherency throughout the month</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">invited</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">i guess to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">the first time around but i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">looking forward to this and i actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">this has been a really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">um opportunity for me to just write down</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">like a lot of the stuff that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">in my head so i think that was also</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a good forcing function as we call</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">it in physics so um</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">and so function is a good mental model</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">as well versus function is also a mental</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">model that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">yeah so how would you like uh today to</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">kind of this stuff and i thought that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">it would be useful to just go through</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">in september is going to be somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">you all um so why this topic right</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">i do believe that the easy mode of sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">making is over</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">um and uh what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">um the world is getting more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">um or</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">rather the stakes are getting higher for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:28.880" style="s2">people who have bad sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">and um all of the easy you can reach for</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">it and grab it and like yeah i believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">that narrative right that kind of makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">um those things all are starting to feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">cheesy</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">for most of us right it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">feel like wow that&#39;s like basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s not proper to say karen as</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">a as a pejorative but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">from a medic standpoint someone on 4chan</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">might say oh that&#39;s basic care and sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">making right</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">um and so we all feel that like oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of cheesy sense making what</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">do i even believe that um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">mega crowd would say well that&#39;s fake</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">news because everything&#39;s fake news</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s true everything is fake news</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">most of reality that we live in is inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">subjective so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">but but in any case the point is that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">we are we are now in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">a much frothier uh water</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">and and so that easy mode is over um i</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">also realized that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">my personal perspectives come from uh a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.759" style="s2">weird combination of things and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">when i have conversations uh like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.759" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">ones that we&#39;ll be having here on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">stowa but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">um just in my personal life and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">person with friends and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">um i&#39;ll sometimes sometimes say things</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">and people say wow peter that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s a you know haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">thought about that way and to me it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">seems very natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">and so i&#39;m interested in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">you know how is it that i came to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">of these perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">um and uh and so getting it all down on</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">is is helpful and lastly sharing is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">caring</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:47.880" style="s2">um ultimately you know if you uh look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.880" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">the things that people involved in kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">of the game b</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">world and the infinite game world um</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">kind of the spirit that we carry is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">if we share with each other we learn</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">from each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">um we all get smarter right there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">generativity to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">so how did i get here well</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">um in 2016 uh those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">connected to or aware of american</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">politics might</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">remember that some stuff went down in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">2016. and actually it was throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">course of that year</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">that i began thinking more about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">philosophy of technology and actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">how technology connects to society</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">i was starting to feel out of sorts with</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">some of the technology trends happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">in my little corner of the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">around open source and data science</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">machine learning um as well as</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">understanding how the business world</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">um understanding how the capital markets</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">work and and getting deeper on that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">as i developed as an entrepreneur and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">these things intersected</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">and i kind of went i would say my</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">journey really started kind of in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">first half of 2016</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">and i discovered that if i started</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">asking questions and pulling on threads</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a great depth uh great uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">hello i think someone just accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">turned off mute uh oh okay sorry no</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">worries yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">so what i what i realized is that on any</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">thread that i pulled there was a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">intellectual depth behind there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">there&#39;s some very deep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">and moreover if you were to kind of poke</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">into all these different little areas</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">there were some deeper threads that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">connected those together and i was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">interested in that that kind of nerd</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">sniped the physicist to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">so i started mapping out like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">what are these different things you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">i had</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">um a whole thing i written up about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">web we lost</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">um also right off the election i started</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">apply the udo loop to making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">what was going on i gave a talk at an</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">unconference in january of 20</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">some older some younger that that all</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">intersect and so i just put it out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">as kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">brain tump of um a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">kind of like one layer of the bestiary</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">these are topics concepts i could</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">probably do a half hour long talk on any</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">at least even for some of these a half</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">hour be just skimming the surface</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">um and moreover they all intersect and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a gordian knot of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">all intersecting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">some of these things may be quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">familiar to some of you some of them may</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">be very unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">but i assure you that this is a how many</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">one two three four five</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:02.839" style="s2">or 40 to 50 flay or flavored layer cake</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">and every flavor adds something</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.839" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">different it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">really interesting how each of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">things tied to the others</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">um and so these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">these are what i would call sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">nodes or or</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">deeper concepts or theories or a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">body of work on it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">um some things are like a philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">entire body of work like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">jacques lowell talks about totalizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">technology um and he has a very large</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">body of work there&#39;s people who just</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">their entire academic career studying</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">what he says</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s other things which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">blog post right or a rich</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">series of blog posts um for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">gervais theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">by um by uh venkat rao</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">but they all come together they all</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s when you put all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">lenses together and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">through 50 different at 50 different</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">frequencies you see a richer set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">things than if you look at just two or</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">and beyond that there&#39;s additional</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">topics that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re not giant nodes under</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">themselves but they are either</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">directly tied to some concrete dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">uh other thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">or they are a particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">trajectory through this like you know 50</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">100 dimensional space of topics</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">um that i guess i could also talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">so um that i would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">sets up kind of the here you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">uh here&#39;s the bestiary of ideas i had</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">prepared a couple of slides in advance</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">to talk through um oh can i not go back</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">oh my mouse is back okay hold on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">there it is um uh i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">starting the upper left here</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">on the metaphysics of quality and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">that touches</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">um the the sense of self and the super</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">what i call the superpositional identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">that also can tag on to things like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">keegan models of development as well as</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">you know metzinger&#39;s theory of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">consciousness the perceptual self model</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">um these kinds of things and i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">that is a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">starting point to talk about to anchor a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">lot of these other discussions</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">um but we can just ignore that all</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">together and talk about these other</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">things just in their own right and their</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">interactions with each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s the i&#39;ll just put it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">what do you guys think peter like you</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">um i guess i&#39;ll throw back at you what</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">would be most interesting for you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">explore and and what way to explore it</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">and how to leverage sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">collective intelligence here at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">stole</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">um well i i would like to is it cheesy</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">to sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">of say like maybe put it to a vote or</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">just like see what the chat says and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">what people are interested if people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">some some folks may be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">hearing about any of it and there&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">for the ride</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">others may say oh that what does that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">we could try um do this as a buffet i do</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">five minutes on every little thing or we</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">can go really deep on a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">right is um so the question is uh like</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">do we talk about like one model like</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">deep dive into it and then go to another</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">um is there like a theme of uh um</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">like that you have like a taxonomy okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">this is this set of models</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">uh because i recall interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">gabrielle</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">uh weinberg who the ceo and founder of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">duckduckgo he has this book super</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">and he has you know he collects all</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">these mental models there and he has</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">something called supermodels like models</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">that can apply cross domain and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">ones that are more kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">contextually uh tethered</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">um so i&#39;m wondering if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">taxonomy of these mental models</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">um and maybe that can kind of orientate</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">us to decide what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">what to look at um</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a taxonomy unfortunately um</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">if i spend a little more time i might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">i was saying coloring or turning these</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">into boxes of like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">metaphysics part</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">here is the identity consciousness sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">thing here are uh sociological things</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">here are technology and sociological</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">things here&#39;s technology by itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">and like there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of a way i</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">could there&#39;s one way to take it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">to use robert percy&#39;s um concept to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">the analytical knife</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">and slice this thing but i wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s the only way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">um i think the one that um maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">most for me the the most important one</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">to start with would be actually the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">metaphysics of qual metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">uh and and i&#39;m sorry if everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">already read that and it&#39;s like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">old hat but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">i feel like no one really talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">very much and i don&#39;t know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">because everyone already knows it or if</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">no one knows it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">because you know conversations focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">the new what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">yeah um i think that&#39;d be good to double</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">click on that one</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">quite a few people were saying which</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">models you use most frequently and which</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">ones you found</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">uh most valuable so maybe that could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">another um</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">thread to pull on and then uh from</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">now till next week in the discord we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">kind of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">like i can send this powerpoint to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">people we can figure out which ones they</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">would like and vote on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">uh well someone wanted to see the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">slide right so here&#39;s the other slide</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">and at this level of um structure or</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">object or whatever</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">um but i&#39;ll start with the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">of quality because i feel like that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">a lot of our issues are metaphysical in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">nature um if people</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">are interested uh there&#39;s that the uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">that freedom 2.0 blog post um on my</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">is one i would um recommend people kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">of go through and read because i do talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">about the fact that we are coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">we are we have a philosophical crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">the crisis and sense making is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">because of a philosophical crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">we don&#39;t even know how to define what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">and is not an object so we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">talk about relationships and theories of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">objects because</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">our metaphysics is falling apart because</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">we have created new</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">kinds of pseudo-reality and this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">where it gets kind of into bodrillard</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">and the society of the spectacle and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">hyper reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">um the the human consciousness that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">that lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">in modern society in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">is is out of its metaphysical depth and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">that explains a lot of confusion a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">of the anger because when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">metaphysical corners that&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">plateaus we can&#39;t even talk we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">even bridge across each other because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">common grounding of what reality is um</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">so i think somewhere here i have i have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">that uh gosh where was it um</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">the speciation i call the speciation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">digital humans</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">um that that the those who live just in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">the neocortical</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">um uh consciousness are</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">are speciating and not living embodied</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">lives uh and that makes it very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">turned into just you know we&#39;re jacking</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">ourselves into the matrix which is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">concept i&#39;m sure everyone here is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">familiar with so</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">all right let me start with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">metaphysics of quality um because i</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">think this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">uh different metaphysics and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">saying it&#39;s 100 right but i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">useful lens to pick up on some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">signals so robert persig most famously</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">wrote</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">the book zen in the art of motorcycle</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">maintenance and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">um in in that book he critiques what he</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">the uh subject object metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">and what that is is that this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">and then we are all perceivers of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">objective reality but on the side of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">and and we have a subjective frame that</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">we understand objective reality in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">and what he built out a little bit in um</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">he explored</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">why that kind of um classical approach</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">to it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">is is limiting in the book zen in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">art of moscow maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">and then in the in the um uh sequel</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">called lila he builds up what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">the metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s an interesting project that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">undertook because he by</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">by developing a metaphysics in the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">he did</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">he it kind of had a a built-in ethical</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">system like a moral system that fell out</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">which is interesting because that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">say that wow we can just</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">the way we choose to define reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">itself has baked in values and morals</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s a that&#39;s a kind of a weird</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">and interesting thing if it actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">so i just stole this picture from some</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">other dude who has a blog a vlog on</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">medium</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">about the metaphysical quality that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">probably worth going reading if this</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">interests you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">but what he said is very simple he said</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">that the world consists</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">of really two things there&#39;s static</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll define these words in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s static patterns of value and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">um uh there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of static</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">of value and there&#39;s this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">and what happens is that everything we</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">perceive what we call objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">rocks the sun um you know that fun</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">question of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">is there gravity is gravity a thing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">know the gravity exists before newton</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">like these kind of fun little philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">101 sort of questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">they they&#39;re they&#39;re uh confounding if</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">we use the classical</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">uh subject object metaphysics but in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">metaphysics of quality the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">there are layers there are patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">then there&#39;s additional patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">build upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">those underlying patterns and within any</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">pattern within any particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">level of frequency or kind of level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">if you put energy into it then it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">seek to organize it&#39;ll create more</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">structure and it&#39;ll create</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">it basically becomes a substrate for</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:15.280" style="s2">additional patterns another layer of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">patterns on top</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.280" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">and so the the way he cleaved this he</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">sort of had four he called it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">uh roughly um uh layers</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">if you will of static patterns the very</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">basic one is what we would call the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">and the inorganic patterns and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">things like rocks in the sun</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">you know the the computer that i&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">here and of course all of the atoms and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">molecules and everything inside your</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">on top of that there are biological</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">that are stable if the body if like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not in the middle of like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">plasma</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">ion cloud if you have stable physical</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">patterns like</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">atoms and molecules and they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">interacting with each other and bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">around and their biochemistry and all</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">this stuff is happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">it actually gives rise to another layer</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">of patterns that are stable as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s static pattern they form what</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">we call static patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">like the um the cell wall of a cell or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">like your bones</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">or whatever right so we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">each of these um layers if you will they</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">have their own homeostasis they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">their own sort of metabolism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">homeostasis they try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">and maintain structure if energy comes</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">that energy they take some of the energy</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">to maintain structure and the sun the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">energy it&#39;s funneled into</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">then providing life or providing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">dynamism at the next level up</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">and then on top of biological creatures</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">you build social and here&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">important thing a super important</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">aspect of the metaphysic metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">um things are don&#39;t just exist at one</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">pattern they exist across the stack</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">so you are not merely a pile of atoms</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">you are its yes and you are a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">atoms</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">and your biological creature and your</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">social creature and you are an</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">intellectual creature</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">and that idea that or the concept that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">ideas have people</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of this you are both a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">vibrating buzzing collection of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">trillions of atoms but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">and you respond to light and i shine</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">enough light at you you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">become a puff of like mostly oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">hydrogen and whatnot and carbon</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">but if i give you just enough light then</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">you get vitamin d which maintains</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">homeostasis for your body</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.919" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">which then you can become a vehicle for</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">balancing sound waves of other things</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">and if you guys bounce the sound waves</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">off of each other there&#39;s another layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">of pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">on top that we can get and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:23.520" style="s2">intellectual pattern so there&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">intellectual layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">so the metaphysics of quality says we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">are all of these things at once</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">and stability at one level gives rise as</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">a substrate</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">for patterns and dynamism the next level</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">every single layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">as you put energy into it it actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">surfaces something interesting at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">next layer and this is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">critique as a physicist from the second</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">law of thermodynamics we say well in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">closed system</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">uh things will tend you know entropy</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">will increase and everything will just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">kind of reach thermodynamic equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s for closed systems like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">earth is not a closed system you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">a closed system i&#39;m not a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">i&#39;m having some you know tea in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">so like what happens when there&#39;s energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">going to a non-closed system</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">well the physicists are useless about</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">this and yet this is literally every</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">system on earth</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">right there&#39;s no closed systems on earth</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of energy coming in</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s like gigawatts and gigawatts</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">booming at us from the sun</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">and that does stuff why don&#39;t we talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">about what that does and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">talks about sort of this and there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">i forget who was uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">shoot look at the name of the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">the guy who had that great quote that um</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">the flow of energy through a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">organizes the system</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">actually jim rutt like knows the guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">he&#39;s at santa fe institute uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">just his name slipped my mind but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">idea that when you do have energy the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">way the energy flows</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">creates structure um which is an entire</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">like an antithetical concept</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">from those who have a surface like uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">who got like the the cliffs notes of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">second law of thermodynamics we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">die heat death</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">well until we die he death what happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">right we get a bunch of energy from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">sun and all sorts of structure emerges</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">you&#39;d be hard-pressed to keep fungus</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">from growing if you put enough sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">and humidity on it right</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">so this is and so what what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">about persig here</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">is that humans then we have a cult we</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">have a biological mode a physical mode</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">we also have a cultural mode that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">mode and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">when you have enough socialization and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">this is kind of a cheesy view of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">world but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s i think directionally</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">correct when you have enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">socialization it gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">intellectualization</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">but these are different things and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">right here i&#39;ll stop right here and give</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">you one example why this is useful</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">if we look at all of the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">around cancel culture right now we look</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">at all of the people like oh it&#39;s a free</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">oh it&#39;s the left is becoming maoist red</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">guard is it this is it that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">all of that confounding anger and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">confusion and all these things i feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">like the conversation is quite broken</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">because people are basing on the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">metaphysics if you look at it from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">perspective of the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">what&#39;s offensive about using um</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">a social justice twitter mob to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">an idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">is that it inverts it&#39;s saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">energy of the social</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">layer gets to define and and um abrogate</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">or sort of usurp the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">of the intellectual plane to explore</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">what it wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">and so in the same way that so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">percy in his book actually he lays out</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">um that his ethical or moral system is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">it&#39;s unethical to kill or constrain</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">at the higher levels for the purposes of</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">right like you wouldn&#39;t go and say to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">someone i&#39;m sorry i have to kill you now</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">because i think your bones would make</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">really great they&#39;d be very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">as a structural member in my retaining</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">and using it to serve just a base</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">physical thing there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">harm done there there&#39;s some concept of</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">if you think about enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">liberalism and this idea of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">uh what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve said well</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">every person when they do pop their head</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">up into the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">layer or when we analyze them as an</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">intellectual agent or entity</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">they should have freedom as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">intellectual entity to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">others at the intellectual layer</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">when you come in and say oh no no only</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">people of this of this particular social</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">cast</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">or only people have bridged through and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">cross these particular social</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">gatekeepers by</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">you know kissing the right person</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">marrying the right person doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">they then have a right to espouse an</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">intellectual idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">that itself is ethically wrong it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">wrong and societies that structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">themselves themselves that way will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">ultimately they will be less capable</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">they&#39;ll be weaker they will be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">by societies that orient themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.080" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">accord to this</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">so um every layer oh i didn&#39;t talk much</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">about dynamic quality every layer</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">when it gets energy it has a thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">called it shoots for dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">things at the layer above but it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">hits a plateau of what it&#39;s able to do a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">plateau of complexity or</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">patterns it can you can sort of support</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">and so then the energy goes into forming</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">uh patterns to the next layer up and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">on so forth so this is kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">tiered step pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">if you will anyway so that was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">one thing he did say was um this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">important uh he tends to view it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">as a ratchet mechanism so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">is that the lower level</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">um a lower level pattern uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">layer when you get energy in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">the homeostasis or a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">metabolic systems at that layer</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">they&#39;re designed to allow um</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">innovation to kind of happen above while</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">trying to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">chaos and entropy from eroding it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">collapsing it to the layer below</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">and and he sees as he talks about as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">ratchet mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">and uh he gives an example in his book</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">a native american tribe um and the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">they cast this guy out</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">as uh as a as a freak um because he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">seen as a chaos agent and actually we</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2">get this anyone plays d</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">d and and knows about alignments right</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">there&#39;s chaos chaotic evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">as well as chaotic good and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">being lawful</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">is that you&#39;re part of the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">you&#39;re lawful you&#39;re trying to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">thing from slipping backwards</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">and you cannot discern what of the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">is good and what the chaos is bad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">just all beyond a fog beyond your ooda</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">loop beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">ability to discern you&#39;re just one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">these lawful people trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">the trying to try to keep the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">alive right you just don&#39;t want to slip</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">back into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">and this same dynamic manifests and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">pokes its head up</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">in a number of those things that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">showed on the very first slide you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">see it in the gervais theory</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">you can see it in a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">other things where</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">the forces of or actually uh shirky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">law right every institution</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">ultimately becomes uh perpetuates the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">problem it was designed</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">to to solve right um and also in jerry</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">cornell&#39;s iron law of bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">uh all of these things they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">this ratchet mechanism essentially at</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">the social layer</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">an institution of bureaucracy or</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">whatever will tend to ossify</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">around the the defense of the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">and that same thing that keeps it from</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">slipping backwards</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">also fights every possible innovation</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">agent because it sees it all as forces</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s another way that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">metaphysics of quality kind of you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">hear that mode resonating through all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">these other ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">um that&#39;s why i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">important one and again it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">talked about very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">uh anymore because personally was a big</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">deal for maybe two generations back</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">not so much for our current generation</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">now one thing i would say though is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">when we think about it as a ratchet and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">things like that it is again very easy</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">to think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">objects and things as being just at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">layer or this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">this thing at the social layer this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">this thing at the biological layer</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">when in fact we have to remember it it</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">is waves of different frequencies all</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:37.039" style="s2">overlapping all at once</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">all of us are little water molecules</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">everything in the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">is uh can be viewed as a stack of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">um it resonates at all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">different layers so well i mean sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">up to its top layer right so my camera</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">that i&#39;m looking at right now is not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">biological thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">but it is um you know it is a it is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">physical object now where this gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">interesting when you talk about when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">look at it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">when you look at some of these other</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">technological society</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">philosophers is that they would they</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">would sort of put an asterisk on that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">and say well no</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">um a camera or a smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">or a sword or you know jared diamonds</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">guns from steel whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">all of these inanimate objects that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">use that we call technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">they actually they they&#39;re not just our</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">static artifacts at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">physical layer they are in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">transform</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">these these these uh objects or beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">that exist at a social layer at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">intellectual layer</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">and so there is a lot more richness</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">than this is a simple chart but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">a whole lot more interaction up and down</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">the stack a whole lot more ringing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.159" style="s2">vibrating</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">than this kind of simple clean cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">would uh would would imply so i&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">any questions about that how did that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">how was that for you was that useful or</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">was quite a treat um</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a few questions uh angen um</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">you have a clarifying question if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">clarifying one</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">um zero you could do that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">slower i didn&#39;t quite understand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">quality fit in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">or the ratchet or how like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">thermodynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">flow um meshed with the model</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:30.799" style="s2">oh sorry the the concept of quality you</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">mean i</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.799" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">i just is there like an explanation five</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">version of what you just did</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">um let me think about how to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">i went through a lot of stuff so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">guys that was that was definitely just</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">like a spew of things</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">um the reason it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">is because uh really it&#39;s a personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">that persic tells in his first book in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">zen of the art of motorcycle maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">um and we tend to think of quality as an</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">adjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">right oh is this are you doing quality</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">work right um</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">and he was a professor at university of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">montana bozeman</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">and his i guess his um secretary would</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">ask him every day just a nice old lady</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">you know good morning dr persig are you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">do you know are you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">are you doing quality are you teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">quality today or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">she&#39;d keep asking this question and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of he started thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">well what the hell&#39;s quality mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">what is good um all of us we use the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">word quality and good as adjectives and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">pithy way of of saying the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">um persec&#39;s idea here is that quality is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">a noun</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s an adjective it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">noun and all of these things he calls</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">them static patterns of value</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">you can also call them um static quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">versus dynamic quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">and our intuitive sense like if someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">gives you a piece of art</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">and says is this quality well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:53.279" style="s2">like well i don&#39;t know is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">are you just asking me to judge well i</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.279" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">like it so i guess yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">we are setting ourselves in a subject</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">object metaphysics mind to say well</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">there&#39;s objective properties i could say</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">is this art piece is a sculpture blue</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">and you would say yes of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">blue um i would say is it transparent</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">and you say no it&#39;s not transparent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">solid blue right and i&#39;d say is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">quality and you would say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">subjective i think it&#39;s quality you may</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">not think it&#39;s quality</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s called the subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">object metaphysics but if you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">about this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">you know is it blue well kind of depends</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">on you know the actual receptors in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">in your eyeball it also is a transparent</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">depends on if you&#39;re looking at it in</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">radio frequency right or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">looking at it in light and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">characteristics that we think are</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">objective that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">actually subjective properties and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">then the real like brain</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">kind of twist is to say that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">things that we think of as subjective</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">and this is where it gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">post-modern but uh especially that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">quality of or that property of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">is it good is it quality there his</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">is actually taking this perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">quality is an</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">objective thing if you will it&#39;s a noun</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">things have</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">quality to them and when they get energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">they try to build more quality but they</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">hit a certain level and the next level</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">of quality</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">things they can emerge they have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">different structure to them and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">layers there&#39;s a layer cake</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">of quality but it&#39;s all it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">all good it&#39;s all goodness</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">and and it&#39;s a really and i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">summarize two books in just like five</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">but that&#39;s you you can disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">that you said that sounds like a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">crap like a bunch of pomo whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very interesting lens to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">on to look at the world to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">what if the world and and for those of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">you who are maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">uh believe in you know have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">spirituality uh that you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">um what if the world actually is trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">to express</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">godliness what if it&#39;s actually striving</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">for good</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">as an absolute value because</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">like i said life is interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">unstoppable when you start putting</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">energy into things</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">if you we see wolfram&#39;s book right just</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">in the raw math</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">on iterated systems and cellular</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">patterns emerge where did that come from</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">and you know when um pat ryan was on</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">uh maybe a couple months ago and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">talked about hyper real numbers having a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">life to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">this is where it gets into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">metaphysical aspect of like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">what if the very structure of reality is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">everything is striving for good but they</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">strive for it not in a linear fashion</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">but in this kind of stag</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">sort of a cigarette fashion right um</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">wow that&#39;s actually a very weird way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">look at the world but</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">it gives you some tools that are not</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">available if you don&#39;t use that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">approach to say that this you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">can actually say</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">you know this is this is what um ethical</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">harm looks like here&#39;s what ethical good</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">looks like on the basis of are we</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">we letting things strive for dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">from within their static plane i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">know if that helped if that confused</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">things but but the the net net is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">quality is a noun not an adjective</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">and then your comment about</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">thermodynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">adding energy to a system how does that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">fit this striving towards goodness</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">well um yeah the way it fits is that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">the and he actually does talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">in his book as well uh that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">when we think about systems and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">behavior of systems um</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">uh we we we know about the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">thermodynamics which says that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">closed systems will eventually erode</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">into or a road</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">they&#39;ll decay into just everything is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">evil equal temperature background noise</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">of like nothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">or of like you know just background</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">everything&#39;s undifferentiated high</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">entropy</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">now uh what he says the critique is well</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">what what if there&#39;s not what is not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">closed system what if we look at a thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">we say well</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">we can draw some you know dashed lines</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">and say here&#39;s a system but it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">energy in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s getting energy pumped in what</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">happens in a non-closed system</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">and what happens is structure emerges</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">always and everywhere so you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">about spin glasses you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">theory of chaos you can look at cellular</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">automata</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">and those are kind of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">things if you look at the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">around you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">right um he has a great i&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">now but in this book he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">chemistry professors</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">sitting on rocks baking in the sun and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like the theory of thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s a closed system says that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">things just decay into pile of goo but</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">what we actually see is that the earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">produces him one of my favorite quotes</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">when i was a freshman in college i</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">discovered this quote that stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">all my life</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">and it says that um it&#39;s also one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">these like little brain</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">brain teaser things uh man was invented</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">by water</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">to carry itself uphill</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">and that statement is true here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">here&#39;s the f&#39;d up thing that statement</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">is true</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">and it also talks it&#39;s this man was</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">invented</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">by water to carry itself uphill</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">let that sit with you for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s why this stands in contrast</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">with the second law of thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">because in in non-equilibrium states if</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">look at what happens you get a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">of water making man</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an interesting thing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">so his metaphysical quality is to talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">about at least give us a starting point</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">what are the layers of structure as</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">energy flows through a system and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">organizes the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">what do those organizations look like</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">and they tend to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">pattern that&#39;s where the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">is so important that they will surface</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">things things will emerge patterns will</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:21.599" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">they&#39;ll stabilize but the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">that stabilizes that pattern and keeps</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">it alive</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">and fights off the forces of entropy</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">trying to reduce it back down to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">it is also fighting the forces of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">innovation and things that might take it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">to the next level</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">and what bridges it across that that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">know what gets us that next hump</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">um that&#39;s you might hear you know brett</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">weinstein or jordan talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">crossing an adaptive valley right jim</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">rod same thing we talk about crossing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">adaptive valley we talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">in the in the context of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">systems and biology and biological</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">systems but</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">med but the person&#39;s metaphysics talks</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">about this as a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">general kind of thing so you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">it as as face structured and crystalline</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">solids you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">you know metastable things and and spin</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">glasses it&#39;s it&#39;s a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">uh when you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">non-equilibrium dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">does that again does that help answer do</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">you have a follow-on</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind me a quick follow-on</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">to paraphrase so basically if you like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">pour energy into an open system</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">and you kind of just jump like you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">shaking the puzzle box you&#39;ll just start</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">to see some puzzle pieces fit together</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">per sig&#39;s point is the way that things</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">fit together and then emerge</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">into a layer and then emerge into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">layer um</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of like a teloteleological</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost like going towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:44.839" style="s2">goodness yes his way of calling goodness</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">is quality</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.839" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">yes exactly and every layer has its own</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">view of what that goodness is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">and the same its own view of goodness</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">that defends itself and keeps it from</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">collapsing back</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">actually also impedes the next layer of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">goodness emerging</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the ratchet is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">what the ratchet is exactly and and as</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">you were talking about it as you pour</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">energy into a system i just thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">about this um</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">wonderful setup maybe you guys have seen</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">this in science museums but um i i first</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">saw it at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">science museum in berlin but you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">just take a piece of flat uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">piece of like thin sheet of sheet metal</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">and you pour a bunch of random sand on</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">it if you take</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">a cello bow a cheap one hopefully and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">you just like</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">strum it along the side at a freak at a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">constant frequency</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">on the side of this metal plate you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">get patterns you&#39;ll get shapes of sand</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll dance and if you vary the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">frequency they&#39;ll shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">and they&#39;ll sort of form one pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">then as you do it kind of at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">frequency it&#39;ll sort of like be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">messy and they&#39;ll shift into another</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">you can also look for youtube videos of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">what happens when people put plates</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">or glass or thin things on top of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">speaker and they pour sand on and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">turn on the speaker to some</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">you see the pattern shifting around</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s essentially this thing um</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">and this is what ties into then</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">four dimensionalism time frequency and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">the metaphysical basis of reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">and the temporality of it um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s also tied to this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">they get another deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">metaphysical connection</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">but but yes you summarize very well</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">thank you both peters feel free</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">to boot me from asking another follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:16.800" style="s2">but i think i&#39;m missing why the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">emerges like why is it this inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.800" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but it seems to um i see it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">in organizations i try to sell them</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">software i see it in communities you see</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">it in in uh human</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">societies i mean it&#39;s an aspect of human</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">socialization but i feel like if i</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">if i try to uh use this and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">world this way i can see a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">i use as a hammer i find a lot of nails</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting why isn&#39;t just a smooth</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">continuous linear thing all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">to goodness</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">right i don&#39;t know good question</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">all right um rain you had a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">and statements uh is anything still</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">alive for you just wanted to check in</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">um my question was answered so if there</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">are other questions go for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">uh margaret you got a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">yeah my question is i&#39;m hearing and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">trying to assess how accurate my</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">understanding is but an implication</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">that flow is largely unidirectional</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">and not in that the exact direction is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">uh determined but the general like</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">flow of movement of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">about of the order flowing up</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">through the layers giving rise to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">layers and then trying to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">entropy and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">in the lower layers that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">general sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">of movement in a specific direction and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.400" style="s2">though it may be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">work against that there&#39;s like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.400" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">energy incentives</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">to move with that flow is that accurate</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">um it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">that um helps to illustrate why my</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">description was a bit flawed</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">and so so i would say that the um the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">thing i didn&#39;t articulate</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">i think maybe very clearly is that um</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">even though we talk about patterns</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">emerging and uh and and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">hard with language not to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">um sort of latent value when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">about oh this is going up</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s higher and therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">better um the idea here is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">these things all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">these patterns emerge stacked on top of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s more of an emergence</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like does</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">this system did it emerge a biological</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">sort of homeostatic uh homeostasis layer</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">and if it did that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">does this system it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:51.839" style="s2">playing the game spore and you start</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">with like some like you know gray goo</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">or like little protozoa and they try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">form multicellular societies and things</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s um again with our subject</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.319" style="s2">object metaphysics we try to take a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">knife and cut the world into things with</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.319" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re either a thing or not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">but what the metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">encourages you to think about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.599" style="s2">why i have a picture of water waves</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re a molecule in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.599" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">water you can have waves of many</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">different frequencies all</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">going through you at once right if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">think about a point</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">um you know at the intersection of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">two ripple patterns that point</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.800" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">is part of both waves at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">and in here</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">when that energy comes in um new</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">kinds of patterns one could call them</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">higher order modes or</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">or higher frequency or they require a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">certain higher amount of energy in order</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">to sustain themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">um and in that way they&#39;re higher</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">like you don&#39;t get there unless you put</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">higher amounts of energy and sustain</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">that at some frequency</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">but um but that&#39;s that&#39;s what so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">not a flow</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">up like that it&#39;s more of these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">emerge does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">yeah yes it does and thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">reframe um</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">i was using the flow up because i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">looking at that pyramid model yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">exactly i guess maybe my my question</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">which one i&#39;m hearing is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">like the direction itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">important but that there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">i guess what i&#39;m trying to clarify is</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">what i hear is that there&#39;s directional</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">movement happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">within like if you&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">cellular level on that level but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">also this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">overall sense of movement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">happening for</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">all the interconnected layers which has</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">a general vector um and then within that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">like collection there&#39;s also all these</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">different directional movements</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">happening on</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:48.839" style="s2">many different levels and interacting</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">yes yes there&#39;s um there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">uh yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">one something you said there in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">middle</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">it is it is that the lower levels will</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">give rise to higher levels right and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">higher levels will try to sap energy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">organize the lower levels and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">interplay this is that that struggle and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">the tension in the ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">um and so but it all ha it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of and and we can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">ourselves in as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">um being part of like if you ask what</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">was my identity well i have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;m this particular part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">physical space if you take a knife and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">cut off one of my fingers i would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">well part of i&#39;m a lesser me now</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">because i&#39;m losing if i&#39;ve lost a finger</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">a node in an intellectual network i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">person in a social kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">uh cohesive thing here you know my</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">family and so i&#39;m all of these all at</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m allocating energy across these</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">in my own</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">embodied life and this is where this</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">then kind of takes us maybe as a segue</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">to the next topic about how this ties to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.079" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">every human being is all of these all at</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">right you can&#39;t ignore your physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">safety and your physical self i mean in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">a sense this does mirror maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">hierarchy a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">right you want to defend your physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">space and the physical integrity of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">then there&#39;s the biological integrity</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">like if you really got to go use the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">bathroom or if you&#39;re really really</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">hungry and you need to eat</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a biological integrity if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.160" style="s2">need to breathe you&#39;re going to really</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">work to get more oxygen right</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.160" end="00:46:15.359" style="s2">but then above that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">social needs and there&#39;s an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.359" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">dynamic that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">and all of these things are flowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">through us at once and we have to manage</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">the interplay of these things</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">um we can&#39;t just be all living in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">forebrain being like i&#39;m just this</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">avatar on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">and look how many upvotes and likes i</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">have or look how many instagram</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">followers i got</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not living an embodied life and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;re ignoring these other needs and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">you&#39;re allocating energy up into</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">a social pseudo-intellectual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">so this is this is i think if you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">about the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">self like in the whole human self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">also a good way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just energy going into</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">only going up but it&#39;s it&#39;s allocating</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">and balancing</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">the energies and energy allocations</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">across the whole stack does that make</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">that does thank you yes great</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">um should we should we any other</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">comments that you want to highlight</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">peter or</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">um so we have about 10 minutes of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">of time we can go a little bit over</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s up to you we have enough more</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">questions or you want to um</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">because this is exactly to uh i&#39;m sorry</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">um yes yes margaret so this is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">picture i had</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">uh for that kind of speaks to this point</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">you know this little oval is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">represent</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">uh the self each of us and these</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">different colored</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">circles are um modes or components or</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">at different layers and different levels</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">of the the persig metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">uh so we have different biological needs</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">we have different social needs and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">intellectual things</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s tension between them they</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">kind of jostle around</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">um we are really a society of self uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">but anyway let&#39;s put that picture up</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">there okay i mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">uh other other questions and thoughts i</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">can go and touch on a different topic</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">now we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">the metaphysics of quality um so we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">nine minutes left you want to end it off</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">with one more question and we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">oh sure yeah let&#39;s do that yeah uh rain</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:14.079" style="s2">uh i believe you you&#39;ve dropped two</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">questions um</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.079" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">in the chat yeah now the first one</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">should be pretty quick</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">um is this like pretty uh kind of basic</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">integral theory all quadrants all levels</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">all lines</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">right the the um quadra i forget what</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">word he uses</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">that everything manifests within</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">inner outer uh singular plural</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">yes i think there&#39;s uh yes i when i and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">i have not</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">gone deep on integral theory and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">been a little while i actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve got the little chart uh it was just</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">sort of related to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">oh actually the green is filling in</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">but um but i think yes the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">from what i recall as i was first</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">looking into integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">there was definitely a lot of resonance</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">with these concepts um</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how much i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">there was an influence or not i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">really know but</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">um but yeah i think i think those those</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">concepts are quite are those</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">kind of bodies of work are quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">resonant with each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">yeah it seems like they&#39;re they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">ideas that go back to um</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">the neoplatonists and and then later</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">um de chardin and orobindo</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">um like the hierarchy of being sounds</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually forgotten much of the dish</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">i did now but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">um one of the things that unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">i think personally does not spend as</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">much time talking about is you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">there&#39;s just so much subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">and nuance oh what&#39;s going on come on</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">um within that the social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">stacks there&#39;s so much nuance um of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:00.559" style="s2">interactions there</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">um he doesn&#39;t spend as much time talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.559" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">about developing</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">a model of the human psyche uh although</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">ironically he spends most the first book</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">talking about his own mental breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">electroshock therapy uh but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">what like uh metzinger would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">thomas messinger and his model of</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">uh the ego tunnel and um the emergence</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">from that critique perspective you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">also see it from our heidi smith model</p>

<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">um and you can see this in that you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">see this in um actually vancat&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">gervais theory the reason kind of wrote</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">it right under your base theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">within um companies maybe next time i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">talk about your base theory a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">more which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">fantastic for those who are not familiar</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">with it um but within companies you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">got sociopaths at the top</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.880" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the clueless in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got the um</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">the uh the losers the people who know</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">they have no franchise in the system at</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">and your domestic class kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">mandarins um</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">in the in the heidi smith model they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">in that middle they&#39;re in the middle to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">keep the other people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">in line so you can see reflections of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:32.799" style="s2">bryce of bryce heidi smith&#39;s uh thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.520" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">through many of these other things as</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">well so i&#39;ll leave it at that any</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">questions or or comments on that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">do you see this mapping over to uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">samuel bergeron&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">kind of live player dead player uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">if you&#39;re familiar with that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">that familiar with it can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:52.079" style="s2">just give me like the yeah essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">live player</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.079" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">is someone uh as an individual a group</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2">of people who can create things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t been created before in a dead</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">player because basically only can follow</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">a script</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m wondering if that maps</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">over to the the wild entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">or can a domestic person be a live</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:10.240" style="s2">player too in a certain context</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">well this is where this is great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">so they are a live player at a different</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:17.200" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">right they&#39;re playing at defending the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.200" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">static level down here</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">the wild type the live player in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">framework as you described it</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">they&#39;re pushing liveness up to the next</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">layer they&#39;re trying to explore what</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">options are available at the next layer</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">here and the live player in</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">what might be called a dead player i</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">guess they&#39;re actually a live player</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">within the strata</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">right um uh susan you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">about mental models and more foundation</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:54.000" style="s2">or any other question you&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">um yes uh so</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">i guess that question alone in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:03.839" style="s2">um is do you see a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">um and when i say moral foundations i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.839" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">not talking about a particular theory as</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">much as i am</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">um the uh just the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:14.880" style="s2">the when we get into moral foundations</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:16.839" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.880" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">it sounds like we&#39;re starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.839" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">a a more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">view that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.240" end="00:59:31.920" style="s2">more about ideals and you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">get into you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.920" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">the ideal of what we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:39.440" style="s2">about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">uh where somebody values compliance for</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">that&#39;s do you see that kind of as being</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:49.520" style="s2">you know a a node within mental models</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">but is there a way to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">to take that up a level i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">where i&#39;d kind of like to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">right where i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">fascinated with is how we get people to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">move from um just perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">taking to perspective seeking</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">uh-huh and um and and i love your</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">passion</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">about all of this and so it was like if</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:18.400" style="s2">we could just kind of bottle that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">and get people excited about um how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.400" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">what is the value to you because i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">that a lot of people kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">when they hear these terms they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">shut down because they think well</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">you know i&#39;m stupid because i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">that and and so yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">all of a sudden their energy starts</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">getting wrapped up in their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">shame and ignorance and that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">point so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">can you speak to that yes absolutely um</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">and i&#39;ll go and i&#39;ll go in sequence here</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">um so the first thing you asked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">the moral foundation theory i do mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">that in a very precise sense of jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">hates</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">uh in his book uh the righteous mind um</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">is uh just uh it was fantastic um and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:01:00.000" style="s2">he identifies uh he says you know we</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.000" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">know the subtitle for that book is</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">why good people are divided by politics</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">and religion right i mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">person a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">thinks that they&#39;re standing up for</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">these virtues person b thinks they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">stand for these virtues why they hate</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">each other&#39;s guts</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">right literally they&#39;re shooting each</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">other in the streets yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">it&#39;s we don&#39;t recognize it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">if we argue if food is delicious or not</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">so he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">this is a little pomo because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">saying there isn&#39;t an absolute like this</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">is absolutely the right way to think</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">right and he actually is a liberal guy</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:30.559" style="s2">who went to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">think from chicago and he went to um he</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.559" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">studied in india and looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">structure society there</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:36.960" style="s2">where there you know respect for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">family is so important in the eastern</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">cultures right you are not an individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">really you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">a node in an unbroken chain in a family</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">unit</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">and the family&#39;s needs are really</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">important part of what you should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s so different than the american</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">model of individuality</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:55.520" style="s2">um but he went and studied this and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">wrote this book</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.520" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">and he called and i&#39;ve shared on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">screen here the five moral foundations</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">and he describes it as almost like</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">flavors like we go into different parts</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">of the world you get food that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">different flavors</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s no saying that thai food is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">the wrong flavor and cajun food is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">right flavor right</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we are trained to taste</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:14.799" style="s2">certain kinds of flavors in fact think</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.880" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">about food in certain kinds of flavors</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.799" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">and a lot of eastern cooking has umami</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">in it that umami flavor has a sick</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">flavor right kind of was all over the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">foodie</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">web in the last you know over 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">so in his sense it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:28.480" style="s2">he talks about these five foundations</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">and then they have um they have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.480" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">opposite thing like a thing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">that is the if you lack that particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:35.599" style="s2">moral thing if you violate that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">moral foundation</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.599" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">and what you identify was actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">there&#39;s two higher order clusters</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s a person focused there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">very uh individual focused</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">individualizing cluster care</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">fairness that tends to be what the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">modern liberal</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">kind of mentality is those on the left</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">the progressives</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a very strong obsession with</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:55.839" style="s2">fairness but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">binding cluster as well people who want</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.839" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">loyalty authority sanctity purity</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.559" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">um that&#39;s another cluster and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:05.520" style="s2">and so he looks at kind of it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">book i would just recommend you know if</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.520" end="01:03:09.359" style="s2">you&#39;re interested reading that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">um these moral foundations do give rise</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.359" end="01:03:12.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">other things right so we can use this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.240" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">and incorporate this thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">until we look at the arc heidi smith</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">model the people who sit there and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">defend</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">um they defend the domesticated class</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">the bureaucrats</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">you know there&#39;s bureaucrats on both</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">moral sides</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">right on the one side you might have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:30.559" style="s2">bureaucrat or a domestic type saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:33.359" style="s2">we need to do it this way because this</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.559" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">is fair this is this is the fair way to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.359" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">do it someone else might say we do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">this way because we&#39;ve always done away</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">this is the way the founding fathers</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">wrote it and intended it</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s tradition um and in both</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">cases though they&#39;re domestic class</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">because they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of um</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">holding the status quo a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">right so you can sort of combine this</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">with the other it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:58.319" style="s2">um again it adds the flavor of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.319" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">which is that how do we get people to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">perspective seeking</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">and this does then tie to um</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:13.039" style="s2">well one of the things here let me share</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">this screen let&#39;s share again</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.039" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">oh my god is there a way to save the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">chat logs because i do want to go back</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">and read all of them but i</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">haven&#39;t uh yeah i can send it to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">okay that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">um and then we can talk about them in</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">the discord i love discord so</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">um here so when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.319" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">perspectives and getting people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">to be comfortable thinking about all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">stuff and getting into all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">um when we think about the the stack of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">like the metaphysics of quality</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">or master&#39;s hierarchy when you just go</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">with maslow if you&#39;re not uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.599" style="s2">stable at the bottom layers right if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:44.400" style="s2">have needs or if you have childhood</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.599" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">traumas</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.400" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">or you have constant present traumas</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">all of these things make it really hard</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">for you to have smooth sailing</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">and to go and reach out and be open</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">you&#39;re using all of your energy</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">emotional psychic physical</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:02.319" style="s2">all of it to maintain homeostasis like</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">to be just a coherent human being</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.319" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to you know drive</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">resonance between all these different</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">layers of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:09.599" style="s2">um or drive just maintain coherence</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">between these different layers of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.599" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">um and if we can basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">create a social structure that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">harm children</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t traumatize them uh then we</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">can build a cycle of goodness</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:25.839" style="s2">uh this is there&#39;s a little line i have</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:28.480" style="s2">in the next slide here where i say</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.839" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">quality generativity is quality that</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.480" end="01:05:33.039" style="s2">attracts quality</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">my view on game b and jim rutt has um</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.039" end="01:05:37.119" style="s2">uh generously um uh not generously but</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">he&#39;s i&#39;m very glad to see that he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">reflected some of this</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">uh the the goal of the game the effort</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">now is to create</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">some infrastructure to allow us to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:48.079" style="s2">good parents to the next generation</p>

<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">um so someone in service of fairness can</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:37.680" style="s2">sort of like preserving thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">um or you can be the wild type to say</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.680" end="01:07:40.799" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go and seek fairness</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:42.559" style="s2">just directly with empathy out in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.799" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">world with people right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.559" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">this yeah and i guess that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">of where</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">it and yeah this is uh maybe a myopic</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:55.039" style="s2">view but</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">but the if we if we talk about mental</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.039" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">um then for me it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:06.400" style="s2">um moral agnostic because</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">once we start interjecting these</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.400" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">particular morals</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:11.920" style="s2">then that&#39;s taking us down a rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.920" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">what morals are right or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">do you agree with that um</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">sort of so the reason for sharing</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">the moral foundations theory is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:29.199" style="s2">i think it is a good mental model</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:30.799" style="s2">because then you can help understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.199" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">what&#39;s motivating this person why</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.799" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">do they disagree with me um it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:37.359" style="s2">way to use a richer language to talk</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">about and get through this agreement so</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.359" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why i think the moral foundations</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:43.679" style="s2">theory itself</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">is is a mental model when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.679" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">specific things being good or bad you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:52.400" style="s2">right that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:54.000" style="s2">no longer an agnostic tool however</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.400" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear to me that the agnostic</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.000" end="01:08:57.120" style="s2">tools are necessarily the right ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">what if there actually is a moral order</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.120" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">to the universe</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:02.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m not doubting that i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">trying to and maybe yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.560" end="01:09:07.040" style="s2">where what comes to mind for me is</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">saying you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:10.640" style="s2">maybe what i&#39;m talking about is more of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.799" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">a meta meta model</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.640" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">okay and you&#39;re in and so there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.759" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">obviously many many mental models and</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:20.319" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:21.440" style="s2">in fact if you just say that as someone</p>

<p begin="01:11:32.960" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">opposed to focusing it inward to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.159" end="01:11:37.120" style="s2">tribalism and defense</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2">and bunker mentality and protection they</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.120" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">can take that energy to something above</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">so hopefully that addresses your answers</p>

<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:18.080" style="s2">let&#39;s play it by ear and just be</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:20.400" style="s2">you know i think we&#39;re gonna have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.080" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">of fun in the discord and then um</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:25.840" style="s2">next next week i mean i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">it would be if i get my my thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.840" end="01:12:29.280" style="s2">stuff together on paper</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:30.800" style="s2">um a good description and discussion of</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.280" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">four dimensionalism</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.800" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">um the uh maybe a little preview of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.760" end="01:12:36.159" style="s2">gervais theory for people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">you know are not familiar with this are</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.159" end="01:12:39.520" style="s2">really great um</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">yeah a couple of things like that might</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.520" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">be fun uh one one sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:46.880" style="s2">thought and question for everyone to</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">ponder as we wrap this up</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.880" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">is you know what does it mean for</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:53.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:56.239" style="s2">can we really observe and perceive</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.120" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">something that happens only once</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:13:03.199" style="s2">um and my uh my</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.280" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">my my thesis is that the the human brain</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.199" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">fundamentally operates on frequencies</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:08.719" style="s2">and something happens only once has an</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">infinite frequency or a</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.719" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">non-defined frequency you&#39;re waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">the next thing to happen again</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">but but the world is nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:20.239" style="s2">a sequence of singular events and our</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:22.719" style="s2">patterning engine requires</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">structures and repetition and patterns</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.719" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">and frequencies</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">so this gets to the four dimensionalism</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">and to thinking about temporality force</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">landry some good some of this but</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">i&#39;ll just leave everything with that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">question can we really perceive</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">something that happens</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:38.239" style="s2">once zero one infinity</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">very cool um so thank you peter uh for</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.239" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">coming today</p>

<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a link to the discord um and i</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.159" end="01:13:51.679" style="s2">was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:52.239" style="s2">like i i do this thing called on anki on</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.679" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">my phone</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.239" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">sex uh it&#39;s like yeah memorization tool</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">for space repetition they use trace</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:13:58.640" style="s2">repetition to help memorize</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">i have like my mental models on there</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.640" end="01:14:02.480" style="s2">and i kind of do it it&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">rhizome when you have like one mental</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.480" end="01:14:05.360" style="s2">model following another then you find a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">connection between two and just triggers</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.360" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">things</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">create like a mental model like</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">channel and the discord and then we kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">of collect some mental models that</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">peter&#39;s talking about we find our own</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:17.679" style="s2">and maybe have some exercises or</p>
