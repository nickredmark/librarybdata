<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">anything but there was the one point</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">where the guy called in and was asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.500" style="s2">questions so there was a point where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">was talking about Facebook like I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.500" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">just that click can I have like just</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">conversation I might figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">download that I was watching a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">bit I thought it was fascinating I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">to rewatch it because I missed some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">it but I didn&#39;t put it on the agenda but</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:26.299" style="s2">I did think it was interesting trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">explain it to him and to see where he</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.299" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">interpreted differently so I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">know if you&#39;re up to up for it but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">would like to maybe even craft that a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">little bit more I have some ideas yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">I&#39;m up for their first later write</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">anything and everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">radiantly tech cooperative it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">everyone a microphone yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">are doing in 2020 which is like what are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">you doing tomorrow it&#39;s gonna be a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">first step I mean doing the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">project crazy it&#39;s gonna hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">catalyze not on the first day but</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">something out of it it&#39;s gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">oh we all have the same problems how and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">that he was like oh you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">piggyback on their funding and I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying crowdsource</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">funding like we all have the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">problem so if we can figure out funding</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">one time if we can figure out marketing</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">one time for one meta project that can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:29.010" style="s2">you know mean then give grants out and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">like if people better want to say worth</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.010" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">it but that seems wrong but people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">are worth it ubi right like interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">or having a conversation with James</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.320" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">this because this is very important and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:49.700" style="s2">having people be able to work on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:52.380" style="s2">projects that are important to them</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.700" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">without needing to worry you know more</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.860" style="s2">and actually have amazing projects of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">them help them crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.860" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">crowdsourcing to the next roadblock and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">an extra minute yes yeah reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:26.940" style="s2">friction for all other people that want</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">being part of the conversation of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.900" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">what does a technology company look like</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">that we run together that&#39;s today this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">morning&#39;s conversation was supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">be with just four about fractal</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:52.739" style="s2">democracy I don&#39;t know if you saw his</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:54.810" style="s2">posting game on it they got my instead</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">works but I love fractal and like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">exponential growth young but like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">where with this I was like well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">just find ten people and they&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">ten people and they&#39;ll find ten people</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work that way because ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">people all ten of them don&#39;t know ten</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">people who know ten we don&#39;t defend</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">people one in ten people knows hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">people right and then that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:22.990" style="s2">how it works but we&#39;ve rescheduled my</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:25.389" style="s2">Congress</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.990" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">next Wednesday so instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.389" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">right before our board convenes right</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:31.860" style="s2">before my Omega rural conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:38.380" style="s2">that&#39;s life now</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.860" end="00:04:40.180" style="s2">conversation upon conversations so do</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">you want do you mind if I share kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:46.259" style="s2">my ideas on a little bit more phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:49.900" style="s2">so I was thinking that really our focus</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.259" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">I want to make sure that we&#39;re enticing</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.900" end="00:04:55.599" style="s2">to people that aren&#39;t techies aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:04:57.430" style="s2">developers right because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.599" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">the audience that we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.430" end="00:05:01.750" style="s2">build because you know if they have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:03.669" style="s2">funding then you can always hire devs</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:08.440" style="s2">it&#39;d be nice to have passionate devs but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.669" end="00:05:14.470" style="s2">you can always hire people so we use the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.440" end="00:05:17.319" style="s2">term build a cooperative I was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.470" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">wondering if there&#39;s a way to say I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.319" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">really what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:30.039" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a community right that then</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:33.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know here&#39;s a bad right a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.039" end="00:05:39.969" style="s2">brainstorms and funds you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.550" end="00:05:41.830" style="s2">technology that is for them and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.969" end="00:05:44.860" style="s2">could say by its just wouldn&#39;t we say by</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.830" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">them afraid that people are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.860" end="00:05:49.780" style="s2">that it&#39;d be more attractive to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:52.810" style="s2">developers than to the average person we</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.780" end="00:05:56.349" style="s2">want to make sure it&#39;s enticing to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.810" end="00:05:57.639" style="s2">average person yes no and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.349" end="00:06:00.969" style="s2">difficulty with a lot of the language</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.639" end="00:06:02.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like like I started when I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.969" end="00:06:03.789" style="s2">we can create a technology company that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.380" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">will save developing for like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.789" end="00:06:07.900" style="s2">cool that&#39;s not a thing that&#39;s won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:10.599" style="s2">work don&#39;t know like how do I give you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.900" end="00:06:13.389" style="s2">all of this vision in one sentence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.599" end="00:06:15.190" style="s2">not gonna happen it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.389" end="00:06:16.509" style="s2">technology&#39;s powerful it&#39;s risky and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.190" end="00:06:18.340" style="s2">it&#39;s more powerful and less risky</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.509" end="00:06:20.949" style="s2">together and we can do basically</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.330" end="00:06:35.710" style="s2">cause in it and it is is really the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.930" end="00:06:36.129" style="s2">hardest part I think it&#39;s just hard in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.710" end="00:06:39.449" style="s2">all the</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.309" end="00:06:45.939" style="s2">very different ideas but the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.199" end="00:08:25.509" style="s2">surround them yeah I guess yeah part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.679" end="00:08:27.909" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is is helping them with</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.909" end="00:08:32.709" style="s2">a space to be heard and they could build</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.699" end="00:08:34.029" style="s2">that if it&#39;s an idea that that does</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.709" end="00:08:37.269" style="s2">spark interest and hopefully we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.029" end="00:08:41.560" style="s2">helping them also if they want to craft</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.269" end="00:08:43.630" style="s2">that narrative in these meetings by just</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.560" end="00:08:46.689" style="s2">simply asking questions and clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:47.800" style="s2">things so so yeah we&#39;re already doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.689" end="00:08:49.490" style="s2">that part of the community</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.800" end="00:08:51.770" style="s2">tackling they&#39;ll kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">who want to help to know about how they</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:05.480" style="s2">can help you not convincing people they</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.010" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">never had yeah a lot of this stuff it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:14.600" style="s2">acknowledged E and people have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.459" style="s2">they maybe aren&#39;t aware of like yes you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.600" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">use technology and they own your data</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.459" end="00:09:20.420" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna get more powerful is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:21.380" style="s2">an actual problem that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.420" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">aware of but don&#39;t think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.380" end="00:09:26.600" style="s2">solution for and it&#39;s hard to market to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:29.029" style="s2">a solution that people don&#39;t know or</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.600" end="00:09:30.920" style="s2">don&#39;t really care about so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.029" end="00:09:33.170" style="s2">meeting them where they are figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.920" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">you know how that perhaps the message in</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.170" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">that way without crafting it too broadly</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:40.190" style="s2">because this is part of what I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:41.660" style="s2">with is like everyone needs to eat so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:43.399" style="s2">we started with a food app we could find</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.660" end="00:09:45.860" style="s2">possibly ten thousand people to it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.399" end="00:09:47.990" style="s2">you know more easily to work on it at</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.860" end="00:09:50.330" style="s2">the same time then we have ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.990" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">very diapers very like who all they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.330" end="00:09:53.570" style="s2">in common is that they want to eat</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">properly and so some people you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.570" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">like there it isn&#39;t there&#39;s a real like</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">the first project being and also</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">somewhat altruistic this is further my</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:04.700" style="s2">good but the good of humanity as well is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:07.970" style="s2">a good place to start on like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.700" end="00:10:10.610" style="s2">cafe or Yelper solutions or anything of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.970" end="00:10:11.570" style="s2">those or the meta projects that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.610" end="00:10:13.399" style="s2">see that these are people who already</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.570" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2">have a passion for something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.399" end="00:10:21.649" style="s2">doing for a greater purpose then how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">we actually help each other I don&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.649" end="00:10:24.890" style="s2">talking today about what that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.870" style="s2">look like tomorrow it&#39;s my brother who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.890" end="00:10:28.310" style="s2">doing the first one for elections</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.870" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no one seems to want to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.310" end="00:10:32.930" style="s2">they&#39;re like I&#39;ll watch the first one</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.660" end="00:10:35.959" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of a good transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.930" end="00:10:37.670" style="s2">because it was like our goal setting</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.959" end="00:10:39.430" style="s2">group and some having to focus on wiki</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.670" end="00:10:41.750" style="s2">elections to see what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.430" end="00:10:45.950" style="s2">what we were doing to what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.750" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">right it feels good and he&#39;s not getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.950" end="00:10:50.050" style="s2">biggie</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:52.670" style="s2">so he&#39;s we can practice Omega rule but</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.050" end="00:10:54.440" style="s2">he&#39;s not necessarily be requiring that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.670" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">if that makes sense like it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.440" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">good so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m good at SEO</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">make a rule with people&#39;s projects so</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:01.580" style="s2">like what about this piece that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">working and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.580" end="00:11:07.240" style="s2">how to do that in it will make a rural</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">way that is helpful instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.240" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">deterrent right that isn&#39;t putting</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">people off their budget is it like oh no</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">one leaves a mess but is helping it be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">stronger and more like I said before I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:20.300" style="s2">like it when people do that to my</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:21.860" style="s2">project so I do it to other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.300" end="00:11:23.810" style="s2">projects not realizing that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.860" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">themselves might not really like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.810" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">because they haven&#39;t sat for hours</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:29.180" style="s2">picking apart every hole in their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:30.740" style="s2">project they loved when someone else</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.100" end="00:13:39.399" style="s2">ideas and how we can govern the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.660" end="00:13:41.500" style="s2">right that was like a fractal Demong</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.399" end="00:13:42.820" style="s2">democracy in these things and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.500" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">like well we should I would you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:50.769" style="s2">everyone so obsessed about finding a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.850" end="00:13:52.510" style="s2">city or a country to try these things on</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.769" end="00:13:56.199" style="s2">instead of like a corporation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.510" end="00:13:58.540" style="s2">actually is that like it&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.199" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">that&#39;s safe enough to try and fail so</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">why not try our like having a mega mega</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:04.690" style="s2">I make a corporation that has little</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:07.510" style="s2">branches where they try these different</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.690" end="00:14:09.399" style="s2">forms right like trying different forms</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.510" end="00:14:11.380" style="s2">of communication different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.399" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">governments does this work doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.380" end="00:14:15.610" style="s2">work like I can only imagine sitting</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">down with fractal democracy I really</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.610" end="00:14:19.660" style="s2">like the idea but I wouldn&#39;t want to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.550" style="s2">it implemented across my country it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.660" end="00:14:24.279" style="s2">could be a disaster and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.550" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">pros I can see even on paper the dough</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.279" end="00:14:30.269" style="s2">aren&#39;t fixed by this in any more than</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:34.740" style="s2">they are in first pass suppose so having</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.269" end="00:14:39.579" style="s2">something was like a a musical note oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.740" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s right um sitting down and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.579" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">having that I was listening to or</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:44.350" style="s2">reading a Wikipedia article and all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:47.589" style="s2">different types of communication that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.350" end="00:14:49.089" style="s2">are like the World Cafe and trying those</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.589" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">and see which ones are effective for</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.089" end="00:14:53.260" style="s2">what types of conversation if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:55.329" style="s2">fish full method which I think would</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.260" end="00:14:56.920" style="s2">work really well because it&#39;s like five</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.329" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">four to five people sit in the center</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.920" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">and have a conversation and people come</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:02.110" style="s2">and kind of talk people on the shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:03.430" style="s2">and they remove or they come and sit in</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.110" end="00:15:04.899" style="s2">the sea and then someone vacates a seat</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.430" end="00:15:06.190" style="s2">so you only ever have four to five</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.899" end="00:15:08.529" style="s2">people who are talking but you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.190" end="00:15:09.880" style="s2">much broader audience watching and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.529" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">is something we could actually try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.880" end="00:15:15.639" style="s2">meet with a stream yard because of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:17.290" style="s2">it works the issue is the rep like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.639" end="00:15:18.490" style="s2">especially with online the repetition</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.290" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">right there&#39;s like as soon as I want top</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.490" end="00:15:22.360" style="s2">so know that like how rapid isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">someone cut like you have to be seeds I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.360" end="00:15:25.269" style="s2">think you have to be sitting there for</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:28.149" style="s2">at least 10-15 minutes before the next</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.269" end="00:15:30.490" style="s2">person we kind of tap you out</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.149" end="00:15:34.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just way too rapid and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.490" end="00:15:35.379" style="s2">any but there&#39;s um there has that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.119" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">create technology that it makes an</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.379" end="00:15:39.879" style="s2">effective communication tool for</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:41.259" style="s2">everyone to be heard for the best idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.879" end="00:15:42.819" style="s2">is to get to the top which is not I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.259" end="00:15:44.529" style="s2">don&#39;t think fractal democracy does that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.819" end="00:15:46.809" style="s2">because you have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.529" end="00:15:49.779" style="s2">seven people but if you are like tier</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.809" end="00:15:52.269" style="s2">five the idea is like there were all in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.779" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">teams of seven right so like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.269" end="00:15:55.929" style="s2">seven at the fifth level if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:58.110" style="s2">representative for that level you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.929" end="00:16:01.449" style="s2">representing five to the power of seven</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.110" end="00:16:03.220" style="s2">know the power five or something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.449" end="00:16:05.649" style="s2">seven to power vodkas it&#39;s seven for</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.220" end="00:16:07.300" style="s2">each level and but are you because</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.649" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">you&#39;re only meeting with seven plus</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.300" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">seven plus seven like seven times five</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:12.579" style="s2">so like thirty five people and those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.990" end="00:16:14.470" style="s2">the only ones you know and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.579" end="00:16:17.050" style="s2">have nepotism towards them and not like</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.470" end="00:16:18.100" style="s2">it&#39;s just like are buy more whenever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.050" end="00:16:18.459" style="s2">not gonna have this conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.100" end="00:16:19.779" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.459" end="00:16:22.449" style="s2">it&#39;s just to have this conversation two</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.779" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">hours ago but there&#39;s like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.449" end="00:16:27.490" style="s2">play and try different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:28.869" style="s2">governments without like how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.490" end="00:16:31.300" style="s2">a convert if there&#39;s four of us how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.869" end="00:16:33.429" style="s2">we have a conversation that isn&#39;t one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.300" end="00:16:37.480" style="s2">us leading it right that isn&#39;t will let</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.429" end="00:16:39.429" style="s2">us run this by the believer right there</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.480" end="00:16:42.939" style="s2">is no leader it&#39;s like how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.429" end="00:16:44.709" style="s2">our ideas to a group and how the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.939" end="00:16:46.600" style="s2">ideas move forward and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.709" end="00:16:48.910" style="s2">improve them together right without me</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.600" end="00:16:50.679" style="s2">needing it to be my idea are you needing</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">it to be your idea like but only and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.679" end="00:16:55.379" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to do that because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:55.379" style="s2">were us right like for human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:06.669" style="s2">hear that in here but I could just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.009" end="00:17:08.649" style="s2">little bit oh I guess someone hangs up</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.669" end="00:17:13.929" style="s2">on you don&#39;t keep coming back it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.649" end="00:17:15.939" style="s2">with my kid at the moment she has asleep</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.929" end="00:17:20.649" style="s2">over last night I&#39;m sitting I&#39;m here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.939" end="00:17:22.809" style="s2">interrupted but not interrupted in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.649" end="00:17:25.929" style="s2">thought because what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.809" end="00:17:27.399" style="s2">but finding like have even if people</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.929" end="00:17:28.539" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be involved involvement</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.399" end="00:17:30.789" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to gather tech to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.539" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">their project I do think people want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.789" end="00:17:34.840" style="s2">have a say in how governance works how</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:36.130" style="s2">communication works and just trying that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.840" end="00:17:40.780" style="s2">out that&#39;s why I think people do come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.130" end="00:17:42.100" style="s2">the idea cafes and such</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.780" end="00:17:43.570" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really know what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.100" end="00:17:45.040" style="s2">like a part of what I wanted to do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.570" end="00:17:48.040" style="s2">actually reach out to Jordan again and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.040" end="00:17:49.870" style="s2">have a conversation with him on like hey</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">run the game be group without admins</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.750" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">right not to like take over from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:03.490" style="s2">abandons but like what does a space look</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:05.530" style="s2">like without Authority with a needy and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.490" end="00:18:06.700" style="s2">there to be this central group of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.530" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">that you have to run like I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.700" end="00:18:11.140" style="s2">this person they should be kicked out</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:14.020" style="s2">like because there&#39;s a benefit and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.140" end="00:18:15.370" style="s2">cost right like whoa the person they</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.020" end="00:18:18.940" style="s2">want to be kicked up you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.370" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">necessarily blast them right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.940" end="00:18:21.850" style="s2">want to be like what here&#39;s why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.080" style="s2">like them well then do you not like them</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.850" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">enough for them to you kicked out anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.080" end="00:18:28.060" style="s2">like what is the actual process of doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:29.650" style="s2">that in a I&#39;ll make a rule away or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.060" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">like wait what is the metric you need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.650" end="00:18:32.890" style="s2">be to be part of this and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:34.600" style="s2">failing at it repeatedly and not owning</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.890" end="00:18:38.560" style="s2">your you know not groaning ohh moaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.600" end="00:18:40.210" style="s2">what is the state that you know you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.560" end="00:18:41.320" style="s2">have the conversations before those</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.210" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">things happen and to have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.320" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">conversation of like what game B is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:51.340" style="s2">800 to a thousand root person grew so</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">fractal democracy we could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.340" end="00:18:57.850" style="s2">using it right like we could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:19:00.010" style="s2">meeting in groups of four and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.850" end="00:19:01.930" style="s2">like like seeing like how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.010" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">this could go and then offering it to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.930" end="00:19:07.180" style="s2">the group and having people ordinate all</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:11.500" style="s2">that we can actually try things without</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.180" end="00:19:14.050" style="s2">needing them to be global or mega cuz we</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.500" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">can&#39;t like the the two of us can&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.050" end="00:19:16.510" style="s2">the world&#39;s problems of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want the problem solved right</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.510" end="00:19:20.680" style="s2">ourselves anyway unless people come on</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:22.690" style="s2">board and want to offer what they want</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.680" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">as solutions work together to create</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.690" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">them and so the more like we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">around and figuring out what how the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:32.170" style="s2">whole world should work and then making</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:34.330" style="s2">the whole world work that way doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.170" end="00:19:36.310" style="s2">work we need to include the world so</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.330" end="00:19:38.530" style="s2">having a conversation that is includes</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.310" end="00:19:39.910" style="s2">ten people and then that only is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.530" end="00:19:41.380" style="s2">solution maybe first ten but we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.910" end="00:19:43.270" style="s2">extrapolate and think about what it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.380" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">would look like for millions or tens of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.270" end="00:19:48.250" style="s2">millions of people but only ever making</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:50.679" style="s2">it kind of the size you are actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.250" end="00:19:52.630" style="s2">like not thinking I know what 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.679" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">people need there aren&#39;t 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.630" end="00:19:54.760" style="s2">Jubilees hanging out that all want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:56.890" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.760" end="00:20:01.570" style="s2">same thing there&#39;s only one of me thank</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.890" end="00:20:03.040" style="s2">God yeah what do you want this space to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.570" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">look like like does that sound like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.040" end="00:20:16.540" style="s2">resonates with you what I&#39;m what I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:19.270" style="s2">talking about yes I think that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.540" end="00:20:21.090" style="s2">together Tech and specific I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.270" end="00:20:23.950" style="s2">could cover quite a few topics there</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.090" end="00:20:26.049" style="s2">like for the game be space I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.950" end="00:20:29.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think we have it anywhere like</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.049" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">real decisions but it&#39;s funny you really</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.230" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">only need democracy when you have kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.090" style="s2">of a zero-sum game to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:39.309" style="s2">because if you limited resources and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.090" end="00:20:43.780" style="s2">don&#39;t there&#39;s nothing to decide as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.309" end="00:20:45.820" style="s2">group it&#39;s really more like you float</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.780" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">something up and people would join if</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.820" end="00:20:54.040" style="s2">they if they&#39;re passionate about it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:55.900" style="s2">there may not be as much of a need for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.040" end="00:20:57.549" style="s2">that like at the game be space right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.900" end="00:21:00.520" style="s2">unless we did want to like dissolve all</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.549" end="00:21:03.460" style="s2">the admins and that may be something if</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.520" end="00:21:04.809" style="s2">we had a path forward without that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.460" end="00:21:08.410" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s something you&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.809" end="00:21:10.270" style="s2">need a vote on and actually my you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.410" end="00:21:17.799" style="s2">my future projects is to eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.270" end="00:21:19.210" style="s2">voting in theory but it would you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.799" end="00:21:22.150" style="s2">there&#39;d still be a good reason to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.210" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">rank-choice voting or liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.150" end="00:21:27.070" style="s2">or fractal democracy and fractal</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:30.610" style="s2">democracy is very similar to what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.070" end="00:21:33.340" style="s2">were doing with the meetings</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.610" end="00:21:35.080" style="s2">it just wasn&#39;t regular regularly the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.340" end="00:21:36.460" style="s2">same people meeting and not almost they</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.080" end="00:21:39.220" style="s2">could be better if you didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:41.140" style="s2">same people meeting each time where it</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.220" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">was you know groups of four or seven</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.140" end="00:21:48.760" style="s2">meeting kind of randomly and then still</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:50.679" style="s2">having that way of you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.760" end="00:21:52.360" style="s2">fractal democracy one a person a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.679" end="00:21:58.809" style="s2">representative was the person that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.360" end="00:22:02.200" style="s2">that was aggregating all the data up so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.809" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">yeah those are all things to try and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.200" end="00:22:05.830" style="s2">think even even smaller than a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:07.780" style="s2">corporation although if two together</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.830" end="00:22:08.590" style="s2">texts there then it would be one but</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.780" end="00:22:10.210" style="s2">each project</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.590" end="00:22:13.510" style="s2">could be its own experiment with its</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.210" end="00:22:15.490" style="s2">governance form assuming there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.510" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">people to warrant some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.490" end="00:22:21.580" style="s2">governance but yeah also together tech</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:23.350" style="s2">being a place to experiment with those</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.580" end="00:22:25.929" style="s2">different ways and maybe that should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:28.179" style="s2">part of the together Tech Charter is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.929" end="00:22:30.900" style="s2">that every six months or a year we</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.179" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">change the the way that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.900" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">aggregates right to try different</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:37.150" style="s2">experiments because I still think having</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:40.690" style="s2">together tech being one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.150" end="00:22:43.720" style="s2">that we practice game B is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.690" end="00:22:46.779" style="s2">benefit yeah yeah I saw and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.720" end="00:22:48.100" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s just game B is already a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.779" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">population that&#39;s trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:52.179" style="s2">better world so there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">interactions run like this feels</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.179" end="00:22:55.059" style="s2">heretical to me even though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.409" end="00:22:57.309" style="s2">trying to be hired like where they put</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.059" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">out a principles and vision it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.309" end="00:23:00.549" style="s2">well wait what if you don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:02.049" style="s2">one of them what like why and I get why</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.549" end="00:23:05.649" style="s2">you need to have that but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.049" end="00:23:06.909" style="s2">time and Facebook is set up very much to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.649" end="00:23:09.250" style="s2">have it mittens you can&#39;t believe a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.909" end="00:23:11.169" style="s2">favorite group it means right but having</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.250" end="00:23:12.909" style="s2">the conversation of like what would this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.169" end="00:23:14.740" style="s2">look like not necessarily taking it away</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.909" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">just the conversation I want to have and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.740" end="00:23:18.070" style="s2">bravery we want to have that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:20.409" style="s2">conversation with together tech right I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.070" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">want to have the conversation with five</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.409" end="00:23:23.470" style="s2">people to say hey how do we run this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:24.820" style="s2">meeting that isn&#39;t immediate like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.470" end="00:23:26.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t does it look like a board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.820" end="00:23:29.380" style="s2">right like what makes this fun for us</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.440" end="00:23:30.940" style="s2">what makes this um effective right</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.380" end="00:23:34.870" style="s2">because part of what I struggle struggle</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.940" end="00:23:37.390" style="s2">with my ideas come to me when I&#39;m by</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.870" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">myself and generally started my kids and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.390" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">then I write them on a paper and then I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:42.100" style="s2">can&#39;t communicate them I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:43.390" style="s2">know necessarily besides I know how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.100" end="00:23:45.340" style="s2">have a conversation and whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.390" end="00:23:48.250" style="s2">off I could share it it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.340" end="00:23:49.809" style="s2">process than being in group and being</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.250" end="00:23:51.070" style="s2">individually but how do you those two</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.809" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">Mel looks there&#39;s tons of the I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.070" end="00:23:54.100" style="s2">most people couple ideas by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">then have to get people on board with it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.100" end="00:23:58.779" style="s2">and so like what does it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:00.340" style="s2">create something from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.779" end="00:24:01.659" style="s2">right this idea I have in my head on how</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.340" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">to fund it how to govern it how to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.659" end="00:24:06.549" style="s2">all of that it&#39;s just not mine it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:09.370" style="s2">ours right and the truth is is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.549" end="00:24:11.500" style="s2">seed it&#39;s not the plant and so creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.370" end="00:24:12.850" style="s2">something that is just like what is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.500" end="00:24:15.880" style="s2">word everything we would have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.850" end="00:24:17.409" style="s2">out to run a technology company um my</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.880" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">mind more goes to things like funding</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.409" end="00:24:21.309" style="s2">and marketing and governance because</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:22.629" style="s2">those are important things to figure out</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.149" end="00:24:48.730" style="s2">to allow for a culture of failure right</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:49.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re and that was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.730" end="00:24:51.519" style="s2">trying to talk about before with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:53.169" style="s2">project tour on some was like well what</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.519" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">if this goes bad bad you should like be</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.169" end="00:24:57.100" style="s2">picking which project when focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">and like how do you see this going bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.100" end="00:25:00.999" style="s2">like what&#39;s the most horrific thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.869" style="s2">could happen with us being on camera</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.999" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">right like I&#39;m so in this space at least</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.869" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">here like with this exact project of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:10.539" style="s2">getting it wrong I&#39;m like every new</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">thing seems like it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.539" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">gonna move it forward and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">explode if it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:16.840" style="s2">viral and there&#39;s gonna be you know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:20.499" style="s2">million people we need to help create a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.840" end="00:25:22.149" style="s2">better world and it&#39;s not about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.499" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about like playing in your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.149" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">space having what makes it fun for you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:31.990" style="s2">for me right and then creating it from</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.350" end="00:25:34.119" style="s2">there and owning like we&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.990" end="00:25:36.369" style="s2">this for a country where hopefully it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.119" end="00:25:38.409" style="s2">gonna become huge but it&#39;s so small</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.369" end="00:25:40.899" style="s2">right now that it is safe enough to fail</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.409" end="00:25:42.129" style="s2">and what does failure even look like if</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.899" end="00:25:43.539" style="s2">we&#39;re learning and growing and being</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.129" end="00:25:45.940" style="s2">transparent about it so that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.539" end="00:25:49.179" style="s2">iteration comes out you can see what</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.940" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">happens there&#39;s something very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.179" end="00:25:52.299" style="s2">there so what I was trying to say was</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:56.350" style="s2">that I want to have another conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.299" end="00:25:57.850" style="s2">with Jordan on ideas are not forgave me</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.350" end="00:25:59.289" style="s2">specifically but he knows about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.850" end="00:26:01.269" style="s2">technical operative and he&#39;s supportive</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.289" end="00:26:04.629" style="s2">of it he thinks it&#39;s a great idea to ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.269" end="00:26:06.340" style="s2">what he thinks this Friday think like or</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.629" end="00:26:07.690" style="s2">whenever we do it could look like like</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:09.940" style="s2">what do we need to talk about how do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.690" end="00:26:12.580" style="s2">govern a small group without it needing</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.940" end="00:26:14.379" style="s2">to be like without us deciding to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.580" end="00:26:18.039" style="s2">power over the population right like</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.379" end="00:26:19.480" style="s2">well if everyone 2x know you can and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.039" end="00:26:21.039" style="s2">can ask them what would get them to X</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.480" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">but we can&#39;t demand they ever get there</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.039" end="00:26:23.830" style="s2">we can&#39;t even demand people practice a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:25.480" style="s2">major rule right</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.830" end="00:26:27.009" style="s2">we can have something similar in our</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.480" end="00:26:29.889" style="s2">together tech but like when people</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.009" end="00:26:31.419" style="s2">aren&#39;t what do we then do like what</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.889" end="00:26:33.070" style="s2">conversations I just want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.419" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">conversation with him because I like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">having a conversation people end up</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:36.040" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">those videos more than they watch other</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.040" end="00:26:42.460" style="s2">ones I&#39;m wondering if he wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:45.730" style="s2">part of its no one okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.460" end="00:26:47.020" style="s2">freeway conversation I think that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.730" end="00:26:49.809" style="s2">be great</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.020" end="00:26:51.850" style="s2">if I&#39;m not able to be scheduled though I</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.809" end="00:26:53.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to hold it up but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.850" end="00:26:56.110" style="s2">would appreciate being there yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.860" end="00:26:58.150" style="s2">all right and then we can kind of share</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.110" end="00:26:59.650" style="s2">our vision and what whether it would and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.150" end="00:27:01.450" style="s2">it specifically for that so I would also</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.650" end="00:27:03.700" style="s2">probably need help propagate that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.450" end="00:27:07.900" style="s2">like kind of like a one page white page</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.700" end="00:27:09.970" style="s2">what it is we&#39;re looking to do to invite</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.900" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">meant be great if you could come on at</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.930" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">difference are they&#39;re actually not many</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.430" end="00:30:11.370" style="s2">types of conversations but the fishbowl</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:13.260" style="s2">one and there was one other one I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:14.460" style="s2">remember that where I was like oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.260" end="00:30:18.020" style="s2">see how these would be very powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.460" end="00:30:20.610" style="s2">different things like one is almost a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.020" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">almost a panel of experts right that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.610" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">people are watching and then as you feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:26.390" style="s2">you&#39;re the expert you can come sit in</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.120" end="00:30:28.770" style="s2">the middle so it is more I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.390" end="00:30:30.630" style="s2">introvert friendly to be you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.770" end="00:30:32.520" style="s2">have people watching and and those that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.630" end="00:30:33.930" style="s2">want to come and speak speak and then as</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.520" end="00:30:36.210" style="s2">part of its like that with breakout</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.930" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">groups and such and then with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.210" end="00:30:40.980" style="s2">cafe like having just as scheduling to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:42.930" style="s2">learn like we were talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.980" end="00:30:44.490" style="s2">helps you find the conversation in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.930" end="00:30:47.160" style="s2">piece and maybe there&#39;s three different</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.490" end="00:30:48.950" style="s2">types of conversations that were because</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.160" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">if the biggest part is the instant</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.950" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2">schedule in our scheduling right getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:56.340" style="s2">people in the same place at the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:30:57.870" style="s2">time rhymes are same time around there</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.340" end="00:30:59.809" style="s2">really it&#39;s come to think of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.870" end="00:31:01.009" style="s2">breakout room it&#39;s asynchronous pair</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.809" end="00:31:03.529" style="s2">breakout rooms right because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.009" end="00:31:06.259" style="s2">breakout rooms that happen not wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.529" end="00:31:09.739" style="s2">have everyone else together mmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.259" end="00:31:11.869" style="s2">it&#39;s off-off-off meeting breakout room</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.739" end="00:31:13.849" style="s2">sorta yeah and then from there how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.869" end="00:31:16.309" style="s2">you have an effective conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.849" end="00:31:18.019" style="s2">funnels up but that&#39;s not beta that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.309" end="00:31:20.139" style="s2">next right like the point in some</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.019" end="00:31:22.789" style="s2">conversations about that and say create</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.139" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">hopefully a beta tool that helps me</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.789" end="00:31:27.049" style="s2">facilitate that make that possible I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:28.969" style="s2">mean yeah I&#39;m part of enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.049" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">conversations I don&#39;t necessarily need</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.969" end="00:31:32.330" style="s2">this tool to facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">conversations I do to my life right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.330" end="00:31:36.429" style="s2">but I want everyone to have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:38.570" style="s2">experience I want everyone to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.429" end="00:31:40.669" style="s2">conversation so whatever is important to</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:54.919" style="s2">problems instead of solutions like what</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.999" end="00:31:57.830" style="s2">happens when there&#39;s a new I ran almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.919" end="00:31:59.570" style="s2">war and you know my friend who&#39;s from</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.320" style="s2">marching the street because I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.029" end="00:32:11.269" style="s2">anything to do anything for the Iraq war</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.320" end="00:32:13.239" style="s2">it&#39;s and you know it&#39;s maybe did</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.269" end="00:32:15.469" style="s2">something for the Vietnam War after</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.239" end="00:32:17.889" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of deaths ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.469" end="00:32:21.169" style="s2">thousands of deaths at least and</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.169" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">not effective what we&#39;re doing and so to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.879" end="00:32:27.259" style="s2">have a space to have a conversation even</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.849" style="s2">where it is just hey the president just</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.259" end="00:32:31.009" style="s2">tweeted something stupid I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.849" end="00:32:33.019" style="s2">about it I want to have like not have</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.009" end="00:32:35.779" style="s2">this pettiness on me and be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.019" end="00:32:38.749" style="s2">hey how does this which is almost what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.779" end="00:32:41.239" style="s2">wanted to do over the fractal democracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.749" end="00:32:44.029" style="s2">was it how do we create a country like</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.239" end="00:32:46.460" style="s2">that but how do we create technology</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.029" end="00:32:48.019" style="s2">that utilizes that where when I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.460" end="00:32:49.609" style="s2">have a conversation I&#39;m set up with six</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.019" end="00:32:51.049" style="s2">people who also want to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.609" end="00:32:53.119" style="s2">and we can have a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.049" end="00:32:54.409" style="s2">brainstorm but we&#39;re not really gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.119" end="00:32:55.669" style="s2">able to find funding with seven people</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.409" end="00:32:56.690" style="s2">we&#39;re not really gonna be able to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.669" end="00:32:58.669" style="s2">know I mean that&#39;s more of a board of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.690" end="00:33:00.409" style="s2">directors and funny but if something</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.669" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">like the Iraq war like the Iran war</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.409" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s about to happen something like</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">the Australian fires climate change</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:07.970" style="s2">there isn&#39;t seven of us there&#39;s seventy</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:10.729" style="s2">million of us there&#39;s 7 million of us</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.970" end="00:33:11.420" style="s2">right yeah and then it puts you together</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.729" end="00:33:12.740" style="s2">with another</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.420" end="00:33:14.360" style="s2">some another group of seven and once</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.740" end="00:33:15.770" style="s2">you&#39;re at a certain level you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.360" end="00:33:17.210" style="s2">have a certain amount of money to put in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.770" end="00:33:19.250" style="s2">as people are saying I&#39;m putting in ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.210" end="00:33:20.890" style="s2">dollars a month right and saying these</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.250" end="00:33:23.810" style="s2">are the things I want to focus on and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.890" end="00:33:26.300" style="s2">how I was working at unwind talk did</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.810" end="00:33:27.500" style="s2">jasper about it was that like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.300" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">putting in ten dollars a month whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.500" end="00:33:32.570" style="s2">level you&#39;re at you keep 25% of it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">pass on 75% of it right so the second</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.570" end="00:33:36.740" style="s2">level has like you have 250 per person</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.450" end="00:33:38.930" style="s2">right that&#39;s if you&#39;re meeting a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.740" end="00:33:41.180" style="s2">you can get some some chips to eat right</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.930" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">like that&#39;s not but the idea is like</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.180" end="00:33:45.110" style="s2">once you get to a certain level you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">you have the money to fund a project you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.110" end="00:33:48.890" style="s2">know you have something to do because</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">you&#39;re at you know the text here would</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.890" end="00:33:52.010" style="s2">be everyone in the world but it like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:53.150" style="s2">fifth sixth tier you have tens of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.010" end="00:33:55.480" style="s2">thousands hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.150" end="00:33:57.800" style="s2">dollars to work on something together</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:33:59.480" style="s2">and you&#39;re going on that you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.800" end="00:34:00.680" style="s2">where are we actually spending the money</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.480" end="00:34:02.120" style="s2">you can spend your twenty five percent</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.680" end="00:34:03.950" style="s2">all day every day you don&#39;t need to run</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.120" end="00:34:05.330" style="s2">that by the group but the group the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:07.310" style="s2">level it&#39;s at you have to run it by</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.330" end="00:34:10.100" style="s2">right so it has to not be content not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.310" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">hundred percent of people but do fifty</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.100" end="00:34:13.070" style="s2">one percent of people want to support</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:15.100" style="s2">this project versus this project and if</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.070" end="00:34:18.260" style="s2">it&#39;s 50 50 maybe you split the funds</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.100" end="00:34:19.850" style="s2">right like it was I&#39;m not suggesting we</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.260" end="00:34:20.300" style="s2">pivot and go that way just that it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.850" end="00:34:22.610" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.300" end="00:34:24.890" style="s2">that&#39;s an idea have you heard of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.610" end="00:34:28.490" style="s2">logarithmic funding I think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.890" end="00:34:30.710" style="s2">a logarithmic no but it&#39;s out anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.490" end="00:34:32.630" style="s2">one of the ideas is that one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.710" end="00:34:33.890" style="s2">you can choose where your government</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.630" end="00:34:37.100" style="s2">would spend your money but it could</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.890" end="00:34:39.590" style="s2">apply to gather tech is that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.100" end="00:34:44.030" style="s2">would donate their own money but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.590" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">government would contribute do matching</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.030" end="00:34:48.080" style="s2">contributions but they would actually do</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:50.030" style="s2">it logarithmically so that if two people</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.080" end="00:34:52.850" style="s2">donated a dollar they would do like four</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.030" end="00:34:54.679" style="s2">then so it was and they&#39;ve run kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.850" end="00:34:59.000" style="s2">studies and analysis on that and show</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.679" end="00:35:00.920" style="s2">that most of the time because of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.000" end="00:35:03.260" style="s2">incentive to give more money most</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.920" end="00:35:05.750" style="s2">projects get completely funded by</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.260" end="00:35:07.070" style="s2">donations because people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.750" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">anticipating the government to help out</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.070" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">but in the end the government for most</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:13.400" style="s2">projects doesn&#39;t need to help out just</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:16.750" style="s2">having that incentive helps people feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.400" end="00:35:18.770" style="s2">like their donations are going to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.750" end="00:35:19.940" style="s2">Kickstarter type thing that&#39;s backed by</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.770" end="00:35:23.120" style="s2">the government so I would say we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.940" end="00:35:24.770" style="s2">$100,000 to make this if it happens that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.120" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">we get 10,000 people who can attend all</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.770" end="00:35:28.310" style="s2">we don&#39;t need the government but if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">get but we will get one person the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.310" end="00:35:31.460" style="s2">government&#39;s on findings is knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">interest but it&#39;s that it there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.460" end="00:35:34.490" style="s2">an in-between stage of like enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.250" style="s2">people are interested there</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.490" end="00:35:38.930" style="s2">logarithmically funding it what they</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:41.330" style="s2">don&#39;t like so it&#39;s not like if we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.930" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">make a thousand dollars collectively we</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.330" end="00:35:46.310" style="s2">also get a million dollars from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:47.480" style="s2">government yeah probably not but it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.310" end="00:35:49.100" style="s2">interesting when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.480" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">that you had like a certain amount or</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.100" end="00:35:52.970" style="s2">that ten dollars where you&#39;re designated</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:55.430" style="s2">where the funds go you know maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.970" end="00:35:58.280" style="s2">that&#39;s where that other the other eight</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.430" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">or ten you know up to make the ten there</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.280" end="00:36:03.980" style="s2">might be some something in there to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.020" end="00:36:05.390" style="s2">learn together but yeah absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.980" end="00:36:07.460" style="s2">mean there&#39;s part of me there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.390" end="00:36:08.900" style="s2">I didn&#39;t pursue that in my own head in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.460" end="00:36:11.210" style="s2">my own mind in my fantasy world of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.900" end="00:36:12.860" style="s2">having it people put money towards a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.210" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">specific project they wanted one that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.860" end="00:36:16.820" style="s2">Kickstarter except but if we all</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.940" style="s2">commonly own it there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.820" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">with the issue was a lot of niche</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.940" end="00:36:23.840" style="s2">projects that are world life-changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:25.820" style="s2">for a small group if people wouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.840" end="00:36:27.950" style="s2">funded having a way that you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.820" end="00:36:29.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain pool of money and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.950" end="00:36:31.730" style="s2">we can vote on how important things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.660" end="00:36:33.080" style="s2">so like I know I wouldn&#39;t use that but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.730" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">can see how important it is for the deaf</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.080" end="00:36:38.270" style="s2">population right so like if we need what</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.800" style="s2">percentage is the deaf population right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.270" end="00:36:42.080" style="s2">well they&#39;re probably never going to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.800" end="00:36:43.160" style="s2">together to fund that level of thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.080" end="00:36:45.470" style="s2">because they&#39;re also going to care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.160" end="00:36:47.600" style="s2">every other project but making sure the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.470" end="00:36:50.090" style="s2">bad that they that if you&#39;re a large</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.600" end="00:36:51.830" style="s2">enough niche group you have X amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.090" end="00:36:53.750" style="s2">funding to make sure that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.830" end="00:36:55.400" style="s2">fact going to get something out of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.750" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">right that you&#39;re going to get a project</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.400" end="00:37:01.220" style="s2">that is important to you guys and how do</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">we utilize that project in or sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.220" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">I&#39;m like the deaf community for instance</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:06.260" style="s2">they can cover the project that helps</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:10.430" style="s2">all the projects work for them right</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.260" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">like hey let&#39;s have live subtitles right</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.430" end="00:37:14.930" style="s2">like that actually work I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:16.850" style="s2">they would do that but like not kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.930" end="00:37:18.980" style="s2">thing right think that&#39;s worth millions</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.850" end="00:37:20.330" style="s2">and millions of dollars and it would</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.980" end="00:37:22.550" style="s2">help not just the deaf community with</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.330" end="00:37:23.780" style="s2">them and if every every community you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.550" end="00:37:25.730" style="s2">know speak English you speak any other</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.780" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">language you know you are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:31.670" style="s2">helps a lot of people um I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:32.990" style="s2">sidetracked but that then the niche part</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.670" end="00:37:36.770" style="s2">of it right that it was like well then</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.990" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">how do we fund that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.770" end="00:37:40.730" style="s2">I also don&#39;t know like in fractal</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:42.950" style="s2">democracy it&#39;s one things as just</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.730" end="00:37:44.600" style="s2">about is like let&#39;s say we were having</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.950" end="00:37:46.100" style="s2">it with extinction rebellion right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.600" end="00:37:48.140" style="s2">people were like talking groups of seven</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.100" end="00:37:50.300" style="s2">and they got to five tiers so we have I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.140" end="00:37:53.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t do a million dollars to spend on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.300" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">a part of project extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.240" end="00:37:55.430" style="s2">definitely has more than a million</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:37:56.780" style="s2">dollars they have enough people</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.430" end="00:37:59.660" style="s2">contributing to them they definitely</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.780" end="00:38:00.920" style="s2">have tons of money they&#39;re spending it</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.660" end="00:38:02.150" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s like right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.920" end="00:38:04.630" style="s2">putting ads on Facebook you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.150" end="00:38:06.410" style="s2">mean like they&#39;re doing the old style</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.630" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">we&#39;re going out of the street for</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.410" end="00:38:10.580" style="s2">marching we&#39;re disrupting traffic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:12.170" style="s2">doing these things which they think is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.580" end="00:38:13.790" style="s2">offensive right they think it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.170" end="00:38:16.010" style="s2">option they have right now maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.790" end="00:38:18.860" style="s2">and that might be the option that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.010" end="00:38:20.420" style="s2">up with in 90% of the seven people</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.860" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">groups right like oh we marched in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.420" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">street and we spend our money this way</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:27.380" style="s2">how do we get filtered up the one in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:30.080" style="s2">hundred groups that&#39;s like or we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.380" end="00:38:32.270" style="s2">just solve it right like or we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.080" end="00:38:34.610" style="s2">just there might be more interaction</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.270" end="00:38:36.440" style="s2">right and use those millions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.610" end="00:38:38.090" style="s2">to actually talk to some people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.440" end="00:38:40.100" style="s2">don&#39;t think climate change is real to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.090" end="00:38:41.750" style="s2">actually recreate the supply chain right</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.100" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">to understand where is carbon and where</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.750" end="00:38:45.320" style="s2">is it going what projects do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.480" style="s2">understand this in what projects do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.320" end="00:38:49.609" style="s2">want to have more of an effective role</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.480" end="00:38:51.710" style="s2">as the voters as the consumers as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.609" end="00:38:54.310" style="s2">workers that are actually effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.710" end="00:38:58.010" style="s2">right that aren&#39;t this like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.310" end="00:38:58.310" style="s2">vote those ideas that are outside the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.010" end="00:38:59.990" style="s2">box</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.310" end="00:39:01.850" style="s2">even if they&#39;re ludicrous right like</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.990" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">even if it&#39;s like time travel you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.850" end="00:39:04.609" style="s2">like well maybe like anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.230" style="s2">ludicrous maybe gets a little more</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.609" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">attention so that we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.230" end="00:39:10.460" style="s2">conversation about it see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:13.850" style="s2">merit here and then you know NAB and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.460" end="00:39:15.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the status quo that gets</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.850" end="00:39:20.990" style="s2">moved forward because it&#39;s what most</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.020" end="00:39:23.510" style="s2">people think about right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.990" end="00:39:25.100" style="s2">one of the benefits of the recent score</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.510" end="00:39:29.600" style="s2">project I&#39;m working on since everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.100" end="00:39:31.880" style="s2">is reason based so if you want something</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.600" end="00:39:33.109" style="s2">instead of voting if you want something</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.880" end="00:39:35.810" style="s2">to rank higher</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.109" end="00:39:37.550" style="s2">you put a reason for it and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.810" end="00:39:41.930" style="s2">think it should be put a reason against</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.550" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">it that those little ideas can quickly</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.930" end="00:39:46.700" style="s2">rise to the top and if something if</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:49.220" style="s2">someone puts in an idea until someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.700" end="00:39:50.819" style="s2">thinks of a reason not to do it it ranks</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.220" end="00:39:52.529" style="s2">pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.819" end="00:39:56.549" style="s2">so one of the great thing about that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.529" end="00:40:00.059" style="s2">that it does surface those radical ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.549" end="00:40:01.380" style="s2">I love that the audience it&#39;s like I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.059" end="00:40:03.180" style="s2">pick a hole in anything and I can also</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.380" end="00:40:05.700" style="s2">give you written work and those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.180" end="00:40:07.380" style="s2">important things to not do not just not</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.700" end="00:40:09.479" style="s2">really do it anyone at service you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.380" end="00:40:11.700" style="s2">to know what could go wrong no we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.479" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">saying frak the democracy couldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.700" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">is it probably gonna work cuz of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:17.069" style="s2">nepotism I don&#39;t mean don&#39;t try it right</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.749" style="s2">I mean like how do we fix nepotism like</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.069" end="00:40:20.579" style="s2">how do you how do I make sure I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.749" end="00:40:22.979" style="s2">looking out for my six buddies that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.579" end="00:40:25.049" style="s2">representing that I meet with every week</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.979" end="00:40:26.579" style="s2">over the layers that are actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.049" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">supposed to represent even more of right</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.579" end="00:40:30.210" style="s2">so Mike how do we how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:31.890" style="s2">account for those things and I like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.210" end="00:40:34.019" style="s2">because also people are buried with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.890" end="00:40:35.579" style="s2">idea especially like it couldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.019" end="00:40:37.589" style="s2">like have you heard it do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.579" end="00:40:41.039" style="s2">what because no one&#39;s done it</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.039" end="00:40:44.009" style="s2">this and at the same time they were like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.269" end="00:40:46.200" style="s2">solution if you come from a little girl</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.009" end="00:40:48.509" style="s2">in Peru I&#39;m like you&#39;re gonna listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.200" end="00:40:51.239" style="s2">a little girl in Peru it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.509" end="00:40:52.589" style="s2">happen so yeah she probably does know</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.239" end="00:40:53.940" style="s2">and you&#39;re not gonna listen because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.589" end="00:40:55.259" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s like you could come from</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.940" end="00:40:58.349" style="s2">anyone but we&#39;re not gonna listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.259" end="00:41:00.930" style="s2">anyone and we do we need to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.349" end="00:41:03.299" style="s2">everyone and not in a way that their</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.930" end="00:41:06.029" style="s2">voice is amplified with stupid ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.299" end="00:41:07.469" style="s2">like to be able to say this isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.029" end="00:41:10.109" style="s2">have a reason not so that was the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.469" end="00:41:13.499" style="s2">with the Alpha a rally point that there</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.109" end="00:41:15.089" style="s2">that I still couldn&#39;t find there where</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.499" end="00:41:18.119" style="s2">it was like if you can prove it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.089" end="00:41:19.289" style="s2">prove it but if you are just like kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.119" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">of on it and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.289" end="00:41:21.479" style="s2">another solution</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:23.039" style="s2">like I said better than what we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.479" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">which is also everyone&#39;s like well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.039" end="00:41:30.479" style="s2">not perfect we can&#39;t implement that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:38.249" style="s2">but it&#39;s perfect and we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.479" end="00:41:41.729" style="s2">improving it so let&#39;s yes yes so I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.249" end="00:41:45.989" style="s2">a couple of phrases here to run past you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.729" end="00:41:51.089" style="s2">as far as describing together tech hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.989" end="00:41:54.239" style="s2">so I was thinking first off just a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.089" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">community people still work crafting</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.239" end="00:41:58.890" style="s2">this course computer people a community</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:02.700" style="s2">of people requesting and using software</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.890" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">for everyone as I don&#39;t like the word</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.700" end="00:42:06.040" style="s2">requesting but</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:08.020" style="s2">thing of designing is that people think</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.040" end="00:42:10.060" style="s2">of like professional designers we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.020" end="00:42:14.520" style="s2">to make sure that everyone feels like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.060" end="00:42:14.520" style="s2">they&#39;re contributing to the requirements</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.910" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">if there&#39;s a way to get the air horde</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.230" end="00:42:21.609" style="s2">everybody in there again earlier anyways</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:24.849" style="s2">and then like just community driven apps</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.609" end="00:42:26.680" style="s2">and something like a call to action that</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.849" end="00:42:29.230" style="s2">says join us tell us what apps would</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.680" end="00:42:35.050" style="s2">make you happy or give you life</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.230" end="00:42:39.700" style="s2">satisfaction or whatever they think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.050" end="00:42:41.230" style="s2">is I like the the the idea behind the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.700" end="00:42:42.849" style="s2">first one the community of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.230" end="00:42:45.369" style="s2">requesting and using software for</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.849" end="00:42:47.260" style="s2">everyone um but I don&#39;t think it makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.369" end="00:42:48.910" style="s2">sense to other people I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.260" end="00:42:50.410" style="s2">understood like what you said right they</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.910" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know that one it&#39;s non tech people</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.410" end="00:42:53.380" style="s2">like literally anyone can come to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:56.710" style="s2">part of this are you a human</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.380" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">do you like technology come to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.710" end="00:43:00.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like we specifically don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:04.030" style="s2">need the tech people because we can all</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.670" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">heart and it&#39;s like what do you want in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.030" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2">it and and we cannot exactly hire them</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:12.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s like that is what tech people</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.050" end="00:43:15.970" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily like I don&#39;t feel I</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:17.830" style="s2">need to make a make people&#39;s tech jobs</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.970" end="00:43:19.390" style="s2">better right like like in this anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.830" end="00:43:20.950" style="s2">feel I need to make agricultural workers</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.390" end="00:43:22.930" style="s2">better that kind of thing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.950" end="00:43:26.710" style="s2">there&#39;s enough people out there and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.930" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">have an amazing enough project if people</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.710" end="00:43:30.820" style="s2">will work on it for the standard wage</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:31.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll pick us first</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.820" end="00:43:34.119" style="s2">right like especially they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.960" end="00:43:35.710" style="s2">paid and it&#39;s not on contingency right</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.119" end="00:43:37.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not home when we make money I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.710" end="00:43:40.450" style="s2">make millions of dollars no you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.420" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this is this is when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.450" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">make it our planet exists and humanity</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.050" style="s2">gets better and better and so at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.300" style="s2">same time if someone&#39;s putting their</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.050" end="00:43:52.690" style="s2">life&#39;s blood into it or you know a year</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.300" end="00:43:54.520" style="s2">or codeine they get paid they get actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.690" end="00:43:57.700" style="s2">money for it because it&#39;s not a one hour</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.520" end="00:43:59.260" style="s2">a week conversation that don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.700" end="00:44:01.390" style="s2">get paid for it&#39;s amazing but I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.260" end="00:44:03.700" style="s2">also like to get paid eventually right</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.390" end="00:44:06.940" style="s2">like all of that at the same time but</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.700" end="00:44:08.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not the money that comes in goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.940" end="00:44:09.970" style="s2">to creating a project that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.650" end="00:44:12.339" style="s2">needed and people are putting their</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.970" end="00:44:16.690" style="s2">hours of time ins and skills to work or</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.339" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">so then to the board of directors that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.690" end="00:44:22.990" style="s2">our offering the vision but not that not</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">doing the physical labor of codeine and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.990" end="00:44:28.280" style="s2">making it look pretty in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:31.190" style="s2">brainstorming piece we also probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.280" end="00:44:32.840" style="s2">need NIM in person in person that can</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.190" end="00:44:34.310" style="s2">coordinate having conversations with all</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.840" end="00:44:37.160" style="s2">of the people in our new language is</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.310" end="00:44:39.770" style="s2">gonna bring him yeah that&#39;ll probably be</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.160" end="00:44:46.580" style="s2">one of the first either and slash</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.770" end="00:44:50.290" style="s2">community one or both yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.580" end="00:44:50.290" style="s2">reordered on community driven apps</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.230" end="00:44:58.220" style="s2">community of people requesting apps for</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:00.920" style="s2">everyone that yeah that might still like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.220" end="00:45:03.740" style="s2">be there like the later kind of</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:43.340" style="s2">implies us can be us together but</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.030" end="00:46:46.390" style="s2">usually when you&#39;re saying it still</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.340" end="00:46:54.850" style="s2">sounds like they&#39;re not the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.390" end="00:46:54.850" style="s2">joined to trying to tell us join to I</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.770" end="00:47:00.620" style="s2">collaborate I just want to use all my</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.580" end="00:47:06.280" style="s2">same old language join to collaborate on</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.180" end="00:47:36.170" style="s2">that a little bit more than this is not</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.740" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">for this exact thing but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.170" end="00:47:41.780" style="s2">craft it into the language there&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:43.100" style="s2">we are doing is non-hierarchical right</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.780" end="00:47:44.870" style="s2">like as much as we were gonna be a board</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.100" end="00:47:46.820" style="s2">is it we&#39;re gonna work we&#39;re gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.870" end="00:47:49.820" style="s2">on responsibility for creating things</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.820" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">for other people it&#39;s not on us right</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.820" end="00:47:52.820" style="s2">like if you see something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:54.530" style="s2">being done and we&#39;re not doing it your</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.820" end="00:47:56.150" style="s2">job isn&#39;t to tell us and make us do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.530" end="00:47:58.280" style="s2">your job is to do it yourself right your</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.150" end="00:48:00.890" style="s2">job is to help us craft how it gets done</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.280" end="00:48:03.020" style="s2">like to take ownership right that like</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.450" end="00:51:46.859" style="s2">conversation that was with you wanting</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.460" end="00:51:48.390" style="s2">to initiate a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.859" end="00:51:50.220" style="s2">yeah and asking if you wanted to be part</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.390" end="00:51:52.259" style="s2">of it if you wanted to be one of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.220" end="00:51:53.940" style="s2">conversations that I have with people or</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.259" end="00:51:56.700" style="s2">whether it was like a specific together</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.940" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">tech I think it also will let me stay</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.700" end="00:51:59.910" style="s2">focused if you&#39;re there as well to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:01.559" style="s2">like this is actually what we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.910" end="00:52:04.289" style="s2">and I like the idea of waiting until</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.559" end="00:52:06.599" style="s2">there&#39;s been a couple of project raising</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.289" end="00:52:08.549" style="s2">sessions they say hey this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.599" end="00:52:11.849" style="s2">doing right and like we maybe I was like</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.549" end="00:52:14.849" style="s2">an act I wonder if that brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.849" end="00:52:18.509" style="s2">one would be really good that&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.849" end="00:52:20.900" style="s2">time to wait three weeks but that would</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.509" end="00:52:24.660" style="s2">be a good one to kind of link to them</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.900" end="00:52:26.759" style="s2">because it would show what it would give</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.660" end="00:52:27.569" style="s2">some seeds to that conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.759" end="00:52:30.119" style="s2">right because these are the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.569" end="00:52:32.519" style="s2">people are thinking of mm-hmm how would</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.119" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">you thank you everyone for that yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.519" end="00:52:41.999" style="s2">I see what you&#39;re saying I&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:47.039" style="s2">it might be good I mean who waited three</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.999" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">weeks for other things it&#39;s also yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.039" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">the other thing is those things always</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:53.039" style="s2">happened the day after this right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:54.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like even if we did it the Friday</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.039" end="00:52:55.859" style="s2">after that it&#39;s still like a whole week</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.569" end="00:52:58.859" style="s2">and then we have whatever the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.859" end="00:53:01.319" style="s2">option is after the idea is to like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.859" end="00:53:04.019" style="s2">the project raising will meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.319" end="00:53:05.430" style="s2">having a conversation about what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.430" end="00:53:08.549" style="s2">person in the hot seat we need another</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.019" end="00:53:09.820" style="s2">word for that but I don&#39;t hold to call</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.740" end="00:53:23.170" style="s2">be this something that works for one</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.730" end="00:53:24.520" style="s2">person doesn&#39;t work but once we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.170" end="00:53:26.050" style="s2">enough of those under our belt we can</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.850" end="00:55:26.200" style="s2">be at least ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.870" end="00:55:29.470" style="s2">to adopt it and it&#39;s very different we</p>
