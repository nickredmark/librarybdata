<p begin="00:00:06.210" end="00:00:12.259" style="s2">going to take a topic that I&#39;ve recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.690" end="00:00:16.460" style="s2">addressed in text on the post called</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.259" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">thinking and simulated thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.460" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">address it here in video and see what</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">the differences are so this topic has to</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">do with an effort to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">different ways that people go about</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">making sense of and responding to their</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:40.110" style="s2">environment and specifically a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">distinction between what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.110" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">properly thinking and something else</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.480" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">that seems to be quite prevalent in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">contemporary environment that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">calling simulated thinking and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">notion is first and foremost that inside</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:01.859" style="s2">the concept of thinking there is at</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">least one major distinction I&#39;m certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.859" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">they&#39;re more but there&#39;s there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">least one which is between an approach</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">to the environment that is tuned to an</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">adaptive to novelty I might think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">this as well in the post I call it</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">Explorer mode so here we are listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">closely observing closely very little</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">preconceived notions about what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re perceiving and in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">slowly and carefully in somewhat lightly</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">grasping things that are in fact not</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">well understood and endeavoring to come</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">to grips with them on their own terms so</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:50.060" style="s2">this is Explorer mode and then standing</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">in contrast to Explorer mode is what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.060" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">called a habit mode so in habit mode we</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">have some framework for making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">responding to our environment at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">example I used was after you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:08.450" style="s2">learned how to drive a car that have it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">a driving car so very quickly you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.450" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">take your previously</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">frame that has very crisp patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">it can recognize and very specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">responses that it can activate and so in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">habit mode our our job is to do a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">job at quickly recognizing predefined</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">patterns and then effectively executing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">scripts for predefined and practiced</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">responses and so these two modes are</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:46.830" style="s2">adaptive to different conditions when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:51.240" style="s2">find ourselves in a circumstance of high</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.830" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">novelty then explorer mode is the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.240" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">approach and we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">circumstances of low novelty then habit</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:04.380" style="s2">mode is a generally good approach okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">so one of the things that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.380" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">failed to do in the text was to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">hammer home the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">distinction between explore mode and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">habit mode is not the same thing as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">distinction between thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">simulated thinking there are different</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">levels of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">so both explore mode and habit mode are</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">properly part of thinking thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">involves the skillful and fluid</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2">application of these different tools in</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">different environments in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.750" end="00:03:38.610" style="s2">environments thinking sorry in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">environments explore mode is right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.610" end="00:03:42.180" style="s2">other environments haven&#39;t that is right</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">and oftentimes women I&#39;d actually did go</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.180" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">back and forth in the same environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:52.250" style="s2">this is all part of thinking simulated</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">thinking I&#39;m proposin happens when</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.250" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">something breaks down this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:04:02.070" style="s2">fluidly participate in both modes and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:05.030" style="s2">fact maybe even more precisely is when</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.070" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">habit mode there shows up as and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.030" end="00:04:11.520" style="s2">presents itself as thinking and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:14.070" style="s2">where it gets very dangerous where one</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.520" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">is simulated thinking the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.070" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">actually may believe you possibly quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:21.390" style="s2">earnestly that they are in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:23.610" style="s2">thinking when what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:25.139" style="s2">actually running some kind of script</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.610" end="00:04:28.229" style="s2">some kind of habit</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.139" end="00:04:29.729" style="s2">and of course oftentimes some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.229" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">script there was not necessarily even</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.729" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">theirs in the first place they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:41.490" style="s2">running a third-party script malware as</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:44.219" style="s2">it were and are largely foreclosed from</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.490" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">Explorer mode right so simulated</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.219" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">thinking is that kind of a thing is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">as simple as merely just habit mode</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:05:00.360" style="s2">versus Explorer mode okay so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">that point has some clarity now the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.360" end="00:05:04.229" style="s2">next thing to think about is why why</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">does this happen and what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.229" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">so one piece to to look at is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">simulated thinking mr. proficiently</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">outcompetes real thinking in certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:24.990" style="s2">kinds of environments in particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:27.330" style="s2">environments that are static over an</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.990" end="00:05:29.940" style="s2">usually long period of time say over a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.330" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">great moderation particularly when there</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.940" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">is some kind of capacity to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:40.770" style="s2">niche construction or the agency of some</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:44.669" style="s2">organism is able to maintain the stasis</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.770" end="00:05:49.289" style="s2">of the environment they&#39;re in with their</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.669" end="00:05:51.719" style="s2">own activity pushing back on the changes</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.289" end="00:05:52.979" style="s2">that are happening in the environment so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.719" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">what ends up happening is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.979" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">feedback loop one&#39;s own capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">maintain the long duration of some niche</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">for which a particular set of scripts</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:11.310" style="s2">were well adapted then makes the use of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:13.800" style="s2">scripts a effective strategy and the use</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.310" end="00:06:18.089" style="s2">of thinking a ineffective strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.800" end="00:06:22.889" style="s2">as a consequence it becomes not possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.089" end="00:06:25.949" style="s2">to begin to optimize for using scripts</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.889" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">and to begin to lose the fluid capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.949" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">to then use both explore mode and habit</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">mode and this begins to move you into</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:37.319" style="s2">simulated thinking however by itself I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.319" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">next piece is crucial is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:44.790" style="s2">recognized that particularly in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:48.200" style="s2">kind of a static and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.790" end="00:06:52.320" style="s2">artificially static environment um</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.200" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">simulated thinking wins and at edito</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.320" end="00:06:57.480" style="s2">basis certainly in the short-term versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.080" end="00:07:02.070" style="s2">actual thinking simulated thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.480" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">ability to leverage previously produced</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.070" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">scripts and to deploy them rapidly looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:13.340" style="s2">at first like winning these are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:18.420" style="s2">thinking which is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.340" end="00:07:20.340" style="s2">disoriented and slow and awkward and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.420" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">oftentimes like saying things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.340" end="00:07:24.690" style="s2">even necessarily make sense or using</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.810" end="00:07:27.950" style="s2">terms inappropriately it&#39;s it&#39;s clumsy</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.690" end="00:07:32.450" style="s2">and of course the longer a particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.950" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">intelligence has been in a increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.450" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">artificially static environment the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:40.230" style="s2">this is going to be the case and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">effectively if you&#39;re have you far</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.230" end="00:07:44.940" style="s2">forgotten how to do actual thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">everything around you has been teaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.940" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2">you to engage in simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.540" style="s2">the act of waking up and beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">think is you know gonna be a becoming</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.540" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">like a toddler learning how to walk and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:08:01.410" style="s2">so somebody who has been very well</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:03.030" style="s2">trained as a ballet dancer in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.410" end="00:08:07.080" style="s2">the fact that they may not have done a</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:46.170" style="s2">quite often fall into simulated thinking</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.440" end="00:09:40.529" style="s2">simply deploy this repertoire and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.089" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">habit where you practice it you practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.529" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">a little vigorously and under intense</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.899" end="00:09:56.190" style="s2">but I think we should be clear that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.370" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">primary utility is investing someone in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.190" end="00:10:03.209" style="s2">a social conversation and that is at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:05.070" style="s2">conducive to collaborative thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.209" end="00:10:06.930" style="s2">that what ends up happening is that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.070" end="00:10:09.720" style="s2">someone shows up who&#39;s actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.930" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">to engage in collaborative thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.720" end="00:10:18.680" style="s2">someone else deploys the toolkit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:21.149" style="s2">debate the debater will show up as</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.680" end="00:10:24.660" style="s2">winning at least to those who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.149" end="00:10:27.990" style="s2">watching closely and the thinker will</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.660" end="00:10:30.779" style="s2">show up as being oftentimes really</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.990" end="00:10:32.459" style="s2">rather stupid and so you mean nobody</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.779" end="00:10:33.899" style="s2">wants to emulate that and so what is up</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.459" end="00:10:35.430" style="s2">happening is that it begins to select</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.899" end="00:10:36.750" style="s2">against thinking in both directions</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.430" end="00:10:38.760" style="s2">which is to say people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.750" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">think lose and other people don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.760" end="00:10:45.029" style="s2">try because it just looks like a bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.260" end="00:10:46.680" style="s2">choice and this shows up all over the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.029" end="00:10:49.199" style="s2">place you know the political infighting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.680" end="00:10:50.699" style="s2">is of this sort think about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.199" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">like in an academic department where you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.699" end="00:10:54.829" style="s2">have a distinction between a an earnest</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:56.760" style="s2">and perhaps somewhat unsophisticated</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.870" end="00:11:28.660" style="s2">same sort and the point is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.330" end="00:11:30.120" style="s2">a condition under which we first begin</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:34.020" style="s2">to move into an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.120" end="00:11:38.410" style="s2">simulated thinking becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.020" end="00:11:39.970" style="s2">useful and developing skills in just</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.410" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">doing that becomes the way to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.970" end="00:11:44.620" style="s2">successful in your environment and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:46.839" style="s2">also becomes more more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.620" end="00:11:49.300" style="s2">extinguishing thinking you know removing</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.839" end="00:11:52.270" style="s2">it from the field of play and then this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.300" end="00:11:54.670" style="s2">of course is a feedback loop the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.270" end="00:11:57.820" style="s2">structures that are able to do nice</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.670" end="00:11:59.529" style="s2">construction become controlled by those</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.820" end="00:12:01.300" style="s2">who are engaging in simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.529" end="00:12:02.529" style="s2">who then use to the structures to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.300" end="00:12:03.550" style="s2">maintain the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.529" end="00:12:07.570" style="s2">environment for which they are well</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.550" end="00:12:10.420" style="s2">adapted and as a consequence become even</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.570" end="00:12:12.279" style="s2">more well-positioned to extinguish</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:13.779" style="s2">thinking and to optimize for submitted</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.279" end="00:12:18.060" style="s2">thinking and you find yourself stuck</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.779" end="00:12:20.589" style="s2">you&#39;re not trapped in a particular niche</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.060" end="00:12:22.630" style="s2">and this will last until it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.589" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">because at the end of the day reality is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.630" end="00:12:28.900" style="s2">at ultimate Lea changing and so even a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">very powerful control structures ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.900" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">to hold back the waters will all be</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.930" end="00:12:41.400" style="s2">and there will be a flood of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.730" end="00:12:45.580" style="s2">that flows into the niche and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.400" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">intriguingly enough it generally works</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.580" end="00:12:52.839" style="s2">in such a way that the the more that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:57.130" style="s2">niche was constructed the the more that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.839" end="00:13:01.000" style="s2">moderation was imposed by agency the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.130" end="00:13:03.070" style="s2">more novelty will rush in and this is a</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.070" end="00:13:07.750" style="s2">like the relationship between the</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.050" end="00:13:18.999" style="s2">so this is where we find ourselves now</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.429" end="00:13:27.129" style="s2">has actually been a significant</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:43.509" style="s2">the dam is now in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.629" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">breaking and novelty is in the process</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.509" end="00:13:49.799" style="s2">of flooding and and of course now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:52.269" style="s2">happening is the Nisha is shifting we&#39;re</p>
