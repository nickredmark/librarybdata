<p begin="00:00:02.190" end="00:00:05.850" style="s2">part of our mini-series with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">psychedelic philosopher Peter just dead</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">age I do recommend listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:13.349" style="s2">first part but fill this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:15.480" style="s2">does stand on its own without that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.349" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">background but allow me just a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.480" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">minutes to introduce things in the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">part we covered some core aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">Peters approach to philosophy and thus</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">cast our psychedelic experience might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">brought to bear on such an approach we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">also discussed Bergson&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">duration one of those less common</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">concepts which i think is sensually</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">important to grapple with we now pick up</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">the conversation at the close of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">discussion about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">between psychedelic experience and death</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">Loosli the idea was something like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:49.410" style="s2">psychedelics perhaps offer an insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">into what it is to experience a state in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.410" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">which your ordinary sense of self is at</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:55.879" style="s2">least significantly diminished where</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">such a state might be speculatively</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.879" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">considered analogous to a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">and perhaps other than just metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">sense of death now this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">begins with my transitioning so the link</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">between this psychedelic state and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">mystical or religious experience but</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">moreover to the process which seems to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">characterize the journey to and from</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">such a domain the idea I lay out in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">opening is largely central to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">follows we touch on Nietzsche Bergson</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">sort of seems to be lending itself to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">talking about the kind of dissolution in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">a sense that the total fragmentation</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">understood as to be that which is fully</p>

<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">people often have this other rapturous</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">experience - after the death occurs they</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">are somehow more real than they&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:12.030" style="s2">been before and I don&#39;t know if I can</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.030" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">certainly held what I can only term a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.850" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">sort of communion with this source of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">divinity and it felt very much at the</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:30.299" style="s2">had gone to a place I I bore out a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.799" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">fragmentary relation very experienced in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.299" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">a very experientially real way to this</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:46.829" style="s2">became totally one with it I it was it</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.829" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">of arriving at it I realized that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.120" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">the next movement then was to was to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">return it was to return back as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">happened to the group dynamic that I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">a part of there were other people around</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:02.380" style="s2">me at the time and there were all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.380" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">you know not disputes exactly going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">there but all people at various</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">different stages in life and in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:14.500" style="s2">journey of the night and doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:16.840" style="s2">they were and and it seemed like part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.500" end="00:04:20.860" style="s2">the role then became one of attempting</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.840" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2">to find harmony again with the group so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.860" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">I mention this idea to you before as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:26.980" style="s2">well and that and that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:29.970" style="s2">this idea that grips me is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.980" end="00:04:32.860" style="s2">life itself to the extent that it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">vital and living and updating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.860" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">respond responding appropriately to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:40.690" style="s2">anomaly and not over fixing itself it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">must participate in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.690" end="00:04:46.030" style="s2">harmonizing process that can interact</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:48.790" style="s2">with what is beyond it and then bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.030" end="00:04:52.600" style="s2">back what is beyond it to adapt itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.790" end="00:04:56.380" style="s2">but that it can never attain that final</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.600" end="00:04:58.390" style="s2">place of perfection or utopia because to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.380" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">do so lose its movement fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.390" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">and to bring it back to the Bergson if</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">you attain fixation you lose movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:07.090" style="s2">and so to the extent that we continue to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:08.980" style="s2">be for life and have it and have it be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.090" end="00:05:11.200" style="s2">on the cusp of what is real and moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.980" end="00:05:13.390" style="s2">the most we can aim for and what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.200" end="00:05:15.730" style="s2">should aim for ethically is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.390" end="00:05:17.920" style="s2">harmonization of the updating of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.730" end="00:05:19.990" style="s2">knowledge structures and not their final</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.920" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">resting place in the way that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.990" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">think of Schopenhauer more than books on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:24.910" style="s2">even because you name for him there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">this ultimate will which is at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.910" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">center of all things and fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:31.750" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing but in each individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:32.980" style="s2">it&#39;s differentiated as such this is why</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.750" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">he&#39;s known as pessimist ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.980" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">really because the will is a striving</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:41.140" style="s2">constant striving hmm for him to life</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:42.790" style="s2">for Nietzsche to power but for shop now</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.420" end="00:06:03.220" style="s2">well because ah because for shopping our</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:06.340" style="s2">music takes one or what you see art</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.220" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">takes one away from the will it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.800" end="00:06:19.879" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting I mean</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.430" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">a paper to be written here about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.110" end="00:07:21.710" style="s2">relationship between that thought and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:23.750" style="s2">psychedelics again because as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.710" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">probably know most often in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.750" end="00:07:28.159" style="s2">experience when one takes psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:29.780" style="s2">once sort of practical will subsides it</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.159" end="00:07:32.120" style="s2">goes away you know I mean it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.780" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">difficult to move one&#39;s body you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.120" end="00:07:35.419" style="s2">think you think for example yeah I need</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:37.310" style="s2">to need to move to that to chair over</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.419" end="00:07:39.409" style="s2">there to to get that tea or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.310" end="00:07:41.090" style="s2">like this but your body doesn&#39;t and says</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.409" end="00:07:42.710" style="s2">now you know it doesn&#39;t respond you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.090" end="00:07:44.419" style="s2">you will somehow and actually most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.710" end="00:07:45.710" style="s2">the case time you don&#39;t even K just</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.419" end="00:07:47.630" style="s2">think you want that tea for like your</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">aesthetic reasons right not is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.630" end="00:07:51.110" style="s2">thirsty or for caffeine or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:52.759" style="s2">here&#39;s the interesting thing so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.110" end="00:07:55.370" style="s2">like the real loss of practical will</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:07:57.409" style="s2">with psychedelics at the same time a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.370" end="00:08:00.020" style="s2">huge flourishing of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.409" end="00:08:02.029" style="s2">because suddenly consciousness is not in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.020" end="00:08:04.340" style="s2">the service of the practical will this</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.029" end="00:08:05.569" style="s2">is where ill again links to Bergson so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.340" end="00:08:06.949" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge flourishing of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.569" end="00:08:08.509" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.949" end="00:08:10.009" style="s2">experience and then it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.509" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">well certainly I&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.009" end="00:08:13.190" style="s2">experiences now and again of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.469" style="s2">forms of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.190" end="00:08:17.900" style="s2">you know like him even seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.469" end="00:08:19.669" style="s2">artificial so not just natural forms you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.900" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">know plants what not flowers but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.669" end="00:08:23.330" style="s2">you know spaceships yeah sounds crazy</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:25.669" style="s2">but I&#39;ve seen the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.330" end="00:08:27.740" style="s2">spaceship you know it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.669" end="00:08:28.249" style="s2">made by aliens whatever but it has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.740" end="00:08:30.589" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.249" end="00:08:32.329" style="s2">you know it&#39;s sort of surreal beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.589" end="00:08:34.189" style="s2">at one point it just boom it&#39;s suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.329" end="00:08:36.709" style="s2">that&#39;s perfection mm-hmm and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.189" end="00:08:38.029" style="s2">goes away again also from Whitehead I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.709" end="00:08:39.979" style="s2">don&#39;t really believe in the dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.029" end="00:08:41.719" style="s2">between Natan nature and the artificial</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.979" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">anyway because we are part of nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.719" end="00:08:46.279" style="s2">right and our cars and our pollution are</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.139" style="s2">thus part of nature as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.279" end="00:08:50.420" style="s2">like a bird&#39;s nest as part of nature so</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.139" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">once you sort of break down that organic</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.420" end="00:08:57.079" style="s2">inorganic dichotomy and you you really</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:08:59.300" style="s2">you know start to see reality in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.079" end="00:09:01.339" style="s2">of non conceptual way yes and you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.300" end="00:09:03.500" style="s2">appreciate the beauty in anything yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.339" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">not just a forest or a flower or whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.500" end="00:09:07.009" style="s2">so yeah interestingly can can</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:09.319" style="s2">psychedelics break down the will and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.009" end="00:09:11.689" style="s2">thus bring one to a tranquil state of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.319" end="00:09:13.009" style="s2">pure contemplation which is good for</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.689" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">shopping now cuz the will like I say</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.009" end="00:09:17.509" style="s2">only leads to despair ultimately in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:20.569" style="s2">whatever form I think yeah they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.509" end="00:09:22.550" style="s2">however at the same time you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.569" end="00:09:24.439" style="s2">will as they call it perhaps you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.550" end="00:09:25.790" style="s2">make that analogy with the ego as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.439" end="00:09:28.639" style="s2">with the will you know it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.790" end="00:09:30.709" style="s2">the same thing in Freud but the egos you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.639" end="00:09:33.050" style="s2">know we need it to have evolved to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.709" end="00:09:35.059" style="s2">complex organisms we are now we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.050" end="00:09:36.769" style="s2">each and will and self survival and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.059" end="00:09:37.879" style="s2">power and resources and whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.769" end="00:09:40.220" style="s2">know without it we would have got</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.879" end="00:09:42.680" style="s2">nowhere and without even now in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.220" end="00:09:45.170" style="s2">of future state if no-one had it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.680" end="00:09:48.309" style="s2">know that will there would be much less</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.170" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">if any competition for not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.309" end="00:09:52.670" style="s2">destructive competition but competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:54.860" style="s2">to attain your name Prater vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:09:57.019" style="s2">whatever or greater forms of art or</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.860" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">whatever you know just the stability of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.019" end="00:10:00.620" style="s2">a society with so many people requires</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:03.529" style="s2">and as the complexity of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.620" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">requires a sort of um pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.529" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">afforded by the ego pragmatism you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:09.589" style="s2">exactly and and you know the great works</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.449" style="s2">of art would not have been possible were</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.589" end="00:10:13.339" style="s2">not for the will which you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.449" end="00:10:15.559" style="s2">believe it you know informed evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.339" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">and thus you know within one organism</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.559" end="00:10:18.379" style="s2">you know the development of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:19.759" style="s2">artistic talent which probably there</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.379" end="00:10:21.470" style="s2">from the beginning but won&#39;t develop so</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.759" end="00:10:23.930" style="s2">you know so in order to get oneself out</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.470" end="00:10:26.029" style="s2">of the will will is sort of precondition</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.930" end="00:10:28.129" style="s2">interestingly yeah this is interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.029" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">don&#39;t often think about so we have on</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.129" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">the one hand will here and what are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:33.769" style="s2">Jacque supposing that with in this case</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">the sort of a aesthetic possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.769" end="00:10:38.509" style="s2">consciousness well job now calls it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.829" style="s2">something like willis contemplation you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.509" end="00:10:42.019" style="s2">know ascetic contemplation which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.829" end="00:10:44.089" style="s2">willis if you accept shopping now which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.019" end="00:10:46.100" style="s2">like I say is controversial issue learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.089" end="00:10:48.050" style="s2">teach you didn&#39;t but yeah it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.100" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">me at the moment to grasp on to how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.050" end="00:10:53.389" style="s2">differentiate these two things or all</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:54.679" style="s2">that I that I should differentiate them</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.389" end="00:10:57.350" style="s2">but think of it this way I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.679" end="00:10:59.480" style="s2">consciousness in most cases if it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.350" end="00:11:01.699" style="s2">work so-called phenomenal no access</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.480" end="00:11:03.589" style="s2">consciousness which is awareness is by</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.699" end="00:11:05.540" style="s2">definition awareness or phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.589" end="00:11:07.399" style="s2">whereas the will in most cases is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.540" end="00:11:09.139" style="s2">subconscious you know it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.399" end="00:11:11.720" style="s2">we&#39;re necessarily aware of and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.139" end="00:11:14.119" style="s2">one of the sort of purposes of therapy</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:16.639" style="s2">often is to become aware of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.119" end="00:11:18.619" style="s2">subconscious will and then somehow align</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.639" end="00:11:20.029" style="s2">one&#39;s consciousness to that becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.619" end="00:11:22.369" style="s2">harmony with oneself as it were</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.029" end="00:11:24.559" style="s2">absolutely young it might be something</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.369" end="00:11:27.019" style="s2">like to become aware of the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.559" end="00:11:28.610" style="s2">at play in the entirety of your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.019" end="00:11:30.799" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t he call that individuation</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.610" end="00:11:32.809" style="s2">ultimately yeah so it&#39;s something akin</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.799" end="00:11:34.040" style="s2">to that and also interestingly with Jung</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.809" end="00:11:35.569" style="s2">in relation to the fingers always been</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.040" end="00:11:37.549" style="s2">speaking about as the the shadow you</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.569" end="00:11:39.139" style="s2">know on the main archetypes yes the dark</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.549" end="00:11:40.850" style="s2">side as it were and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.139" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">that Nietzsche I think gets one in touch</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.850" end="00:11:45.079" style="s2">with more than anyone else well no I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.149" style="s2">think it&#39;s so important because of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.079" end="00:11:49.490" style="s2">course to be aware of the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.149" end="00:11:51.829" style="s2">for good in life just very generally I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.490" end="00:11:53.449" style="s2">think you only get there by recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.829" end="00:11:58.790" style="s2">and living with the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.449" end="00:12:01.699" style="s2">coin to the bad if you only knew the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.790" end="00:12:03.350" style="s2">power yeah yeah of the dark side but</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.699" end="00:12:04.429" style="s2">yeah well why do we call it the dark</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.350" end="00:12:05.569" style="s2">side though because you know from</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.429" end="00:12:07.309" style="s2">Nietzschean point of view well because</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.569" end="00:12:09.470" style="s2">our morals have become completely skewed</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.309" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">so you know we we often think of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.470" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">sort of you know the morbid of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:16.429" style="s2">Gothic or whatever somehow you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.850" end="00:12:18.019" style="s2">equivalent to an evil but if you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.429" end="00:12:19.639" style="s2">beyond good and evil as Nietzsche says</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.019" end="00:12:21.769" style="s2">and then you don&#39;t see it that way you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.639" end="00:12:23.779" style="s2">see it&#39;s another aspect of reality a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.769" end="00:12:25.249" style="s2">like the false dichotomy between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.779" end="00:12:27.980" style="s2">organic and inorganic through Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.249" end="00:12:30.589" style="s2">and others say if one thinks that way in</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.980" end="00:12:32.839" style="s2">advance and then one has an experienced</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.589" end="00:12:34.790" style="s2">psychedelic experience of typically</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.839" end="00:12:36.589" style="s2">morbid things like skulls and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.790" end="00:12:38.089" style="s2">whatever then one can accept it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.589" end="00:12:40.100" style="s2">endorse it you know and bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.089" end="00:12:41.779" style="s2">oneself and let make it in rich one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:43.389" style="s2">life and perhaps that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.779" end="00:12:46.069" style="s2">element of what what Jung calls</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.389" end="00:12:48.439" style="s2">individuation yes no absolutely I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.069" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s fundamentally crucial to do so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.439" end="00:12:51.559" style="s2">I&#39;m Jordan Pederson always makes this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:53.029" style="s2">point referencing soul Janet&#39;s and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.559" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">mentioned it before in the podcast but</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.029" end="00:12:55.400" style="s2">that the line between good and evil runs</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:57.950" style="s2">through every he</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.400" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">and heart and so I wonder if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.950" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">analogy there to transcending the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:04.130" style="s2">recognition that you have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.680" style="s2">for the most heinous acts of evil as</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.130" end="00:13:09.290" style="s2">well as you do for good is perhaps some</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.680" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">some way analogous to going beyond good</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.290" end="00:13:13.280" style="s2">and evil I don&#39;t know about that so but</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">the thing for me is that and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.280" end="00:13:18.890" style="s2">idea I keep harping back to here if on</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:21.320" style="s2">the Nietzschean kind of view where it</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.890" end="00:13:24.290" style="s2">sort of looks to reveal the arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.320" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">nature of our current value structure of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:28.940" style="s2">values of this particular culture that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:30.530" style="s2">they might as well just have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.940" end="00:13:33.530" style="s2">another way or that we may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.530" end="00:13:36.020" style="s2">transcend them in some in some way even</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.530" end="00:13:39.710" style="s2">that process needs to be subservient to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.020" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">should it be for life is the process</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.710" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">that enables that adaptation itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">right because if not if you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">a certain fixed morality of particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:52.190" style="s2">beliefs and actions and even a knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.190" end="00:13:56.900" style="s2">have their stagnation and you have not</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.900" end="00:14:01.130" style="s2">out into the unknown and it&#39;s the in</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.790" end="00:14:03.950" style="s2">this is the classic story reference</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.130" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">mythically over and over throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.950" end="00:14:09.770" style="s2">history of of the world really that the</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.450" end="00:14:16.270" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work and in my view it</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.060" end="00:14:19.640" style="s2">grounds at the end of the day his</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.270" end="00:14:22.760" style="s2">popularity so ultimately representing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.640" end="00:14:24.710" style="s2">sort of conflict in the social harmony</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.760" end="00:14:27.020" style="s2">to thereby overcome it and keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.710" end="00:14:29.270" style="s2">on does that what it is yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.020" end="00:14:31.340" style="s2">recognizing that there will always be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.270" end="00:14:33.500" style="s2">that there is always an interplay</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.340" end="00:14:35.930" style="s2">between order and chaos and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.500" end="00:14:37.370" style="s2">structures should they maintain a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.930" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">nature for too long tend toward</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.370" end="00:14:42.080" style="s2">corruption because they don&#39;t make use</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:43.430" style="s2">of the left would say immigrants if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.080" end="00:14:45.590" style="s2">take you to this really surface level</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.430" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2">and the right would say no no let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.590" end="00:14:48.590" style="s2">more walls up let&#39;s put more borders up</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">we can&#39;t we don&#39;t want to take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.590" end="00:14:52.400" style="s2">unknown things are good as they are we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:54.350" style="s2">have the sanctuary here but no the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.400" end="00:14:56.180" style="s2">sanctuary and that and the life is to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.350" end="00:14:59.090" style="s2">found in the eternal harmonization</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.180" end="00:15:00.650" style="s2">mm-hmm and and so the process of logos</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.090" end="00:15:03.470" style="s2">then becomes that which can mediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.650" end="00:15:05.690" style="s2">between order and chaos in in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.470" end="00:15:07.190" style="s2">and communication and so what one method</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.690" end="00:15:08.810" style="s2">though I know of that of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.190" end="00:15:10.820" style="s2">famous Nord</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.810" end="00:15:13.430" style="s2">Pantheon and Ragnarok which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.820" end="00:15:15.590" style="s2">gods maintain order the Giants you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.430" end="00:15:17.420" style="s2">try to maintain chaos and that will come</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.590" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">to a final conflict in Ragnarok whether</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.420" end="00:15:22.190" style="s2">Giants will win but that will usher in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">new age and thus it continues well</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.190" end="00:15:26.630" style="s2">absolutely in if chaos overwhelms there</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:27.410" style="s2">is the potential for radically new order</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.630" end="00:15:29.540" style="s2">to come of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.410" end="00:15:31.640" style="s2">this is whitehead you notice ISM in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.540" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">different ages the notion of importance</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.640" end="00:15:37.010" style="s2">ultimate value is sometimes placed into</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">religion and other times into morality I</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.010" end="00:15:40.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we&#39;re living in now</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.150" end="00:15:42.740" style="s2">another times logical reason and other</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.280" end="00:15:45.470" style="s2">times art but importance transcends all</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.740" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">of those and it can fluctuate and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.470" end="00:15:50.150" style="s2">whatever sort of become settled and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:52.460" style="s2">established really you know for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.150" end="00:15:54.890" style="s2">progress and while it does believe in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.460" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">progress for the progress of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.890" end="00:15:58.700" style="s2">universe which is a sort of manifested</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">within life forms there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.700" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">constantly be questioning because</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:04.340" style="s2">ultimately to the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:07.130" style="s2">ultimately questioning and being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.340" end="00:16:09.350" style="s2">contrarian and criticism because without</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.130" end="00:16:12.050" style="s2">it yeah as you say we can never attain</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.350" end="00:16:14.960" style="s2">full knowledge mm-hmm so any ideology</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.050" end="00:16:17.450" style="s2">which claims it is immediately begins to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.960" end="00:16:18.710" style="s2">stagnate and that&#39;s where you get think</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.450" end="00:16:21.980" style="s2">then you get the figures in history</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.710" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">which are the sort of the hammers as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.980" end="00:16:26.270" style="s2">were Nietzsche&#39;s one of them Luther</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:28.040" style="s2">another one you know the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.270" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">thing it doesn&#39;t need to be of any size</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.040" end="00:16:32.870" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just something contrary to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:34.730" style="s2">what is common so if Nietzsche was if</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.870" end="00:16:36.440" style="s2">that if you can you know hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.730" end="00:16:39.050" style="s2">imagine Nietzsche in a different culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.440" end="00:16:40.790" style="s2">he might have been a massive a Lutheran</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.050" end="00:16:42.530" style="s2">criticizing atheism or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.790" end="00:16:45.200" style="s2">but he&#39;d bring it his tools to bear the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.530" end="00:16:47.570" style="s2">important thing probably is well this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.200" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">arguable but the ultimate aim is then</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.570" end="00:16:51.950" style="s2">progress but not in their typical</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">not in typical meaning of progress of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.950" end="00:16:55.760" style="s2">course you know what is progress well</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">yeah this is the interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.760" end="00:16:59.000" style="s2">you know what do we mean by I mean again</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.090" style="s2">for Nietzsche&#39;s its power and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.000" end="00:17:04.340" style="s2">that&#39;s manifested through complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.090" end="00:17:07.090" style="s2">you know like how do we rescue values</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.340" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">that can sustain life from mere power I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.090" end="00:17:11.330" style="s2">mean that might not be the fairest</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:15.710" style="s2">question but life from your power so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.330" end="00:17:17.000" style="s2">people like Foucault and Derrida I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.710" end="00:17:18.590" style="s2">familiar with these thinkers Beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.000" end="00:17:20.510" style="s2">really introductions you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.590" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">secondary sources I&#39;ve read some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.510" end="00:17:24.949" style="s2">works but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:28.760" style="s2">there is a reliance on a notion of power</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.949" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">as that which ultimately is manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.760" end="00:17:34.100" style="s2">by human beings for their own ends</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:36.350" style="s2">they don&#39;t give an end beyond just power</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.100" end="00:17:38.840" style="s2">it sort of bottoms out at this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.350" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">structures just seek power there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.840" end="00:17:45.500" style="s2">notion really of a type of aesthetic or</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:47.539" style="s2">or competence that can stand outside</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.500" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">where is the tea loss where is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.539" end="00:17:52.429" style="s2">striving if it&#39;s just if it&#39;s just power</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">and for me for me it has to be grounded</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.429" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">in in their affirmation or rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.100" style="s2">life itself and there we start bringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">back in these notions of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.100" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">metaphorically to constitute this</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:06.350" style="s2">decision to be for life or against life</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:08.539" style="s2">and so what we have then as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.350" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">understanding of evil to understand some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.539" end="00:18:11.539" style="s2">of the accident that take place in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:13.580" style="s2">inside inside the heart of every human</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.539" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">being can be characterized more as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.580" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">resentment for the conditions of life</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">itself which are the suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">tragedy that are endemic to any system</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">that must continually destroy itself in</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:28.130" style="s2">order to rebuild itself and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:30.440" style="s2">the inherent arbitrariness of them of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.130" end="00:18:32.120" style="s2">this polarity of chaos and order and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.440" end="00:18:34.610" style="s2">fact that we balance on a nice set</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.120" end="00:18:36.230" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge and must harmonize at once</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.610" end="00:18:38.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a wonderfully optimistic view of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.230" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">life but on another it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.120" end="00:18:42.140" style="s2">naively so because because the figure</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:43.789" style="s2">that binds it together in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.140" end="00:18:45.890" style="s2">at least is the figure of the cross and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.789" end="00:18:48.289" style="s2">you have the suffering born there by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.890" end="00:18:49.400" style="s2">individual in the face of this so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.289" end="00:18:52.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.400" end="00:18:55.309" style="s2">that yeah so obviously the roots are as</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.760" end="00:18:58.309" style="s2">humans are on in terms of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.309" end="00:19:00.740" style="s2">general mental advancement technological</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.309" end="00:19:02.330" style="s2">advance from now is one that has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.740" end="00:19:05.900" style="s2">involve suffering in fact not just</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.330" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">humans but but but all beings but humans</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.900" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">of course because we have this the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">unfortunate side effect of being very</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:14.750" style="s2">intelligent and being able to create</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:17.870" style="s2">medicine and technology and weapons</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.750" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">whatever is also the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.870" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">conscious of suffering and always not</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:24.020" style="s2">just feel it</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">but you know really suffer because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.020" end="00:19:28.250" style="s2">love you know mostly I would say because</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:29.780" style="s2">a loved one has died you know yes more</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.250" end="00:19:31.820" style="s2">than oneself I think especially with</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.780" end="00:19:33.169" style="s2">children so that it goes hand in hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.820" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">that heightened consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.169" end="00:19:40.390" style="s2">awareness of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:42.750" style="s2">so by that principle if we were to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.390" end="00:19:45.909" style="s2">the next evolutionary step then</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.750" end="00:19:47.559" style="s2">suffering would also take that step with</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.909" end="00:19:50.409" style="s2">us the suffering is only going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.559" end="00:19:52.510" style="s2">increase yeah yes so with it with it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.409" end="00:19:53.650" style="s2">of course the people like David Pierce</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.510" end="00:19:55.510" style="s2">they think that we can eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.650" end="00:19:57.130" style="s2">suffering all together and become more</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.510" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">conscious and whatever I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.130" end="00:20:00.280" style="s2">skeptical about I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:02.650" style="s2">possible because I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.280" end="00:20:04.360" style="s2">happiness is really the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.650" end="00:20:05.770" style="s2">the coin of suffering you know without</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.360" end="00:20:09.010" style="s2">suffering you won&#39;t you just be bored</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.770" end="00:20:10.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a relational duality and them but</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.010" end="00:20:14.200" style="s2">what do I think about Christ then being</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.630" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">a sort of a figure too and I sympathize</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.200" end="00:20:17.260" style="s2">with when one is suffering I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">there&#39;s also dangers there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.260" end="00:20:22.390" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s it brings comfort in us</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:24.789" style="s2">arguably one of its main purposes but at</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.390" end="00:20:26.740" style="s2">the same time I mean C D broad who</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.789" end="00:20:29.260" style="s2">actually spoke about to bring it back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.740" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">him he wrote that one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.260" end="00:20:36.280" style="s2">dangers of Christianity is to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:38.380" style="s2">advancement of man through you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.280" end="00:20:40.270" style="s2">technological or whatever means genetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.380" end="00:20:42.340" style="s2">means so we&#39;re bordering on eugenics</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.270" end="00:20:43.659" style="s2">here a bit but there was before the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.340" end="00:20:45.429" style="s2">Second World War those are you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.659" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">being a liberal generally was being a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.429" end="00:20:49.480" style="s2">eugenicist and so there is another I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:50.830" style="s2">promoting eugenics of course but there</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.480" end="00:20:52.539" style="s2">is a danger with Christianity and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.830" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">is from Nietzsche and point of view as</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.539" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">well of stifling the development of man</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:20:59.830" style="s2">because yeah it does bring more</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:01.990" style="s2">suffering and so on and if we only think</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.830" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">if we focus on suffering as the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.990" end="00:21:06.909" style="s2">ultimate value of humanity then I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:10.090" style="s2">that will then yeah hinder a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.909" end="00:21:11.650" style="s2">potential not only pleasures but other</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.090" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">forms of consciousness of which we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.650" end="00:21:15.880" style="s2">only touch upon you know so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">date but there&#39;s a danger either way</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.880" end="00:21:19.450" style="s2">there&#39;s also a danger that if you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:21.220" style="s2">no consolation well then you know most</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.450" end="00:21:23.289" style="s2">most of humanity will be completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.220" end="00:21:25.780" style="s2">miserable so there&#39;s lots to say here I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.289" end="00:21:29.530" style="s2">mean I I don&#39;t have the education to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.780" end="00:21:33.159" style="s2">make the case for the continual validity</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.530" end="00:21:35.230" style="s2">of the very best we could say about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.159" end="00:21:37.510" style="s2">Christian picture today what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.230" end="00:21:39.400" style="s2">mean by that is I couldn&#39;t say whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.510" end="00:21:41.080" style="s2">or not they had developed the complete</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.400" end="00:21:42.610" style="s2">mythological representation of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.080" end="00:21:45.010" style="s2">which could ultimately drive us forward</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.610" end="00:21:46.870" style="s2">appropriately something like that and as</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.010" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2">certainly I as far as I understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.870" end="00:21:50.670" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s explication through you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:52.470" style="s2">of Christianity in the symbol of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.670" end="00:21:54.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not merely the identification with</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.470" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">the suffering but also the transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.390" end="00:21:59.550" style="s2">that by taking responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:22:01.800" style="s2">speaking the truth fundamentally that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.550" end="00:22:03.900" style="s2">that is the pathway to transcending or</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.800" end="00:22:05.700" style="s2">bearing at the very least that suffering</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.900" end="00:22:08.790" style="s2">and so sort of keeps it in balance so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.700" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">don&#39;t think but regardless I think one</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.790" end="00:22:13.790" style="s2">attitude that I think I&#39;m trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:17.460" style="s2">here or arguing for as part of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.790" end="00:22:20.520" style="s2">adaptive revivification of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.460" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">is at all times to be gracious and to to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.520" end="00:22:24.540" style="s2">take the best and to save the best of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.590" end="00:22:26.100" style="s2">what your of your of what your culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.540" end="00:22:28.670" style="s2">can give to you and of course then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.100" end="00:22:31.050" style="s2">update it now we have room to add</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.670" end="00:22:33.270" style="s2">basically well yeah and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.050" end="00:22:34.830" style="s2">comes to mind immediately is again from</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.270" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">Whitehead this notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.830" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">Reformation was bad because it took the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">worst from Christianity from his point</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.380" style="s2">of view so the great thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:45.060" style="s2">Catholic Church or the church as it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.380" end="00:22:47.910" style="s2">then more or less excluding the Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.060" end="00:22:49.980" style="s2">one was the aesthetic side you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.910" end="00:22:53.130" style="s2">these great cathedrals stained-glass</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.980" end="00:22:56.010" style="s2">sunlight coming in these these sublime</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.130" end="00:22:57.630" style="s2">music even the mass and Latin the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.010" end="00:23:00.450" style="s2">of it was that one didn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.630" end="00:23:04.280" style="s2">you know he&#39;s arguing and that the value</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.450" end="00:23:07.110" style="s2">of the church then was mostly the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.280" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">evocation of an aesthetic sensibility of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.110" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">an understanding that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">beyond oneself yes and it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">necessarily vague because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">can never attain certainty there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:16.530" style="s2">and what happened with the Reformation</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:20.190" style="s2">of course is that them all this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.530" end="00:23:21.390" style="s2">so-called ostentation was lost and there</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.190" end="00:23:23.910" style="s2">was more focus on you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.390" end="00:23:25.680" style="s2">translation of the Bible into the net</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.910" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">whatever language German English and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.680" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">on and you know a sort of purification</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:31.080" style="s2">of the church so it became very simple</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:32.670" style="s2">we know white walls whatever like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.080" end="00:23:35.640" style="s2">still get in Sweden hmm it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.670" end="00:23:36.810" style="s2">Lutheran Calvinist look and then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.640" end="00:23:38.280" style="s2">know natural theology</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.810" end="00:23:40.290" style="s2">you know rational arguments for why</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.280" end="00:23:42.540" style="s2">there&#39;s an afterlife why there&#39;s a God</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.290" end="00:23:43.800" style="s2">and whatever I&#39;m all of which I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.540" end="00:23:46.800" style="s2">most philosophers will say that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.800" end="00:23:48.330" style="s2">fail you know yeah although there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.800" end="00:23:49.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not an argument but there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.330" end="00:23:51.750" style="s2">reason for believing God which is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.620" end="00:23:53.340" style="s2">argument from experience which actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:55.470" style="s2">is another reason I was brought to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.340" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">psychedelics through William James you</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.470" end="00:23:59.070" style="s2">know right so but you know that was not</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:00.840" style="s2">a rational argument thus there was no</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.070" end="00:24:02.550" style="s2">rational criticisms of it that was an</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.840" end="00:24:05.160" style="s2">experience all</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.550" end="00:24:07.530" style="s2">right so yeah other things to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.160" end="00:24:10.020" style="s2">from the church absolutely even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.530" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">great Antichrist nature&#39;s said that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.020" end="00:24:14.040" style="s2">know the yes and why it certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">sympathetic as I say to the evocative</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">and the aesthetic principles of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:17.880" style="s2">Christianity less to the theology</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:20.070" style="s2">although there&#39;s the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.880" end="00:24:22.050" style="s2">theology that as um was born through</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.070" end="00:24:25.050" style="s2">whiteheads in America nonetheless I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.050" end="00:24:27.300" style="s2">think that really veered far too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.050" end="00:24:29.580" style="s2">just too far away from whiteheads</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.300" end="00:24:31.500" style="s2">intention nonetheless you know it was it</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.580" end="00:24:34.530" style="s2">was very inspirational so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.500" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2">there can be there are well without</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.530" end="00:24:38.580" style="s2">question values in Christianity even</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:40.590" style="s2">walking into a church and in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.580" end="00:24:42.510" style="s2">of a city as I their necks at a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.590" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">weeks ago it was just so tranquil and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.510" end="00:24:46.770" style="s2">calm it&#39;s just a pity that it comes with</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:48.840" style="s2">a lot of this theological baggage you</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.770" end="00:24:50.250" style="s2">know but there&#39;s a need for I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.840" end="00:24:52.860" style="s2">the Eleusinian mysteries there is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.250" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">there is this I dance a spiritual but</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.860" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">there is this need to get outside of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:24:57.930" style="s2">everyday life for all people you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">shopping now again speaks about a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.930" end="00:25:01.620" style="s2">metaphysical need we all have I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:04.170" style="s2">it&#39;s there and I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.620" end="00:25:06.060" style="s2">sort of um let&#39;s say disharmony and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.170" end="00:25:07.770" style="s2">society in Western society today is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.060" end="00:25:09.180" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve become so intellectualize</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.770" end="00:25:10.770" style="s2">that we can&#39;t buy Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.180" end="00:25:12.390" style="s2">you can encapsulate and goddess death</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.770" end="00:25:13.620" style="s2">the phrase God is dead however the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.390" end="00:25:16.350" style="s2">metaphysical need I believe is still</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.620" end="00:25:18.780" style="s2">there right what replaces that what</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.350" end="00:25:20.580" style="s2">replaces that yeah so so then you get um</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.780" end="00:25:23.340" style="s2">then you get these sort of New Age</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.580" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">movements and so on and also communism</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.340" end="00:25:29.100" style="s2">pet neo-paganism and fascism of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:31.830" style="s2">right yeah that is a demonstration of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.100" end="00:25:34.290" style="s2">this fixation of what turned out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.830" end="00:25:37.710" style="s2">very shallow system of values but a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.290" end="00:25:39.510" style="s2">fixation of them as the top god of your</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.710" end="00:25:41.310" style="s2">value structure that then cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.510" end="00:25:43.250" style="s2">challenged and Solzhenitsyn explicates</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.310" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">this as right at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.250" end="00:25:46.920" style="s2">unwillingness of people to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">truth to tell the truth of their own</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.920" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">suffering and therefore fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:54.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no revivification possible there</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.680" style="s2">and you have millions dead yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.360" end="00:25:57.420" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating actually Nietzsche says</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.680" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">you know Christianity killed itself in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.420" end="00:26:00.660" style="s2">terms of seeking truth and it&#39;s it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:02.070" style="s2">sort of truth away from it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.660" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">Nietzsche thought nothing interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.070" end="00:26:05.910" style="s2">about communism of course and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.070" style="s2">Bertrand Russell said you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.910" end="00:26:10.760" style="s2">complete match between Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.070" end="00:26:14.010" style="s2">communism you know so the messiahís Marx</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.760" end="00:26:15.779" style="s2">the elect are the proletariat you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.010" end="00:26:17.309" style="s2">and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.779" end="00:26:19.529" style="s2">Nietzsche although he was concomitant</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.309" end="00:26:21.539" style="s2">with Marx he criticized socialism for</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.529" end="00:26:23.070" style="s2">being a legacy of Christianity so on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.539" end="00:26:24.749" style="s2">one side we get the continuation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.070" end="00:26:26.999" style="s2">Christianity through socialism communism</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.749" end="00:26:28.799" style="s2">one could argue and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.999" end="00:26:30.539" style="s2">that metaphysical need was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.799" end="00:26:32.399" style="s2">brought out in New Age neo-pagan</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.539" end="00:26:33.989" style="s2">movements and so on and they were both</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.399" end="00:26:36.239" style="s2">in a way the kind of split of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.989" end="00:26:38.729" style="s2">Christianity after after it reached this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.239" end="00:26:40.529" style="s2">this intellectual point where it just</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.729" end="00:26:41.519" style="s2">people could not accept it very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.529" end="00:26:43.169" style="s2">especially with you know higher</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.519" end="00:26:44.879" style="s2">criticism from Germany you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.169" end="00:26:46.739" style="s2">questioning of who wrote the Bible and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.879" end="00:26:48.299" style="s2">the evolution of court Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.739" end="00:26:49.649" style="s2">evolution mmm-hmm they reached this</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.299" end="00:26:51.509" style="s2">intellectual point where it couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.649" end="00:26:53.099" style="s2">justified anymore so yeah then you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.509" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">the split off which is communism slap</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.099" end="00:26:55.649" style="s2">okay we still believe that all are equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:26:57.839" style="s2">under the eyes of God how we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.649" end="00:27:00.210" style="s2">create that in a political system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.839" end="00:27:01.799" style="s2">and then if you get the rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.210" end="00:27:03.239" style="s2">that you get well you know there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.799" end="00:27:04.830" style="s2">this need to believe in something higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.239" end="00:27:06.330" style="s2">than us something more important than us</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.830" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">you know it seems to me the New Age</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.330" end="00:27:09.330" style="s2">movement didn&#39;t know where to place that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:10.409" style="s2">at all and of course nihilism is on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.330" end="00:27:12.239" style="s2">other side of that as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.409" end="00:27:14.519" style="s2">nothing we there&#39;s just can&#39;t be nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.239" end="00:27:16.289" style="s2">there and so you sort of in this in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.519" end="00:27:19.019" style="s2">different kind of static in the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.289" end="00:27:21.479" style="s2">here in the abyss yeah so and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.019" end="00:27:23.549" style="s2">ultimately all of that of course led to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.479" end="00:27:25.559" style="s2">existentialism of 20th century you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.549" end="00:27:27.109" style="s2">this notion of like what the hell no</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.559" end="00:27:29.969" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here pick up the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.109" end="00:27:31.229" style="s2">yeah and and it seems we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.969" end="00:27:33.809" style="s2">dealing with that right I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.229" end="00:27:35.489" style="s2">society is come to any form of harmony</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.809" end="00:27:37.529" style="s2">and I if it were to come to any harmony</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.489" end="00:27:39.509" style="s2">with it like some new kind of illusion</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.529" end="00:27:41.700" style="s2">and mystery then that could easily</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.509" end="00:27:43.529" style="s2">stagnate again and you&#39;d need but</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.700" end="00:27:45.059" style="s2">nonetheless all of that is I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.529" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">almost certainly Hegelian now you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.059" end="00:27:49.139" style="s2">thesis antithesis to synthesis but</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:52.019" style="s2">nonetheless if we believe in I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.139" end="00:27:53.729" style="s2">so with nihilism yeah you know I&#39;m a you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.019" end="00:27:55.669" style="s2">know what I call neo analysts so I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.729" end="00:27:58.349" style="s2">believe that there are no objective</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.669" end="00:28:00.210" style="s2">normative values could we call them</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.349" end="00:28:02.119" style="s2">fixed values in its sense just to help</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.210" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">me out get on board so yeah fixed</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.119" end="00:28:06.839" style="s2">objective values so like there is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:08.789" style="s2">absolute good and absolute evil you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.839" end="00:28:11.969" style="s2">so you look that takes on a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.789" end="00:28:14.969" style="s2">instantiated form that&#39;s codified into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.969" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">certain set of epitome avert is the 10</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.969" end="00:28:17.669" style="s2">commandments you know so I think I this</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:19.379" style="s2">god-given but if you don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.669" end="00:28:21.539" style="s2">God and if you don&#39;t believe in platonic</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.379" end="00:28:22.859" style="s2">forms then you&#39;ve got no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.539" end="00:28:25.169" style="s2">believe in that this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.859" end="00:28:27.239" style="s2">point if god is dead again also if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.169" end="00:28:28.289" style="s2">don&#39;t believe an Altima purpose then of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.239" end="00:28:29.490" style="s2">course you know if you know the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.289" end="00:28:31.170" style="s2">of something then you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.490" end="00:28:32.370" style="s2">that something is good for that or yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.170" end="00:28:34.260" style="s2">you know the purpose of knives to cut</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.370" end="00:28:36.450" style="s2">you know good knife as a sharp one right</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.260" end="00:28:38.460" style="s2">but if a man this is existentialism now</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.450" end="00:28:39.780" style="s2">if man has no purpose and hacking talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.460" end="00:28:41.790" style="s2">about good or a bad man you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.780" end="00:28:43.380" style="s2">without that now maybe we still have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.790" end="00:28:44.520" style="s2">purpose we&#39;ll come back to that yes but</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.380" end="00:28:46.470" style="s2">if you don&#39;t believe it you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.470" end="00:28:51.390" style="s2">you believe only in then well first of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.260" end="00:28:53.820" style="s2">all and if you look at the you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.390" end="00:28:55.620" style="s2">different cultures around time and space</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.820" end="00:28:57.540" style="s2">you know you realize that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.620" end="00:28:58.770" style="s2">Victorian age it was immoral to for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.540" end="00:29:01.020" style="s2">woman to show a wrist or something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.770" end="00:29:02.970" style="s2">this yes today it&#39;s immoral to you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.020" end="00:29:04.770" style="s2">whatever touch woman&#39;s knee yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.970" end="00:29:05.730" style="s2">today and in 50 years is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.770" end="00:29:07.080" style="s2">something else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.730" end="00:29:08.730" style="s2">you become a relativist just from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.080" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">historical sense as well very easy to</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">so there&#39;s neo nihilism it in the basic</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.179" end="00:29:15.929" style="s2">form it&#39;s just that yeah there can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:17.250" style="s2">any prescript if you can&#39;t say a person</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.250" end="00:29:21.150" style="s2">because according to what yes i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.150" end="00:29:25.260" style="s2">however there are still values</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.040" end="00:29:26.610" style="s2">subjective values right and of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.260" end="00:29:28.740" style="s2">nobody wants just because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.610" end="00:29:30.420" style="s2">believe in an eternal God or a</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.540" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">course not you know there&#39;s still</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:39.960" style="s2">are objective values is two very</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.340" end="00:29:41.910" style="s2">separate things so you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.960" end="00:29:44.370" style="s2">your characteristics which are based on</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.910" end="00:29:46.770" style="s2">partly based on your subjective values</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.370" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">and you can still strive to push those</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.770" end="00:29:51.300" style="s2">subjective values in society so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:53.280" style="s2">still maintain a political viewpoint you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.300" end="00:29:54.900" style="s2">know let&#39;s say you don&#39;t like rubbish</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.280" end="00:29:56.460" style="s2">around your village or something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.900" end="00:29:58.500" style="s2">this yeah that&#39;s a personal thing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.460" end="00:29:59.880" style="s2">you could therefore it instantiate you</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.500" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">know policies which will get rid of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.880" end="00:30:03.750" style="s2">you know bins and whatever but of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">if someone worth theoretically they</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.750" end="00:30:06.330" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen in this case but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">theoretically someone today you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.330" end="00:30:10.950" style="s2">what I like I like rubbish around you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:13.170" style="s2">can say well you&#39;re wrong yes at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.950" end="00:30:15.150" style="s2">fundamental point you then you the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.170" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">nihilism steps in again you and you say</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.150" end="00:30:18.780" style="s2">well let I&#39;m just pushing I&#39;m afraid um</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:20.520" style="s2">this is just a conflict like a fight I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.780" end="00:30:21.870" style="s2">going to fight you for this yes but</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.520" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what it comes down to a fight and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.870" end="00:30:25.920" style="s2">okay in that example you know that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:28.230" style="s2">never happen but think about abortion</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.920" end="00:30:30.360" style="s2">yes now if here is abortion right so at</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.230" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">the fundamental level it&#39;s about whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.360" end="00:30:35.100" style="s2">you think an embryo has intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.179" end="00:30:36.809" style="s2">and there&#39;s just unless you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.100" end="00:30:38.520" style="s2">religious if you&#39;re not religious if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.809" end="00:30:41.850" style="s2">reject that and you have you&#39;ve rejected</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.520" end="00:30:43.290" style="s2">standards as well like an ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.850" end="00:30:44.970" style="s2">secular ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.290" end="00:30:47.130" style="s2">secular morality is like utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.970" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">do have this absolute standards in other</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.130" end="00:30:50.610" style="s2">words pleasure is good pain is bad there</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.140" style="s2">comes a point where you can&#39;t argue the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.610" end="00:30:54.990" style="s2">case anymore there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.140" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">fundamental justification either way</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.990" end="00:30:59.340" style="s2">right now unless it becomes theological</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">me because Muni might say well the value</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.340" end="00:31:03.090" style="s2">of charts got given so ok so let&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.120" style="s2">debate whether God exists you know so</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.090" end="00:31:08.760" style="s2">right but also it might be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:10.500" style="s2">a trivial argument about whether there</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.760" end="00:31:13.950" style="s2">should be rubbish or not so it devolves</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.500" end="00:31:15.660" style="s2">into a sort of a fixed moment in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.950" end="00:31:18.780" style="s2">debating such a thing one is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.660" end="00:31:21.420" style="s2">intellectualizing away from the real as</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.780" end="00:31:23.430" style="s2">it moves in qualitative duration and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.420" end="00:31:26.070" style="s2">this is a bit of a jump now to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.430" end="00:31:28.740" style="s2">Bergson back in here but if we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.070" end="00:31:30.870" style="s2">committed to the idea that the real is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.740" end="00:31:33.810" style="s2">movement and that what is most real</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.870" end="00:31:35.580" style="s2">about being itself is that or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.810" end="00:31:37.950" style="s2">what characterizes it more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.580" end="00:31:39.990" style="s2">else is its movement then it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.950" end="00:31:41.670" style="s2">in order to preserve what its most real</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.990" end="00:31:44.450" style="s2">what we need to hold as our highest</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.670" end="00:31:47.280" style="s2">value is the kind of communicative</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.450" end="00:31:50.180" style="s2">Reformation behavior fundamentally that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:53.970" style="s2">is most aligned to to movement and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.180" end="00:31:56.490" style="s2">adaptation itself and so you see well</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.970" end="00:31:58.140" style="s2">there though I bring in pluralism you</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.490" end="00:32:00.300" style="s2">know so there are movements there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.140" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">directions but they are there are many</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.300" end="00:32:05.430" style="s2">and times are not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:07.260" style="s2">you know mutually compatible right can</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.430" end="00:32:09.090" style="s2">they be entirely disparate I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:11.370" style="s2">might be the question or well no they</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.090" end="00:32:13.680" style="s2">can&#39;t here is whether the grand nodal</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.370" end="00:32:15.780" style="s2">structure of being and movement can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.680" end="00:32:18.930" style="s2">disparate from itself and in such a case</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.780" end="00:32:22.200" style="s2">it seems like all one would have there</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.930" end="00:32:24.900" style="s2">is power to distinguish but if these</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.200" end="00:32:29.040" style="s2">nodes of order and being are connected</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.900" end="00:32:31.590" style="s2">and in fact built on this same effective</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.040" end="00:32:34.620" style="s2">Tilos listener movement this movement</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">out of fixation which can which in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.620" end="00:32:41.520" style="s2">to be for itself is for being is for</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:43.710" style="s2">life given that we are wrapped up it we</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.520" end="00:32:47.190" style="s2">are manifestations of this process at</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.710" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">the highest form we&#39;ve we know ok so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.190" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">I I notice your way yeah ultimately its</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.380" end="00:32:53.890" style="s2">concerns this the sort of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:56.530" style="s2">between care you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.890" end="00:32:58.930" style="s2">different harmonies so certain minor</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.530" end="00:33:01.900" style="s2">harmonies would be chaotic to a larger</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.930" end="00:33:04.540" style="s2">one yes so like a biker gang might in</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.900" end="00:33:05.350" style="s2">itself be very harmonious follow laws of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.540" end="00:33:08.470" style="s2">Honor and so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:11.170" style="s2">but in terms of a state it might be very</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.470" end="00:33:16.060" style="s2">disharmony as&#39; so then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.170" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">should that smaller state the gang give</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.060" end="00:33:21.820" style="s2">in to harmonize with the larger one or</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:24.670" style="s2">does the large one actually benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.820" end="00:33:27.460" style="s2">some disharmony absolutely does it sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.670" end="00:33:28.750" style="s2">of shake its foundations and make make</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.460" end="00:33:30.730" style="s2">it sort of question what it really</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">values and so on could be that depending</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.730" end="00:33:34.090" style="s2">couldn&#39;t yeah I mean you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:36.040" style="s2">low key isn&#39;t the low the trickster</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.090" end="00:33:37.750" style="s2">archetype something very common right</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.040" end="00:33:40.090" style="s2">you know there needs to be that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.750" end="00:33:42.220" style="s2">that&#39;s shaking up constantly to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.090" end="00:33:45.040" style="s2">harmony perhaps right absolutely it does</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.220" end="00:33:46.390" style="s2">so the danger then of course is ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.040" end="00:33:48.130" style="s2">moralism where you say you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.390" end="00:33:50.470" style="s2">can&#39;t do this you know you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.130" end="00:33:52.060" style="s2">to step in line because then you would</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.470" end="00:33:54.010" style="s2">get a total stagnant state and this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.060" end="00:33:56.400" style="s2">what we see in you know communist Russia</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.010" end="00:33:59.740" style="s2">I suppose in North Korea but not and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.400" end="00:34:01.780" style="s2">also in our society in other ways I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.740" end="00:34:03.820" style="s2">should say I don&#39;t think you can get rid</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.780" end="00:34:05.890" style="s2">of disharmony same within a body as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.820" end="00:34:08.470" style="s2">you know so we&#39;ve got um you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.380" end="00:34:41.020" style="s2">good thing about you notice our</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.370" end="00:34:42.700" style="s2">vaccinations work you know you give it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.020" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">little bit of chaos and then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.700" end="00:34:46.710" style="s2">the larger hold on becomes stronger yeah</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.899" end="00:34:59.690" style="s2">others right I mean there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">type of playing with the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.690" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2">that&#39;s appropriate and certain and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:05.540" style="s2">certain kinds that might appear so</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:07.340" style="s2">initially but ultimately might lead to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.540" end="00:35:09.590" style="s2">the development of our an instantiation</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.590" end="00:35:12.530" style="s2">that is that they&#39;re branches off and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.330" style="s2">becomes incompatible a counselor can</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.330" end="00:35:20.510" style="s2">and so the thing is is that in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.100" end="00:35:23.840" style="s2">grand cog like revolving multi nodal</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.510" end="00:35:26.770" style="s2">structure that is being it has to in</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.770" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">necessarily spawn off elements of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.180" end="00:35:33.980" style="s2">that can actually evolve to challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:35.450" style="s2">and that is why this view is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:37.340" style="s2">inherently optimistic because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.450" end="00:35:40.040" style="s2">maintains the absolute destructive</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.870" end="00:35:46.520" style="s2">the cause of evolution and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.030" end="00:35:48.590" style="s2">cause of us as such in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.520" end="00:35:50.840" style="s2">constant overcoming of obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.590" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">evolving against them in order to attain</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:57.530" style="s2">and so my question when it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:59.840" style="s2">taking a conversation like this which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.530" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">which has gone into the heart of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.840" end="00:36:04.370" style="s2">even appears as I say it to myself a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.680" style="s2">type of esoteric language to action in</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.370" end="00:36:08.810" style="s2">the world you sort of recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.680" end="00:36:11.780" style="s2">well people the world over are it are</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.810" end="00:36:14.330" style="s2">involved in starting little projects and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:17.090" style="s2">then maintaining them and then providing</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.330" end="00:36:20.360" style="s2">value to people or not and we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.090" end="00:36:23.180" style="s2">life is this constant collectivizing of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.360" end="00:36:25.640" style="s2">certain values and and activities and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.180" end="00:36:27.620" style="s2">then out there goes that little engine</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.640" end="00:36:29.240" style="s2">of production or doing something and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.620" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">then it does its thing in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.240" end="00:36:33.140" style="s2">it contributes to the grand picture in</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">some way and and you know we have all we</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:39.350" style="s2">moment is characterized by such a such a</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.109" end="00:38:52.759" style="s2">this to you very briefly that the</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.630" end="00:39:41.950" style="s2">Miami or nihilism it&#39;s this that you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.560" end="00:39:58.810" style="s2">thing like campus conflicts as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.900" end="00:40:00.220" style="s2">mentioning I mean sort of neo nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.810" end="00:40:03.130" style="s2">analysis of that would simply be this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.220" end="00:40:05.320" style="s2">that both sides hold well yeah</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.860" end="00:40:24.550" style="s2">an ultimately no way of defending that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.780" end="00:40:26.470" style="s2">on the other side though and I was</p>

<p begin="00:40:39.220" end="00:40:44.410" style="s2">that sort of fight each other but</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.430" end="00:40:45.640" style="s2">personally I take their Milton&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.410" end="00:40:47.800" style="s2">of view the freedom of expression</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.640" end="00:40:49.060" style="s2">because my subjective value which is you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.800" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">know ultimately is progress not in</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.060" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">liberal sense by the progress of over</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:56.500" style="s2">the universe itself through man right</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">and that will be achieved as Milton</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.500" end="00:41:00.220" style="s2">himself argued hundreds of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">through yet debate you know let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.220" end="00:41:05.020" style="s2">put our cards on the table and see how</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:06.610" style="s2">they commensurate I think also with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.020" end="00:41:08.920" style="s2">know the sort D platforming things you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.610" end="00:41:11.980" style="s2">get today from from today&#39;s new left or</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.920" end="00:41:14.170" style="s2">whatever yep it&#39;s just a it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.980" end="00:41:16.840" style="s2">much power politics anyway right it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.170" end="00:41:18.520" style="s2">you know we demand these rights and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.840" end="00:41:20.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t like these old power structures</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.520" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">when you get equality all that means is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.920" end="00:41:26.050" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got a lower power structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">acquiring an equal power structure to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.050" end="00:41:30.430" style="s2">its then nemesis you know its opposite</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:32.080" style="s2">as a way but of course it will never I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.430" end="00:41:33.820" style="s2">don&#39;t think that will ever lie in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.080" end="00:41:35.380" style="s2">harmony I don&#39;t think when equality is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.820" end="00:41:35.859" style="s2">reached that will be it though there</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:37.690" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.859" end="00:41:39.220" style="s2">people who then tried to push it right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.690" end="00:41:40.630" style="s2">and so there&#39;ll be a tonal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.220" end="00:41:41.859" style="s2">there but the ultimate point is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.630" end="00:41:43.720" style="s2">from naio now lism there you know you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.859" end="00:41:46.180" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t substantiate why should</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.720" end="00:41:47.319" style="s2">everyone be equal you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.180" end="00:41:49.150" style="s2">ultimately that&#39;s what it comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.319" end="00:41:50.799" style="s2">it&#39;s harsh right can we distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.150" end="00:41:53.019" style="s2">between equality of opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.799" end="00:41:54.369" style="s2">outcome here yeah I mean I can totally</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.019" end="00:41:56.170" style="s2">get on board from the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.369" end="00:41:57.940" style="s2">equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.170" end="00:41:59.829" style="s2">it&#39;s a ridiculous notion in in the ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.940" end="00:42:01.720" style="s2">you indicate but in terms of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.829" end="00:42:03.009" style="s2">it seems to me that well I I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.720" end="00:42:04.749" style="s2">personally yet you should offer</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.009" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">subjectively I believe you should</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.749" end="00:42:08.859" style="s2">absolutely offer equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.869" style="s2">because that&#39;s for the benefit again of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.859" end="00:42:13.329" style="s2">my subjective view which is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.869" end="00:42:15.400" style="s2">a progress of complexity in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.329" end="00:42:17.319" style="s2">through through mankind however yes that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.400" end="00:42:18.579" style="s2">is my personal preference yes okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.319" end="00:42:19.960" style="s2">understand you&#39;re saying your personal</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.579" end="00:42:23.170" style="s2">preference here but I can also identify</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.960" end="00:42:25.779" style="s2">with that as you being for life as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.170" end="00:42:27.339" style="s2">yeah as you so maybe as I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.779" end="00:42:29.410" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to attach maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.339" end="00:42:30.670" style="s2">is and this as we&#39;ve started with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:32.829" style="s2">talking about this drive for knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.670" end="00:42:36.220" style="s2">yeah maybe there is is greater tell us</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.829" end="00:42:39.069" style="s2">which I embody we all embody for this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.220" end="00:42:41.109" style="s2">kind of ultimate end of continual a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.069" end="00:42:42.519" style="s2">continual striving not only for power</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.109" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">but powers part of it because if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.519" end="00:42:45.430" style="s2">don&#39;t if you can&#39;t control your</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.809" style="s2">environment you&#39;re gonna die right how</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.430" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">are you going to evolve away yes so</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.809" end="00:42:51.249" style="s2">powers part of it but maybe power is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">actually just itself a means to allow</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.249" end="00:42:57.190" style="s2">for expanding complexity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:42:59.470" style="s2">consciousness exact that&#39;s right because</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.190" end="00:43:02.470" style="s2">I think power ends with fixation well in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.470" end="00:43:04.690" style="s2">some ways yeah it&#39;s may perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.470" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">like money you know so money is a great</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.690" end="00:43:09.339" style="s2">means to acquire greater levels but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:12.339" style="s2">if you fixate yourself on money then</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.339" end="00:43:15.279" style="s2">that&#39;s shallow and a valueless in itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.339" end="00:43:17.109" style="s2">however I mean that is very I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.279" end="00:43:18.579" style="s2">say talking about this ultimate tell us</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.109" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">there of complexity is very is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.579" end="00:43:22.779" style="s2">metaphysical and something I can&#39;t prove</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:25.480" style="s2">but but like I said you there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.779" end="00:43:27.220" style="s2">of proving it because it&#39;s metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.480" end="00:43:28.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not science this is where James</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.220" end="00:43:31.589" style="s2">comes in because he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.839" end="00:43:36.430" style="s2">sorry to interrupt no he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.589" end="00:43:38.529" style="s2">like it&#39;s not a nice you said I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.430" end="00:43:42.759" style="s2">need that it&#39;s like a it&#39;s built the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.529" end="00:43:47.019" style="s2">view is built or finally instantiated or</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.759" end="00:43:49.940" style="s2">given its force by a faith that in so</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.019" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">pursuing that communicative reform a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.940" end="00:43:56.430" style="s2">vulnerable truth-seeking that that will</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">bring about the whole project for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.430" end="00:44:01.080" style="s2">better yeah well an analogy would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:03.570" style="s2">something like this our immune system</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.080" end="00:44:06.060" style="s2">right if you look at bacteria virus</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.570" end="00:44:07.140" style="s2">whatever entering the body if you look</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.060" end="00:44:10.080" style="s2">at white blood cells</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.140" end="00:44:12.120" style="s2">you know they will chase a bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.080" end="00:44:13.890" style="s2">until if got it you know and eat it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.120" end="00:44:14.940" style="s2">they&#39;ve got this real track now if your</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.890" end="00:44:17.640" style="s2">pants I kissed you will believe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.940" end="00:44:19.320" style="s2">those cells have got their own sentience</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.640" end="00:44:21.890" style="s2">their own wills and I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.320" end="00:44:24.510" style="s2">for logical reasons they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.890" end="00:44:25.980" style="s2">although they&#39;ve got this it seems at</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.510" end="00:44:28.470" style="s2">least the strong drive to eat this</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.980" end="00:44:30.180" style="s2">bacterium they don&#39;t know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.470" end="00:44:31.860" style="s2">actually acting on behalf of the greater</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.180" end="00:44:33.510" style="s2">organism you know I don&#39;t believe they</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.860" end="00:44:35.070" style="s2">have got this consciousness and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.510" end="00:44:37.170" style="s2">is the same on us humans you know we</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.070" end="00:44:40.620" style="s2">have certain drives which actually are</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.170" end="00:44:42.630" style="s2">for our drives honor on a higher level a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.620" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">higher whole on ik level of which we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.630" end="00:44:48.750" style="s2">not conscious but that&#39;s irrelevant we</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:50.910" style="s2">still are moved by them and you know one</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.750" end="00:44:52.680" style="s2">does you know I do have sympathy for</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.910" end="00:44:54.750" style="s2">that but it can only ever be speculative</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.680" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">I believe unless there are some other</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.750" end="00:44:58.080" style="s2">good reasons for believing it which</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">would make sense of something else down</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.080" end="00:45:01.530" style="s2">the line this is something I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.300" style="s2">really looked into but I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.530" end="00:45:05.130" style="s2">most people believe it I mean oK you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.300" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">got the collective unconscious of young</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.130" end="00:45:09.630" style="s2">but also you&#39;ve got just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:11.700" style="s2">evolution right like neo-darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.630" end="00:45:14.430" style="s2">Darwinian evolution even you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.700" end="00:45:16.170" style="s2">sexual impulse right you know your</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.430" end="00:45:19.590" style="s2">attraction to a woman or a man or</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.170" end="00:45:22.920" style="s2">whatever not goats to another human</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.590" end="00:45:24.660" style="s2">let&#39;s say is you don&#39;t consciously think</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.920" end="00:45:25.980" style="s2">I&#39;m going to ant to the survival of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.660" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2">species right</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.980" end="00:45:29.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not your motive of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:30.990" style="s2">not you just think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.100" end="00:45:34.500" style="s2">whatever it in the flesh but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.990" end="00:45:37.020" style="s2">it seems that we have that lower motive</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.500" end="00:45:38.820" style="s2">due to a higher motive so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.020" end="00:45:41.070" style="s2">lower conscious motive but that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.820" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">part and parcel of a broader higher one</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.070" end="00:45:44.130" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think I think you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.140" end="00:45:46.050" style="s2">be hard-pressed to find someone who</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.130" end="00:45:47.670" style="s2">denied that so in in like in like</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.050" end="00:45:49.320" style="s2">fashion there might be other drives</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.670" end="00:45:51.060" style="s2">apart from sexual drive that we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.320" end="00:45:52.650" style="s2">which are part of a larger one of which</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.060" end="00:45:54.210" style="s2">we are unconscious yeah that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.650" end="00:45:55.260" style="s2">really well put I think there is a real</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.210" end="00:45:56.700" style="s2">bridge between what we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.260" end="00:45:58.890" style="s2">because I can totally get on board with</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.700" end="00:46:00.690" style="s2">where we currently sit there is no</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.890" end="00:46:02.460" style="s2">innocence there&#39;s no proof for it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.690" end="00:46:03.720" style="s2">why is a vulnerability and stepping out</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.460" end="00:46:04.680" style="s2">and embodying this value</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.720" end="00:46:06.780" style="s2">structure and you seem to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.680" end="00:46:08.280" style="s2">similar one yeah but what&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.780" end="00:46:09.930" style="s2">important is this you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:11.490" style="s2">distinguish metaphysics from science and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.930" end="00:46:13.710" style="s2">not my metaphysics are handmade them</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.490" end="00:46:15.210" style="s2">science you know science can cut well</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.710" end="00:46:17.010" style="s2">like I said can&#39;t get a proofs anyway if</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.210" end="00:46:19.020" style="s2">you believe in falsification ISM you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.010" end="00:46:20.490" style="s2">own to where proofs and maths and logic</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:22.859" style="s2">and even that then the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.490" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">reality is very questionable right so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.859" end="00:46:28.140" style="s2">have to realize that our knowledge has</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:30.750" style="s2">to go beyond proof because if you only</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.140" end="00:46:32.670" style="s2">relied on proof you&#39;re very limited in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.750" end="00:46:35.130" style="s2">what you could know like some you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.670" end="00:46:38.040" style="s2">axioms of logic math some equations and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.130" end="00:46:39.660" style="s2">you know the cogito I think therefore n</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.040" end="00:46:41.369" style="s2">perhaps yeah and that&#39;s it you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.660" end="00:46:42.540" style="s2">even know other people are conscious you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.369" end="00:46:43.980" style="s2">know these are inferences these you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.540" end="00:46:46.380" style="s2">can&#39;t prove another person&#39;s conscience</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.980" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">even by near occurrence of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.380" end="00:46:50.820" style="s2">a baby still it&#39;s still an inference to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:53.000" style="s2">an extent so um yeah you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.820" end="00:46:55.619" style="s2">understand metaphysics is a another</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.000" end="00:46:56.820" style="s2">means of acquiring knowledge but their</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.619" end="00:46:59.010" style="s2">knowledge is not proof knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.820" end="00:47:00.750" style="s2">something else yeah and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.010" end="00:47:03.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the room to speculate and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.750" end="00:47:06.060" style="s2">obviously some speculations are valid or</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.660" end="00:47:07.980" style="s2">true and others or not so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.060" end="00:47:11.250" style="s2">to think about well what arguments could</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.980" end="00:47:14.010" style="s2">you use in its favor right but we humans</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.250" end="00:47:17.339" style="s2">are not you know we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.010" end="00:47:19.230" style="s2">capability of omniscience right what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.339" end="00:47:21.510" style="s2">do have the capability of is striding</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.230" end="00:47:23.609" style="s2">out into the forest striding out into</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:26.849" style="s2">the unknown and hopefully coming back</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.609" end="00:47:28.650" style="s2">and what that sort of well I had a mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.849" end="00:47:29.810" style="s2">to bring in psychedelics a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.650" end="00:47:32.460" style="s2">here because it struck me that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.810" end="00:47:34.770" style="s2">psychedelics are a tool that sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.460" end="00:47:38.010" style="s2">can be used in a short doses to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.770" end="00:47:40.380" style="s2">go go between these sort of levels</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.010" end="00:47:42.150" style="s2">yes feel the higher level but then also</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.380" end="00:47:44.849" style="s2">you reckon might recognize how an</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.150" end="00:47:48.599" style="s2">effective pull of of seduction might</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.849" end="00:47:51.000" style="s2">relate to you the the larger entity so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.599" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">interestingly so if there are these</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.000" end="00:47:57.740" style="s2">higher Holland&#39;s right or systems of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.990" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">teleology that move one like perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.740" end="00:48:02.099" style="s2">galaxies that move the solar system in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:03.990" style="s2">very subtle way and thus you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.099" end="00:48:05.880" style="s2">although we&#39;re not generally conscious</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.990" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">of it could we acquire consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.880" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">it by dismissing our normal</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:11.730" style="s2">physiological functioning possibly is</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">the interesting thing and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.730" end="00:48:15.089" style="s2">of reports which seem to corroborate</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:17.220" style="s2">that so for example when we talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.089" end="00:48:19.410" style="s2">about rhythm a durational Bergson is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.220" end="00:48:22.230" style="s2">yes sir no psychedelics you can see time</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.410" end="00:48:24.359" style="s2">slowing down or speeding up in other</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.230" end="00:48:26.760" style="s2">words we lose that speed of time that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.359" end="00:48:28.950" style="s2">have and thus we gain sympathy with</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.760" end="00:48:31.080" style="s2">other life forms lower than us perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.950" end="00:48:33.570" style="s2">but also yeah exactly higher with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.080" end="00:48:36.510" style="s2">higher than us perhaps you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.570" end="00:48:38.520" style="s2">very very common to experience unity</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.510" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">with everything you know so perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.520" end="00:48:43.560" style="s2">then is rejecting our individual our</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">individualism and then entering that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.560" end="00:48:48.510" style="s2">larger hole on which has that greater to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:50.220" style="s2">Allah gee perhaps or no to you but again</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.510" end="00:48:52.710" style="s2">you know the interesting thing is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.220" end="00:48:54.630" style="s2">you feel it but what kind of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:56.460" style="s2">does that give you yeah I mean William</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:48:58.560" style="s2">James as you know spoke Latin the noetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.460" end="00:48:59.790" style="s2">quality of mystical States in other</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.560" end="00:49:01.950" style="s2">words when you&#39;re there you just know</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.790" end="00:49:03.810" style="s2">it&#39;s real but of course after that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.950" end="00:49:06.180" style="s2">might doubt yourself oh yeah because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.810" end="00:49:07.650" style="s2">lose the noetic no exorcism but you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.180" end="00:49:08.820" style="s2">it seems that the notok quality is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.650" end="00:49:10.560" style="s2">talking about something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.820" end="00:49:13.050" style="s2">you know that one plus one is two or you</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.560" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">know modus ponens modus tollens must be</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:17.130" style="s2">true you know modus ponens is logical</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">axiom that you know if P then Q P</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.130" end="00:49:20.760" style="s2">therefore cute right you know it has</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:22.230" style="s2">Falls but if I ask you why everyone be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.760" end="00:49:23.849" style="s2">very hard-pressed to to give a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.230" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">justification but you know it you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.849" end="00:49:27.510" style="s2">know it and that seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">intuition even at that on the basic</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.510" end="00:49:31.800" style="s2">level of logic and maths and whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:33.270" style="s2">although I I don&#39;t think I personally</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.800" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2">have ever really had this but William</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.270" end="00:49:36.810" style="s2">James certainly talks about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.440" end="00:49:38.520" style="s2">common theme in mystical States which</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.810" end="00:49:40.020" style="s2">you could equate with psychedelic States</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.520" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s this sort of noetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.020" end="00:49:44.550" style="s2">knowledge in the psychedelic state which</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">is equivalent to that logical one</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.550" end="00:49:48.930" style="s2">so therefore isn&#39;t that as valid a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.550" style="s2">knowledge you know well basically you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.930" end="00:49:51.890" style="s2">can&#39;t know if you unless you&#39;re in it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.550" end="00:49:54.359" style="s2">yourself yeah I mean there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.890" end="00:49:56.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s why metaphysics has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.359" end="00:49:57.900" style="s2">brought to bear upon these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.130" end="00:50:00.030" style="s2">rather than simply just science or</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.900" end="00:50:02.130" style="s2">psychology or psychology as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.030" end="00:50:04.710" style="s2">today you know quantitative ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.130" end="00:50:06.839" style="s2">certainly the living of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.710" end="00:50:08.520" style="s2">certainly the experiencing of it and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.839" end="00:50:10.890" style="s2">changes what yeah I mean the living of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.520" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">it but for me it&#39;s made me appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.890" end="00:50:16.470" style="s2">nature much more than I did</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:18.540" style="s2">and in fact really I remember writing</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.470" end="00:50:21.570" style="s2">after my first one of my first trips</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.540" end="00:50:25.109" style="s2">like just got this massive appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.570" end="00:50:28.050" style="s2">for art paintings nature theology even</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.109" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">you know it just somehow riches your</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.050" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">interest in things so it&#39;s a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:33.330" style="s2">tool for</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:35.460" style="s2">for certain people yeah well pizza I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.330" end="00:50:37.740" style="s2">could and we&#39;ll talk to you for many</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.460" end="00:50:39.900" style="s2">more hours to come but I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.740" end="00:50:42.300" style="s2">seen we seem to have arrived at a nice</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.900" end="00:50:43.890" style="s2">nice place of closure here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.300" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">it is there anything you want to say to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.890" end="00:50:47.670" style="s2">people listening about where they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:50.100" style="s2">get in contact with you or what they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.670" end="00:50:51.660" style="s2">read further of your work okay so well</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.100" end="00:50:54.510" style="s2">my book is called númenor ticks as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.660" end="00:50:55.890" style="s2">mentioned it&#39;s available from Amazon but</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.510" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">better to buy it from psychedelic press</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.890" end="00:51:01.830" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:04.170" style="s2">my website is philosopher EU I&#39;ve got a</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.170" end="00:51:07.890" style="s2">sticks you make frequent updates on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.360" end="00:51:09.180" style="s2">it&#39;s actually pretty good I recommend I</p>
