<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">and It&#39;s very nice, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">to have the opportunity to speak with you again, and thanks very much for making the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.760" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">Thank You Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.470" end="00:02:05.429" style="s2">PETERSON: So, can I ask you it&#39;s been about a year since we talked last I guess I&#39;d like to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.950" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">First of all, personally, what&#39;s this year been like for you? You&#39;ve become a much more controversial figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:14.590" style="s2">I would say than</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.590" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">would really be predicted but</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.190" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve always seemed to me to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.950" end="00:02:22.660" style="s2">solid reliable</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.660" end="00:02:24.099" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.099" end="00:02:29.399" style="s2">mainstream scientists not someone who would attract a tremendous amount of critical</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">Attention and yet you&#39;ve become well oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.500" end="00:02:42.419" style="s2">associated with the intellectual dark web what ever that happens to be and so much of what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">controversial and so, what&#39;s that being like and what&#39;s your life be like over the last while</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.940" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t think that a defensive reason science humanism and progress would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.280" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">incendiary and I&#39;m hardly a flame thrower and.. and as you note</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">I have put forward some pretty controversial ideas in the past such as that.. uh.. men and women aren&#39;t indistinguishable</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.860" end="00:03:09.500" style="s2">and that we all Harbor some unsavory motives like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:15.380" style="s2">Revenge and dominance but saying the world has gotten better turns out to be a radical</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.240" end="00:03:18.240" style="s2">inflammatory hypothesis there... uh...</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:24.440" style="s2">there are there&#39;s first of all just sheer incredulity because the you of the world that you get from</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">Journalism is so different from the view of the world when you get from data because journalism reports everything that goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:35.609" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t report things that go right, and so if they&#39;re more things that go right every year. There&#39;s just no way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:43.739" style="s2">Learning about it if you know the world from the papers and so there&#39;s just sheer disbelief. I&#39;m talking about there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.500" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">intellectual factions that are committed to the idea that the world has never been worse than it is now and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.800" end="00:03:53.219" style="s2">data on human progress undermines</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.890" end="00:03:58.230" style="s2">Some of their their foundational beliefs and then so that does attract</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.920" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">some some opposition people think of it as a defense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">neoliberal capitalism or a defense of the opposite, secular humanism</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.960" end="00:04:15.700" style="s2">Traditional liberalism and so does get some people exorcised</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:24.959" style="s2">Basically anyone if you&#39;re a social critic if your reputation comes on saying what&#39;s going wrong about the current society.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:26.890" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.890" end="00:04:32.369" style="s2">You&#39;re kind of committed to the idea that things have gotten gotten worse and the idea that things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.860" end="00:04:37.470" style="s2">Not as bad as they used to be not as bad as they could be is an insult to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.350" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">those core beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:46.279" style="s2">Yeah, well, it&#39;s it&#39;s a surprising thing because well and so so let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:48.679" style="s2">I mean, here&#39;s some of the things I know,</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.290" end="00:04:51.290" style="s2">I think I know and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">Maybe you could describe some of the things, you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">And like I started learning that the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:03.619" style="s2">had been improving when I worked for a UN committee about five years ago now and started looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.200" end="00:05:06.200" style="s2">data on</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:11.810" style="s2">Ecology and sustainable economic development and that&#39;s like there&#39;s some bad ecological news</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.810" end="00:05:14.750" style="s2">I think that what we&#39;re doing to the oceans is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.690" end="00:05:22.429" style="s2">Fundamentally unforgivable and and foolish beyond belief, but there&#39;s some ecological news. That&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">Surprising positivity like there is a paper published in Nature not so long ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.850" end="00:05:35.450" style="s2">Stating for example that an area twice the size of the US has greened in the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.610" end="00:05:43.100" style="s2">15 years think it was last 15 or 20 years that actually happened to be as a consequence of increased carbon dioxide because</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.470" end="00:05:50.119" style="s2">Plants can keep their pores closed if there&#39;s more carbon dioxide and so they can live in more</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.340" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">semi-arid areas and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:58.399" style="s2">There&#39;s more forests in the northern hemisphere than there were a hundred years ago and more forests in India and China</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.530" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">Than there were 30 years ago. And then this has gone along with it massively improved stan... standard of living</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.930" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">The child mortality rate in Africa is now the same as it was in Europe in 1952, which is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:16.520" style="s2">statistic that I just regard is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.160" end="00:06:19.160" style="s2">absolutely miraculous, the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">African economies are growing, sub-saharan African economies seem to be growing faster at the moment if the stats are reliable then</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.479" end="00:06:29.479" style="s2">economies anywhere else in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:36.140" style="s2">Partly because the Africans are getting connected electronically and have access to reasonable information into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.700" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">Approximating let&#39;s say stable currency</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.500" end="00:06:42.740" style="s2">alternatives, um...</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.140" end="00:06:49.789" style="s2">There... there&#39;s people are the rate of poverty is diminishing at an amazing rate</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:52.070" style="s2">Right, we have poverty</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:59.479" style="s2">Considering it at a dollar ninety a day between 2000 and 2012 and I&#39;ve read criticisms of that saying well</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.479" end="00:07:02.089" style="s2">that was an arbitrary number, but if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.789" end="00:07:04.789" style="s2">$3.80 a day</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">You see the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:09.169" style="s2">Decline if you look at $7.60 a day</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.169" end="00:07:15.860" style="s2">You see the same decline not as precipitous and even the UN not known I would say for its optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.040" end="00:07:23.420" style="s2">Prognostications estimates that at this rate by the year 2030 there won&#39;t be anyone in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.420" end="00:07:27.320" style="s2">Who&#39;s living below the current poverty level? So...</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.860" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">so there are some positive statistics so</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.500" end="00:07:34.100" style="s2">What... what... what... what would you like to add to that?</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:42.019" style="s2">Oh yes, and those are all of those those numbers are reported in graphs in enlightenment now, but also what else?</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">Illiteracy is declining</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.630" end="00:07:47.630" style="s2">rates of uh... of uh...</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.639" end="00:07:52.489" style="s2">Violent crime including violence against women and children are declining, child labor is declining</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:58.249" style="s2">Death and warfare is declining how people have more leisure time. They have more access to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.919" end="00:08:01.728" style="s2">small luxuries like ear and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">Reporting on plane fare, so it&#39;s funny that that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.120" end="00:08:18.859" style="s2">Examples of human progress which one would think indicate the attempt to make the world a better place? It&#39;s not just do-gooding</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.860" end="00:08:26.570" style="s2">It&#39;s not romantic. It&#39;s not utopian. We really can improve the world if we set our minds to do it should-should around so much anger</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">Partly because they people are so unused to thinking that things have gotten better, but they confuse it with</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.610" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">Certain kinds of magical thinking such as...</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.250" end="00:08:42.799" style="s2">that things.. that this must mean that there is a force in the universe that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:50.089" style="s2">Carries us ever upward that just makes progress happen by itself, which is the exact opposite to reality the universe</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.089" end="00:08:57.049" style="s2">Not only doesn&#39;t care about us. But as a number of features that are constantly pushing back at us like like like entropy like</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.170" end="00:09:00.170" style="s2">like pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.810" end="00:09:02.810" style="s2">Entropies a bad one</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">Entry entropy is is the is the root of all human suffering</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.360" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">So here this doesn&#39;t care about us</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.570" end="00:09:18.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve read to other things that are peculiar that are so interesting and well, okay, so first of all, um,</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.820" end="00:09:24.010" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty hard on the Marxists. I would say because</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">Even though there is inequality and inequality is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.260" end="00:09:31.260" style="s2">first of all, it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:37.820" style="s2">Inequality can be placed at the feet of capitalism. It seems to me to be a far more intractable problem than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.860" end="00:09:46.200" style="s2">second it&#39;s clear that the poor are getting richer despite the fact of inequality and third and this is hard on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.700" end="00:09:49.779" style="s2">environmentalists I think is that it turns out that if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.209" end="00:09:55.899" style="s2">Get people&#39;s income up to about five thousand dollars a year in terms of gross domestic product</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.899" end="00:09:58.419" style="s2">They actually start to care about the environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.060" end="00:10:01.959" style="s2">Which I suppose is because they&#39;re not worried about dying</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.269" end="00:10:07.389" style="s2">Instantly that day or that week and so we seem to be in this perverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">situation for a pessimist where</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.519" end="00:10:12.519" style="s2">We could make people</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.829" end="00:10:14.829" style="s2">wealthy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:17.109" style="s2">in in a positive manner and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.050" end="00:10:24.700" style="s2">We could make the world a better place simultaneously and that does seem to be very hard on</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.250" end="00:10:26.990" style="s2">ideologue whose</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.990" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">ideology is predicated on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:36.790" style="s2">Fundamental pessimism where you get the other people like the biologists do this sometimes and say well, yeah, we&#39;re purchasing all this short-term</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.370" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.389" style="s2">you know for these billions of people but at the cost of some medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.060" end="00:10:46.089" style="s2">eventual precipitous, you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.060" end="00:10:53.229" style="s2">apocalyptic collapse and it&#39;s very difficult to formulate an argument against that kind of idea because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.870" end="00:11:00.579" style="s2">Well, you never know when some yeah, I think this is one of the thing tell him takes you to task for doesn&#39;t he?</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:04.539" style="s2">Yes, I even though I actually have pretty extensive</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.060" end="00:11:11.080" style="s2">coverage of the tail risks both in the better angels of our nature and in enlightenment now</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:15.020" style="s2">and and indeed we do we cannot take</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">incremental improvement as itself an indication that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">Risk of catastrophe is at an acceptable level it may not be uh...</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.540" end="00:13:51.709" style="s2">I was I was shocked when I started to learn about this the fact that there was so much good both</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.140" end="00:15:29.150" style="s2">There&#39;s a graph that I think human progress dot org put out</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.810" end="00:15:44.929" style="s2">But it&#39;s what they call the most miraculous most important graph in the world and shows this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.660" end="00:15:47.010" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.010" end="00:15:52.489" style="s2">Acceleration if you prosperity basically kicking in exponentially around 1895</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.129" end="00:15:58.699" style="s2">and yes a little bit earlier, but this is a combination of data sources including the</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.139" end="00:16:19.938" style="s2">It is astonishing and I&#39;ve got to say when I first saw that curve when I was working on better angels of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.939" end="00:16:24.139" style="s2">I was stunned. I mean this is the original hockey stick. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.259" end="00:16:32.809" style="s2">Till the Industrial Revolution and then then it shoots up exponentially wait</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.389" end="00:16:36.559" style="s2">so, you know, I look at that and I think well look I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">What&#39;s the issue here</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:45.769" style="s2">We still have inequality but you can&#39;t put it at the feet of capitalism because it seems to be a much more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.290" end="00:16:49.490" style="s2">Mechanism will ease poverty. Certainly. Yes. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.069" end="00:16:55.938" style="s2">well, and even inequality, I mean that there seems to be this proclivity towards the unequal distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.699" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">phenomena, not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.459" end="00:17:03.198" style="s2">monetary phenomena, but I mean if you look at virtually every</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:05.309" style="s2">domain of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.309" end="00:17:11.119" style="s2">Endeavor that&#39;s associated with creativity you get a preeto distribution of productivity, you know</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.669" end="00:17:32.239" style="s2">Mean, I&#39;m not trying to make a case that inequality</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:33.830" style="s2">Isn&#39;t a problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.830" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to make a case that it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.909" end="00:17:42.109" style="s2">Deeper problem than the Marxists presume and then you have the other problem that well the poor keep getting richer</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.110" end="00:17:48.890" style="s2">I mean half the world is middle class now and obesity is a bigger problem than starvation. And so</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.590" end="00:17:53.179" style="s2">When I&#39;m talking I can&#39;t I&#39;m really having a hard time</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.799" end="00:18:09.569" style="s2">yes, so part of it is that their foil is a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.059" end="00:18:16.229" style="s2">Objectivism in which you have a pure</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:29.699" style="s2">now one of the discoveries that I made which was almost as surprising as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.159" end="00:18:33.629" style="s2">Hockey stick graph of prosperity the fact that in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">Every developed country every rich country</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:42.959" style="s2">I went on a screen of social spending and so that from a baseline about</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.450" end="00:18:49.890" style="s2">1.5 percent of GDP redistributed to children and the poor and the elderly and the sick now the</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.059" end="00:19:01.319" style="s2">And all which countries are in a band from about 20% of GDP to about 30% of GDP</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:03.719" style="s2">I have the United States is at the low end</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.510" end="00:19:10.109" style="s2">Actually Canada to my surprise our home and native land is actually a bit lower than the United States. I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:15.929" style="s2">Even know Canada it would appear to have a more generous welfare state than the United States</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.929" end="00:19:16.529" style="s2">and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.529" end="00:19:24.089" style="s2">The United States would be even higher if you added all of the socialism that is done through employers like retirement and health insurance</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.399" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">which in other countries is done through the government, but even if we just looked at government redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.169" end="00:19:35.398" style="s2">It just does not exist a wealthy country without a an extensive social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.850" end="00:19:42.779" style="s2">Here&#39;s the theory you tell me what you think about this. So I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:48.779" style="s2">Let&#39;s say steel man, the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.440" end="00:19:52.830" style="s2">Positions of the left. I don&#39;t mean the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.830" end="00:19:59.309" style="s2">I mean the moderate left because I believe that the dialogue between the moderate left in the moderate right is what keeps our</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.179" end="00:20:04.499" style="s2">stabilized essentially and for this reason so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.590" end="00:20:07.590" style="s2">People have to group together</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.679" end="00:20:15.719" style="s2">Cooperative cooperatively and competitively to solve difficult problems because we have difficult prob. That&#39;s entropy</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:21.389" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and and the assault of the natural world. So we have to group together when we do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.389" end="00:20:26.339" style="s2">We create hierarchies and we do that in large part. We hope by</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.070" end="00:20:33.480" style="s2">elevating those who the most competent at solving the problems to the higher positions in the hierarchies now that can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.909" end="00:20:41.549" style="s2">contaminated by power and tyranny and crookedness and poor selection and all of that poor measurement but fundamentally if your</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.980" end="00:20:46.409" style="s2">Hierarchy is functional the more competent people rise to the top. No</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.929" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:50.758" style="s2">produces the advantage of solving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.460" end="00:20:57.359" style="s2">But it produces the disadvantage of making a lot of people stack up at the bottom of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.639" end="00:21:03.029" style="s2">hierarchy because that&#39;s what tends to happen because of the Credo distribution and and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.330" end="00:21:09.539" style="s2">Built-in proclivity for inequality. So the answer to that seems to be well</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.539" end="00:21:15.329" style="s2">we produce the hierarchies we accept the inequality, but then we attend with some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.269" end="00:21:19.108" style="s2">clarity of vision and care to those who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.659" end="00:21:25.799" style="s2">dispossessed by the necessity of the hierarchies and your claim seems to be from what you just said is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:32.460" style="s2">essentially what we&#39;ve been doing in civilized democracies for the last hundred years and that that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.249" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">roughly working</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:40.259" style="s2">Well it is. Yes, that&#39;s right. Now whether or not the hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.710" end="00:21:44.549" style="s2">optimal in the sense that we&#39;re better off with the hierarchy because</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.249" end="00:21:47.579" style="s2">of just what will happen in a</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.940" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">There are a number of reasons why every wealthy country has a social safety net and why as countries get richer</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.420" end="00:22:51.239" style="s2">like Brazil and India and China, they turn their attention to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.030" end="00:22:54.030" style="s2">more social welfare</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.150" end="00:23:02.790" style="s2">The the the European and North American societies did it in the 20th century and the developing world is following suit partly</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.790" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">It&#39;s because some of the investment in some of the redistribution is investment. It&#39;s a public good</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:09.060" style="s2">It&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.060" end="00:23:14.669" style="s2">If the entire population is educated or everyone including the people who are hiring them</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.160" end="00:23:18.060" style="s2">And so some of it is just investment in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.740" end="00:23:26.430" style="s2">One take on the Marxist position because funny thing is is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.430" end="00:23:28.979" style="s2">You lived in Montreal. I lived in Montreal</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.830" end="00:23:31.420" style="s2">Montreal is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.420" end="00:23:32.860" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.860" end="00:23:37.979" style="s2">flat city in some sense in terms of its economic distribution like there are no pockets of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.710" end="00:23:44.879" style="s2">terrifying poverty at least on the island and it&#39;s a very safe place and and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.280" end="00:23:50.700" style="s2">Socially rich in some sense. Like I always felt wealthy when I lived in Montreal even though I was living on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.030" end="00:23:54.030" style="s2">hd&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.000" end="00:24:01.170" style="s2">Stipend which was very in the area the area we used to call the Stephen get home. Yeah, the sound luxury condominiums</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.170" end="00:24:06.599" style="s2">What was so lovely about Montreal was that it was safe</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.330" end="00:24:13.859" style="s2">It was beautiful and it had an unbelievably vibrant public culture. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.680" end="00:24:16.889" style="s2">there was all a consequence of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.560" end="00:24:19.030" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.030" end="00:24:26.009" style="s2">Generally speaking were well enough off. And so, you know, if you contrast that with a country like Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:33.810" style="s2">Where a tiny minority of people have all the wealth? Well, they&#39;re stuck with the problem of living in gilded prisons</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.810" end="00:24:40.919" style="s2">They have to move their children around in helicopters. And like I think one of the things that people realize as</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.059" end="00:24:46.798" style="s2">he&#39;s become richer is that it&#39;s better to calculate your wealth on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.229" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">broader level to include more people within the purview of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.399" end="00:24:55.738" style="s2">Constitutes wealth for you because it&#39;s so nice to be in a city. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:24:58.239" style="s2">thriving and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.239" end="00:25:05.459" style="s2">healthy and and and not crime ridden and resentful and and those need to be factored in there&#39;s elements of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:06.940" style="s2">individual wealth</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.940" end="00:25:08.940" style="s2">That&#39;s right. And there is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.549" end="00:25:17.098" style="s2">Debate among the social scientists as to whether it is inequality that drives these other social goods such as low crime</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.589" end="00:25:19.149" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.149" end="00:25:22.498" style="s2">Investment such as education or whether it&#39;s prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.499" end="00:25:29.098" style="s2">It&#39;s not so easy to tell them apart because in general poorer countries like South Africa and Brazil have sky-high</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.589" end="00:25:35.489" style="s2">Inequality countries like Norway and Sweden and Switzerland, which have less inequality are also pretty rich</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:43.499" style="s2">And it isn&#39;t so easy to see which one is driving it because as societies get richer as we&#39;ve discussed</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.019" end="00:25:47.159" style="s2">they tend to redistribute partly out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.129" end="00:25:49.779" style="s2">investing in a public good</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.779" end="00:25:51.129" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.129" end="00:25:56.338" style="s2">Will a crime such as having an educated populace is just a really good thing hardly</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.339" end="00:25:59.879" style="s2">It is literally insurance and the euphemism social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.099" end="00:26:01.830" style="s2">That is something that captures to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.830" end="00:26:09.509" style="s2">if you fall actors the idea that even when people are well-off they worry that they&#39;re there but for a fortune goai that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.999" end="00:26:15.059" style="s2">You got to be nice to people on the way up because you might need them on the way down. And so putting a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.940" end="00:26:23.940" style="s2">bottom floor on how poor you can be makes everyone feel a little more secure that if the worst thing happened they will not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.940" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">Destitute. Yes. Well, so that&#39;s a second thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">It&#39;s not that uncommon for people who are in the top 10% say of the economic distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:36.609" style="s2">Or even in the top 1%</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.609" end="00:26:38.609" style="s2">to suffer a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.009" end="00:26:46.289" style="s2">reversal of fortune at some point in their life and it&#39;s a very rare person a very very rare person who isn&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.769" end="00:26:52.829" style="s2">Economic danger of economic disadvantage at some point in their life for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.080" end="00:26:58.149" style="s2">Well, certainly people move in and out the top decile top 10% of the income distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.940" end="00:27:05.739" style="s2">Although this argument fool or social spending would be to indemnify people against the worst outcome</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.739" end="00:27:10.539" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that many people in the top tenth or to say nothing of the top 1% will ever go on welfare</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.849" end="00:27:15.369" style="s2">but still a lot of people in the middle class can imagine it and they don&#39;t want to think that they&#39;ll be out on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.369" end="00:27:16.429" style="s2">streets</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.429" end="00:27:21.878" style="s2">their job or fans of us suddenly suffer a big, you know medical expense and the third reason after</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.820" end="00:27:28.179" style="s2">investment and insurance is just a compassion or empathy we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.820" end="00:27:34.570" style="s2">history of the West after the Industrial Revolution you get a literature of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.239" end="00:27:37.959" style="s2">of compassion or war you you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.419" end="00:27:45.189" style="s2">The little MatchGirl you have magnesia table and know about wrong being in prison for stealing a bit of bread to say this</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.409" end="00:28:02.409" style="s2">with their computers their fellow-citizens</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.379" end="00:28:07.598" style="s2">that&#39;s another reason why the people who are criticizing your</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.139" end="00:28:16.238" style="s2">Informed optimism are irritated because you know, if your fundamental political doctrine insists that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.849" end="00:28:18.049" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.049" end="00:28:25.028" style="s2">Everything your primary identity is your group whatever that happens to be and the primary</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.710" end="00:28:32.679" style="s2">Motivating factor for the function of your group is raw naked power</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.499" end="00:28:39.819" style="s2">Played out within that group against all other groups the introduction of something like the notion of an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.429" end="00:28:42.518" style="s2">compassion for the downtrodden</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.099" end="00:28:48.069" style="s2">Seems to like wreak havoc with the purity of that ideological position</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.070" end="00:28:53.019" style="s2">But like I&#39;ve never met anyone in my life, and I know one a large number of extraordinarily</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.849" end="00:29:08.769" style="s2">Who&#39;s clearly suffering terribly as a consequence of dwelling on the street?</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:10.670" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.670" end="00:29:13.090" style="s2">what would you say celebrate the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.640" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">Justice of the universe in elevating them above that person who&#39;s suffering</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:21.670" style="s2">I mean, I think well</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.000" end="00:29:26.740" style="s2">Go ahead. I mean we do know from from social psychology that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.410" end="00:29:29.090" style="s2">tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.090" end="00:29:34.840" style="s2">To to blame the victim to believe that you know in a just world. So I think those are two</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.170" end="00:29:41.769" style="s2">motives that we have compassion for everyone but also feeling that that those who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.110" end="00:29:44.199" style="s2">badly off must have done something to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.870" end="00:29:45.880" style="s2">To deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.880" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">We do see this of course in the app service that you and I usually attention because of course the attention I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.260" end="00:29:56.260" style="s2">It&#39;s also modulated by</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:29:58.510" style="s2">by some degree of ethnic solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.000" end="00:30:03.610" style="s2">There&#39;s been noted that some of the generous welfare states of europe have least historically</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.820" end="00:30:13.929" style="s2">I certainly racially more homogeneous than the United States which tends to be a somewhat stingy. ER now</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.930" end="00:30:20.019" style="s2">this is not a if there is some elasticity into what we call beautifully categorized as our group and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.390" end="00:30:23.800" style="s2">one of the great achievements of any kind of nation-building is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.350" end="00:30:29.499" style="s2">Is to instill a feeling well, we&#39;re all Canadians or we&#39;re all Swiss or a lot</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:42.100" style="s2">Nation, then people tend not to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.650" end="00:30:44.650" style="s2">including you in ways of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.050" end="00:30:47.889" style="s2">providing social welfare for the worst half</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.370" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">It&#39;s a ridiculously interesting point I would say because one of the things that you really see in Canada, for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.780" end="00:31:03.280" style="s2">And our Prime Minister is a real devotee of this idea is that there really is? No Canadian culture?</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.280" end="00:31:08.019" style="s2">There&#39;s no central Canadian ethos. And what we have is a plurality of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:16.360" style="s2">Multicultural microcosms and that that&#39;s actually all for the best. No, I guess the Canadian mosaic as opposed to the melting pot isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.030" end="00:31:21.009" style="s2">Right. All right, the Prime Minister&#39;s father Pierre Elliott Trudeau</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.650" end="00:31:25.389" style="s2">Famously tried to forge kind of Canadian identity that spanned</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:48.820" style="s2">We all felt now</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.960" end="00:32:36.340" style="s2">maybe you could tell me what you think about this in the in a certain element of leftist doctrine because</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">Multiculturalism is can be reasonably viewed as part of the leftist doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.690" end="00:32:48.340" style="s2">If it is the case that people are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.620" end="00:32:53.259" style="s2">Generous to those that they see in some sense as their in-group</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:58.360" style="s2">Then what it suggests is that you need to take the the mosaic of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.210" end="00:33:01.210" style="s2">your culture the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:07.960" style="s2">African Canadians and the European Canadians and the Asian Canadians the same in the US and</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.910" end="00:33:26.980" style="s2">that constitutes the national identity that unites them all despite their differences and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">Seems like given what you just described that unless you can</p>

<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:54.809" style="s2">Coming out of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.809" end="00:33:59.149" style="s2">Opposed by the counter enlightenment of the 19th century by the romantics</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.150" end="00:34:03.769" style="s2">I mean the nationalists that be that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.920" end="00:34:06.120" style="s2">state a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.120" end="00:34:09.439" style="s2">Group of people under the jurisdiction of a government but held together</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.659" end="00:34:13.189" style="s2">Basically by a social contract by agreement that we&#39;re all in this together</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">there are many public goods W better we share public costs that we can suffer a government that</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.020" end="00:34:26.719" style="s2">Get along by serving in our interests is way of improving our welfare</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.820" end="00:34:31.879" style="s2">it&#39;s a very given conception of a nation and the blood and soil nationalism of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.580" end="00:34:38.059" style="s2">19th century continuing well into the 20th, but what makes us a nation is that we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.750" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">Same ancestry and that the successful nations are often ones that manage to forge. The somewhat artificial identity is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.179" end="00:34:55.819" style="s2">Fascinating because then ok, then then we got two arguments here for that for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.630" end="00:35:01.640" style="s2">Let&#39;s say artificial or conceptual nation-building</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">process one is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:12.050" style="s2">maybe you can allow people in their different ethnic and racial groups to maintain key elements of their identity and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:20.540" style="s2">And and feel comfortable doing so but also embed them in a broader game like a game voluntary played and laid out</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.000" end="00:35:23.479" style="s2">But if exactly are the same token</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.030" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">Given your logic that&#39;s also the most effective antidote to the kind of nationalism. That is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:34.700" style="s2">identitarian that also seems to be in the resurgence and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.220" end="00:35:39.530" style="s2">You see this. I really see this as having been done extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.050" end="00:35:47.149" style="s2">effectively in the United States now, they had the advantage of the examples of England and France, but that the American</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:51.559" style="s2">experiment was an experiment in conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.739" end="00:36:00.289" style="s2">Nation-building. It&#39;s like here&#39;s a creative principles that we can all agree on despite our differences and to the degree that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.289" end="00:36:07.849" style="s2">decide that we will agree on these principles then were the same enough we can cooperate we don&#39;t need to revert to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.430" end="00:36:14.690" style="s2">Nationalism or or very much in in the Declaration of Independence. That was made crystal clear that to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.299" end="00:36:17.299" style="s2">life liberty and pursuit of happiness</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">Governments are formed with the consent of the governed to allow people to to flourish to prosper</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.299" end="00:36:31.699" style="s2">It was really a social contract</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.700" end="00:36:38.869" style="s2">I setup from first principles, which of course made some pretty big problems with of course. We are the African citizens</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.869" end="00:36:45.558" style="s2">it took quite a while to work that out and there were tensions in the 20th century with ways of immigration from</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.019" end="00:36:48.289" style="s2">Ireland from Eastern Europe from</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.109" end="00:36:52.728" style="s2">Jews from Italians and there were of course tensions between the</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.719" end="00:36:57.829" style="s2">But by the standards of human history, they got worked out pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.009" end="00:37:04.309" style="s2">I&#39;ve been capitalizing on a feature of our psychology, which is that even though we do have an in-group favoritism</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.089" end="00:37:08.209" style="s2">We do have tribalism what counts as a tribe is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.759" end="00:37:11.269" style="s2">Elastic it is not by skin color</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.339" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">which is simply every citizen of the country and that ultimately every citizen in larger units including the</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.160" end="00:37:50.089" style="s2">People in your clan. It&#39;s rather hard to do nation building there like in Lincoln High Rock</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.089" end="00:37:53.149" style="s2">For example people don&#39;t have a sense of superordinate</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.710" end="00:39:15.169" style="s2">I read Ben&#39;s book a while back and I think it shares some features</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.960" end="00:39:23.149" style="s2">with your book and it&#39;s shares some features with my book and I would say the features it shares with my book is that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.670" end="00:39:26.570" style="s2">stress the importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.300" end="00:39:29.010" style="s2">judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.010" end="00:39:35.449" style="s2">stories as part of that conceptual substructure that unites a civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.030" end="00:39:41.060" style="s2">Then it has features in common with your book because it&#39;s also a pro</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.780" end="00:39:57.590" style="s2">Like Shapiro sees our culture s and this is something that I agree with I would say as a marriage between that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.990" end="00:39:59.990" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.150" end="00:40:02.420" style="s2">emergent enlightenment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.180" end="00:40:09.889" style="s2">You&#39;re and it&#39;s taught me if I&#39;m wrong, but your emphasis. So let&#39;s say that we&#39;re playing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.619" end="00:40:16.889" style="s2">abstract conceptual game that unites us as a people independent of our ethnicity and our race and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">there are principles that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.830" end="00:40:25.080" style="s2">Constitute the game rules for that agreement and you see those as</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.600" end="00:40:26.650" style="s2">primarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.650" end="00:40:30.690" style="s2">Deriving from the Enlightenment and and and starting then</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.230" end="00:40:36.899" style="s2">Well not I mean there&#39;s nothing new Under the Sun and certainly someone waiting Vijaya T has had</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.660" end="00:40:41.309" style="s2">precursors in the the the Renaissance and in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.310" end="00:40:48.210" style="s2">But that set of ideas that came together that it needed of course further elaboration. I think that that&#39;s much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:54.210" style="s2">basis of human progress than the judeo-christian tradition again any every</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.570" end="00:41:00.870" style="s2">every intellectual movement who draws from pre-existing ideas, and so there was some</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.870" end="00:41:03.870" style="s2">cherry-picking from from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.970" end="00:41:09.209" style="s2">Judeo-christian tradition, but it certainly did not depend on belief in Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.210" end="00:41:14.490" style="s2">Our Savior did not depend on a one God as opposed to many God&#39;s really depended on</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.860" end="00:41:20.490" style="s2">Human well-being life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That&#39;s something you can believe in regardless of your theological commitments</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.500" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">So what what do you think? So here? Here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.550" end="00:41:29.160" style="s2">Question I have about that. Is that like it seemed to me so that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.490" end="00:41:34.019" style="s2">people who formulated the Declaration of Independence, for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.020" end="00:41:42.660" style="s2">accept it as self-evident that human beings were intrinsically valuable and the locus of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.330" end="00:41:49.289" style="s2">sovereignty insofar as they were the citizens who would determine the course of the nation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.540" end="00:41:52.920" style="s2">There&#39;s some recognition there as far as I&#39;m concerned of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.490" end="00:41:55.960" style="s2">Intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.960" end="00:42:02.129" style="s2">Outside of a rational argument, you know it as a as a as an a priori</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.830" end="00:42:05.700" style="s2">presupposition we accept these truths as self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.700" end="00:42:13.230" style="s2">right and and and the the the most fundamental truth of that is that it&#39;s something like in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.020" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">View it&#39;s something like the strange</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.980" end="00:42:19.690" style="s2">metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.690" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">equivalence of man before God the fact that we all have intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.730" end="00:42:28.439" style="s2">Value and that&#39;s where I see the Enlightenment being</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.620" end="00:42:31.620" style="s2">irreducibly</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.690" end="00:42:39.179" style="s2">Embedded inside this underlying structure and that&#39;s that&#39;s different than the idea of progress, which is something that that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:42.510" style="s2">Focusing on and that I think is more</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.240" end="00:42:50.010" style="s2">Attributable to the development. Let&#39;s say of science and technology, but it still seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:57.959" style="s2">The Enlightenment had to have an under structure that enabled it to emerge for those</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">self-evident truths to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:04.260" style="s2">Accepted universally as self-evident and well exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:08.070" style="s2">I agree that there that those aren&#39;t scientific ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.070" end="00:43:14.820" style="s2">And this is these the set of ideas that I draw together under the rubric of humanism. It&#39;s not clear that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:17.320" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.320" end="00:43:21.539" style="s2">Self-evident right to life liberty. The pursuit of happiness is particularly judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.540" end="00:43:26.070" style="s2">I think I don&#39;t think you could find that in US Scripture and in fact in the Jewish tradition</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.740" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">God chose the Jews who were the chosen people so the idea of universal. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.440" end="00:43:38.729" style="s2">Human Worth and well-being. It&#39;s not a particularly Jewish notion. Ali is a particularly Christian notion</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.730" end="00:43:42.180" style="s2">You&#39;ve got to it&#39;s only you you have to accept Jesus in order to</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.820" end="00:43:44.820" style="s2">escape</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.950" end="00:43:52.769" style="s2">Eternal damnation, none of that&#39;s in the Declaration what self-evident is things that are almost prerequisite to even considering?</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:58.469" style="s2">What ought to go into a country or or anything else namely you&#39;ve got to be alive rather than dead</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.200" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">You&#39;ve got to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:09.000" style="s2">Express opinions in order to even have that conversation. So you&#39;ve got freedom happiness as we know from from</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:11.070" style="s2">evolutionary considerations</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.070" end="00:44:16.469" style="s2">It&#39;s basically the set of motives that kept our ancestors alive and allowed us to come into existence in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.840" end="00:44:19.410" style="s2">combating of a grinder of entropy</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.450" end="00:44:25.379" style="s2">So I think that the foundation of that enlightenment we there&#39;s not particularly judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.380" end="00:44:28.140" style="s2">But more existential it just comes from what are the actual?</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.840" end="00:44:30.840" style="s2">prerequisites to being a</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.980" end="00:44:50.100" style="s2">it&#39;s just that these this is how things have laid themselves out for me and my thinking I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.710" end="00:44:54.599" style="s2">One of the things that&#39;s very interesting about the book of Genesis. Is that it?</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.970" end="00:44:55.870" style="s2">insists that</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.260" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">I if you look at the percentage of years that the great powers they were at war with each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:10.529" style="s2">it actually goes goes down starting in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.230" end="00:54:13.230" style="s2">7th 17th century</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.630" end="00:54:16.500" style="s2">Great power wars don&#39;t even occur anymore. We haven&#39;t had one for</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.260" end="00:54:22.560" style="s2">65 years, but be it is what happened was that that in the centuries after the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.320" end="00:54:25.769" style="s2">18th century there were two trends that we&#39;re in opposite directions</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.230" end="00:54:32.639" style="s2">Which is that Wars actually got shorter and less frequent are the ones that did occur got deadlier. That is</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.490" end="00:54:38.429" style="s2">countries got more efficient at killing more people in a shorter amount of time partly because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.700" end="00:54:44.970" style="s2">weaponry but also just because of social organization being able to can script large numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.210" style="s2">Young men and then send them to the battlefield as cannon fodder</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.820" end="00:54:54.630" style="s2">Until and a lot of that was driven actually by counter Enlightenment ideologies of nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.630" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">which mention both both world wars and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.290" end="00:55:02.970" style="s2">Starting in 1945 for the first time Wars became less frequent</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.390" end="00:55:12.180" style="s2">Shorter and less deadly. And so the first time in I think in human history, you have a systematic move away from</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.000" end="00:55:37.380" style="s2">It did not occur during the time of thee and European enlightenment in the 18th century</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.650" end="01:06:02.470" style="s2">Didn&#39;t I tend to avoid saying I&#39;m a psychologist even though that&#39;s what my degree is a great</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:05.199" style="s2">The people assume that I&#39;m a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.569" end="01:06:10.028" style="s2">Which I&#39;m not so I sometimes say have a cognitive scientist cuz no one has any idea what that mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.029" end="01:06:15.489" style="s2">You know, I think you&#39;d be good for my mental health. Well, that&#39;s what some people for the first time in my life</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.490" end="01:06:20.289" style="s2">I said I kind of learned that credential but some people write and they say I just I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.079" end="01:06:25.538" style="s2">Dejected and discouraged and downtrodden by reading the news that when I come across</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.789" end="01:06:33.099" style="s2">The data being presented that humanity has been improving. It actually is is good for my mental health. I don&#39;t feel as despairing or</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:36.789" style="s2">for my children for myself for the future</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.529" end="01:06:43.869" style="s2">You&#39;re also it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not only that you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.450" end="01:06:48.309" style="s2">Deeper than that for a couple of reasons. I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.099" end="01:06:51.278" style="s2">you&#39;re a credible source and like</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.329" end="01:06:58.599" style="s2">Naive optimism is worse than cynical pessimism, I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.390" end="01:07:00.859" style="s2">Because it&#39;s too fragile</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.859" end="01:07:03.999" style="s2">it&#39;s too we damaged but your</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.490" end="01:07:09.639" style="s2">Optimism isn&#39;t naive it&#39;s it&#39;s data based and it&#39;s well researched</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.640" end="01:07:16.359" style="s2">and so you can go in there as a pessimist like as a powerful pessimist and you can think oh, oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.150" end="01:07:23.500" style="s2">Well, look at that look at that and and look at that and and it&#39;s not just one or two things</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.500" end="01:07:25.150" style="s2">It&#39;s enough things</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.150" end="01:07:28.119" style="s2">So that starts to be a story and you think oh well</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.520" end="01:07:34.389" style="s2">Maybe we&#39;re not going to hell in a handbasket quite as fast as we thought we were and then not necessarily. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.390" end="01:07:34.780" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.780" end="01:07:40.540" style="s2">at least not necessarily yes well and that starts something but then there&#39;s a there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.030" end="01:07:43.239" style="s2">implicit message there too, which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:49.899" style="s2">Perhaps the Enlightenment message itself, which is that. Well, not only are things getting better</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.109" end="01:07:57.639" style="s2">but human beings are the sorts of creatures that could make things better if they chose to and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.099" end="01:08:00.099" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.800" end="01:08:07.539" style="s2">Radical message I think I mean one of the things I&#39;ve noticed about what people respond positively to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.880" end="01:08:09.880" style="s2">in my lectures is my</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.880" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">insistence to them that they could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.809" end="01:08:17.559" style="s2">They may not be but they could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:25.149" style="s2">Powerful forces for good and powerful beyond really in some ways beyond the limits of their imagination</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.150" end="01:08:27.150" style="s2">Is that human beings?</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.500" end="01:08:28.759" style="s2">unbounded</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.759" end="01:08:35.349" style="s2">Rationally, even from an Enlightenment perspective independent of the metaphysics is that we do have the capacity to address</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.290" end="01:08:40.120" style="s2">incredibly complicated problems and with good will and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:44.710" style="s2">caution and a certain degree of intelligence we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.410" end="01:08:48.489" style="s2">Make them better and I think that that&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.549" end="01:08:55.869" style="s2">positive message especially for young people who&#39;d be raised on nothing but a steady diet of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.960" end="01:09:01.239" style="s2">disenfranchisement and like nihilistic pessimism about the future</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.630" end="01:09:07.660" style="s2">Indeed and and it has been a source of tension in my own</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.449" end="01:09:11.169" style="s2">intellectual autobiography because and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.350" end="01:09:18.740" style="s2">know that I&#39;m not an optimist about the human condition by but by ideology or by background fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.740" end="01:09:22.309" style="s2">I wrote a book called the blank slate on the modern denial of human nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.280" end="01:09:30.229" style="s2">we&#39;re not blank slates that we are equipped by evolution with that not a lot of motives some of which are not not so</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.020" end="01:09:34.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t smell so conducive to human well-being like tribalism like</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.010" end="01:09:41.809" style="s2">authoritarianism like my greed like cognitive illusions like self exception, but that what what</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.690" end="01:09:43.700" style="s2">shifted my worldview</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.700" end="01:09:46.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really coming across data that came is as much of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.890" end="01:09:51.680" style="s2">Surprise to me as to anyone showing that violence is going down and it is fun</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.710" end="01:09:57.980" style="s2">How did prosperity is gone up and then have tried to resolve that attention? How could me as a species both?</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.010" end="01:10:01.010" style="s2">burn each other alive and</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.080" end="01:10:03.530" style="s2">engage in in rate the discrimination and genocide</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.660" end="01:10:10.010" style="s2">I mean the other hand somehow managed to power this improvement and I think it comes from the fact that we have more</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.680" end="01:10:14.659" style="s2">Cognitively and psychologically complex. We have a number of ugly motives</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.670" end="01:10:19.190" style="s2">But we also have some modicum of empathy we have self-control</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.430" end="01:10:20.970" style="s2">We have cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.970" end="01:10:24.619" style="s2">Processes that allow us to reason we have language that allows us to share our ideas</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.810" end="01:10:31.069" style="s2">and if we manage to channel those with the right institutions with a commitment to free speech to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.530" end="01:10:34.879" style="s2">democracy to science to empirical testing</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.340" end="01:10:42.080" style="s2">Then we can mobilize the better angels of our nature as Abraham and and kind of eke out</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.080" end="01:10:48.530" style="s2">Its of improvement despite our worst selves. I think it&#39;s quite comical that you used a religious seller</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.200" end="01:10:53.720" style="s2">Analogy title. I mean because I think part of the case that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.720" end="01:10:58.280" style="s2">and I would say this is a narrative case to some degree is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.830" end="01:11:01.039" style="s2">Despite the depth of human depravity</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.350" end="01:11:05.959" style="s2">Which is definitely something that you did discuss in the blank slate</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.150" end="01:11:10.460" style="s2">Although not as intensely as some people have that good</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.310" end="01:11:16.789" style="s2">so to speak has the capacity to triumph over evil and and sorrow</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:21.979" style="s2">Despite the depths of both of those and that that is also an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.230" end="01:11:27.709" style="s2">optimistic message because I don&#39;t believe that you can be a credible voice for</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.440" end="01:11:31.609" style="s2">opt ISM and and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.730" end="01:11:34.730" style="s2">What would you say?</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.940" end="01:11:38.359" style="s2">Someone who celebrates the human spirit</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.270" end="01:11:45.770" style="s2">Unless you&#39;re very cognizant of its Darris because otherwise you&#39;re just not informed, you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.410" end="01:11:48.410" style="s2">right enemy</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.780" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">That&#39;s right, and you have to I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.230" end="01:11:57.679" style="s2">Value the hard-won human institutions and norms that don&#39;t actually necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.620" end="01:12:00.620" style="s2">Come naturally to us</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.870" end="01:12:04.969" style="s2">Like the rule of law like like free speech like empirical</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:09.020" style="s2">facing arguments on a caracal data things that are have to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.110" end="01:12:13.370" style="s2">Inculcated every generation. We&#39;re not doing such a good job with</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.040" end="01:12:16.969" style="s2">Generation, I sometimes think but it&#39;s because of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.820" end="01:12:24.500" style="s2">these games that we&#39;ve invented that bring out our our better side that we have been able to overcome our our</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.590" end="01:12:31.489" style="s2">Inner demons are darker angels. I wonder sometimes - I wonder what you think about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.489" end="01:12:35.119" style="s2">I mean, you know when I grew up and when you grew up</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:42.379" style="s2">You know from the end of World War two until let&#39;s say 1989</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.860" end="01:12:49.130" style="s2">there were real reasons for apocalyptic thinking and in my estimation, you know, they</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.710" end="01:12:50.730" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.730" end="01:12:54.709" style="s2">massive buildup of the thermo nuclear arsenal and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.650" end="01:12:58.310" style="s2">constant tension and testing between</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.340" end="01:13:01.940" style="s2">especially the Soviets and and the Western bloc</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.210" end="01:13:08.509" style="s2">They at the times when we came so close to nuclear annihilation, I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.150" end="01:13:11.150" style="s2">for several generations</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.699" end="01:13:17.689" style="s2">And then also in the 60s the discovery of human beings as a as let&#39;s say a planet</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.270" end="01:13:23.299" style="s2">Transforming force on an ecological level. I think there were real reasons for people to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:26.239" style="s2">terrified into a kind of apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:33.589" style="s2">pessimism and I kind of wonder sometimes if one of the things that you&#39;re not battling against is</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.820" end="01:13:41.630" style="s2">What would you say is is the revelation that that period of time in some sense is over</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.630" end="01:13:45.069" style="s2">Is that that particularly pound lips god-willing?</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.579" end="01:13:47.579" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:55.989" style="s2">Reduced substantially in probability and we can now start to think about the future in a positive way again</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.989" end="01:13:57.989" style="s2">But man, it was 45 years</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.969" end="01:14:05.919" style="s2">You know and not counting World War 2 which I think we probably shouldn&#39;t count. It was 45 years where everyone was</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.369" end="01:14:12.279" style="s2">Well being being taught that if they put themselves under their desks as elementary school</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.440" end="01:14:16.779" style="s2">Yes, I was gonna protect them from an atomic blast. And so</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.960" end="01:14:19.960" style="s2">Coming out of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.059" end="01:14:23.469" style="s2">Now, that&#39;s true. I think 1989 truly was momentous</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.079" end="01:14:29.229" style="s2">It was the the end of the Cold War and the worst threats of nuclear exchange</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.230" end="01:14:35.619" style="s2">It also led to a decline in the number of proxy wars in Asia and Africa and South America</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.869" end="01:14:42.399" style="s2">Which people don&#39;t appreciate look at the horrific wars that are taking place now such as in Yemen and Syria</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">and you might think that were in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.900" end="01:14:50.829" style="s2">Unprecedented area of warfare, but this is nothing compared to the seventies and eighties were Africa was in flames. They were</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.409" end="01:14:56.409" style="s2">The word that man killed far more people than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in Syria</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.989" end="01:14:58.070" style="s2">combined</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.070" end="01:15:02.049" style="s2">There were threats like I mean the Yom Kippur War in 1973</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:05.439" style="s2">Richard Nixon raised the level of nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.139" end="01:15:08.139" style="s2">alert something that has not happened since</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.570" end="01:15:11.829" style="s2">these really were perilous times is it&#39;s quite apart from</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.260" end="01:15:19.480" style="s2">The Cold War Iran and Iraq are their version world war one which threatened to choke the flow of oil out of Persian Gulf</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.699" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">bringing the world economy to a halt and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.719" end="01:15:25.839" style="s2">so the people forget how</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.510" end="01:15:30.789" style="s2">How awful these 60 seventies and eighties were in terms of right?</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.070" end="01:15:36.159" style="s2">It was also the fact that well in Africa and in South America, I would say in particular</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.010" end="01:15:39.039" style="s2">Those proxy wars also</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.159" end="01:15:42.489" style="s2">being also ideological Wars</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.309" end="01:15:44.570" style="s2">Absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.570" end="01:15:52.299" style="s2">Stifled economic development both in South America and in Africa and one of the reasons that we&#39;ve seen this unparalleled</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.480" end="01:15:56.169" style="s2">Improvement in economic conditions. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.980" end="01:16:04.750" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s obvious in China because of their market reforms but in Africa is at least in part because there aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.750" end="01:16:06.470" style="s2">isn&#39;t a coterie of</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.460" end="01:16:19.300" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely encounter productive and pathological and so just by removing that source of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.870" end="01:16:28.180" style="s2">Trouble much less adding anything new and good just by getting that source of trouble the Africans have been able to</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.670" end="01:16:32.289" style="s2">free themselves from the worst excesses of the most foolish</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.600" end="01:16:38.590" style="s2">Economic theories of the 20th century and I are really is it started to manifest itself in the 2000s?</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.080" end="01:16:43.240" style="s2">that was part of it and there is each effect is the others so that</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.730" end="01:16:50.410" style="s2">Poverty makes civil war more likely and vice versa because war is system called development in Reverse</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.660" end="01:16:57.820" style="s2">And that nothing is worse for an economy. Then if schools are being blown up and people pulled out of their offices and shot and</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.340" end="01:17:01.509" style="s2">Institutions destroyed as quickly as they can be built markets</p>

<p begin="01:28:39.900" end="01:28:42.230" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk to Ben because okay. I</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.080" end="01:28:47.509" style="s2">Think we could have a good conversation, you know and scrap it out a bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.060" end="01:28:50.600" style="s2">and see if we could get somewhere because I</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.210" end="01:28:52.550" style="s2">Really liked your books</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.550" end="01:28:52.969" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.969" end="01:28:55.849" style="s2">I really liked enlightenment now and I regard myself</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.340" end="01:29:03.650" style="s2">In many ways as as a pearl enlightenment figure. I mean, I&#39;m very scientifically minded. There are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.860" end="01:29:11.000" style="s2">empirical research and learned a tremendous amount from it and I certainly believe that the mastery of</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.760" end="01:29:14.840" style="s2">Science and technology has been a major</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.600" end="01:29:17.220" style="s2">contributor to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.220" end="01:29:18.540" style="s2">furtherance of</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.540" end="01:29:24.950" style="s2">Human wellbeing and and there&#39;s something to be said for the solidity of an objective</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.350" end="01:29:27.350" style="s2">materialist view of the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.420" end="01:29:31.549" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s an element there that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.150" end="01:29:34.620" style="s2">Troublesome that</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.620" end="01:29:40.849" style="s2">Leads to a kind of nihilism which which interestingly enough you happened to be fighting with some of your optimism</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.920" end="01:29:42.920" style="s2">which is quite quite nice to see</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.530" end="01:29:46.969" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s fertile discussion there too to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.700" end="01:29:49.140" style="s2">reconcile</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.140" end="01:29:52.519" style="s2">Maybe to reconcile some of the unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.040" end="01:29:59.959" style="s2">tension between the different streams of thought that have made Western culture and world culture for that matter the</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.720" end="01:30:02.160" style="s2">remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.160" end="01:30:04.160" style="s2">creation that it actually is I</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.880" end="01:30:07.880" style="s2">Think that could be fruitful deed</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.700" end="01:30:15.169" style="s2">Alright, well, is there anything else that you&#39;d like to mention to people any forthcoming talks?</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.170" end="01:30:20.930" style="s2">You have or public appearances or things you&#39;d like to draw their attention to or are we?</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.690" end="01:30:23.780" style="s2">Are we at the end of a fruitful discussion?</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.550" end="01:30:28.550" style="s2">Problem is we could just keep going</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.680" end="01:30:30.919" style="s2">so where to start I will be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.530" end="01:30:34.219" style="s2">Often on the road. I&#39;m often giving public public</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.740" end="01:30:40.280" style="s2">Lectures and discussions. I have one. I&#39;m having a public event Paul Krugman next week at Brown University</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.740" end="01:30:44.869" style="s2">Nothing next week by the time you circulate speaking the past tense. It&#39;s my turn</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.390" end="01:30:51.049" style="s2">But you&#39;re on my website. I have a listen about going. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Well, it&#39;s pretty fun to see that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.570" end="01:30:55.490" style="s2">public audience for this sort of discussion named who would have guessed what</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.800" end="01:30:59.900" style="s2">Much more than anyone would have guessed just about five years ago. He admits. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.320" end="01:31:06.950" style="s2">Absolutely another reason for optimism</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.340" end="01:31:10.340" style="s2">Let&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.350" end="01:31:13.789" style="s2">very nice talking to you and thank you very much for taking the time and</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.490" end="01:31:16.440" style="s2">good luck with your</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.440" end="01:31:18.440" style="s2">your talks and your and your</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.110" end="01:31:21.920" style="s2">academic endeavors and with your attempts to</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.890" end="01:31:24.890" style="s2">help people</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.290" end="01:31:27.290" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.679" end="01:31:31.999" style="s2">Reason to be hopeful now and perhaps even more reason to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.909" end="01:31:40.519" style="s2">Hopeful in the future and about people that&#39;s a hell of a thing for someone who doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a blank slate</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.760" end="01:31:49.010" style="s2">Indeed. Thank you, and thanks for having me on great pleasure talking with you. Thanks very much. Okay, thank you. Let&#39;s stay in touch</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.560" end="01:31:51.560" style="s2">Bye. Bye</p>
